However, the current infrastructure of clinical trials supporting innovative drug approvals is challenged by an increased body of knowledge concerning tumor biology and therapy resistance, a fast-growing armamentarium of novel anti-cancer compounds, an impressively upscaled data analysis capacity, as well as increasing costs related to clinical trials' management. In this scenario, modern clinical trial designs need to evolve to expedite new drug approvals by tailoring patients' treatment strategies according to their medical needs. Balanced, patient-oriented, clinical trial designs are eagerly warranted to increase their efficiency, to include the fast-pace of technological innovations and scientific discoveries, and ultimately to face the challenges of the modern medical oncology field.",,,,Copyright © 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology.

40085126,Stable and discriminating OCT-derived radiomics features for predicting anti-VEGF treatment response in diabetic macular edema.,"anti‐VEGF therapy, diabetic macular edema, discriminability, radiomics, spectral domain‐optical coherence tomography, stability",Medical physics,"Radiomics-based characterization of fluid and retinal tissue compartments of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans has shown promise to predict anti-VEGF therapy treatment response in diabetic macular edema (DME). Radiomics features are sensitive to different image acquisition parameters of OCT scanners such as axial resolution, A-scan rate, and voxel size; consequently, the predictive capability of the radiomics features might be impacted by inter-site and inter-scanner variations.
The main objective of this study was (1) to develop a more generalized classifier by identifying the OCT-derived texture-based radiomics features that are both stable (across multiple scanners) as well as discriminative of therapeutic response in DME and (2) to identify the relative stability of individual radiomic features that are associated with specific spatial compartments (e/g. fluid or tissue) within the eye.
A combination of 151 optimal responders and rebounders of anti-VEGF therapy in DME were included from the PERMEATE (imaged using Cirrus HD-OCT scanner) and VISTA clinical trials (imaged using Cirrus HD-OCT and Spectralis scanners). For each patient within the study, a set of 494 texture-based radiomics features were extracted from the fluid and the retinal tissue compartment of OCT images. The training set ( 
The model 
Our study suggests that incorporating both stable and discriminatory texture-based radiomic features extracted from fluid and retinal tissue compartments of OCT scans, a more generalized radiomic classifier can be developed to predict therapeutic response in DME. Also, the feature stability was found to be a function of the spatial location within the eye from where the features were extracted.",,The model ,,© 2025 The Author(s).

Comparing recruitment strategies on participant accrual and cost can inform the use of cost-effective recruitment strategies for enrollment of diverse populations of cancer patients. In this study, we compared social media, internet sites, and clinic-based recruitment on accrual, cost, and characteristics of cancer patients (i.e., sociodemographic, cancer type/stage, and smoking habits) enrolled in a randomized trial of app-based smoking cessation interventions. Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables were used to compared data between recruitment strategies. In 35 months, 427 cancer patients from 45 US states enrolled in the trial out of 3,936 screened (rate of participation, 10.8%). Social media recruited over eight times the number of enrolled participants (n=340, 79.6%) compared with Internet sites (n=43, 10.1%) and clinics (n=42, 9.8%).

While most adverse events (AEs) associated with T-DXd are manageable, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis is a notable AE of special concern. This review describes the incidence, severity, and management of T-DXd-induced ILD/pneumonitis across different tumors. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for literature published up to 13 September 2024, regarding the use of T-DXd in the treatment of HER2-positive tumors. Studies included were clinical trials involving HER2-positive tumors with reported ILD/pneumonitis cases.The main data extracted from the full-text articles included the incidence and severity of T-DXd-induced ILD. 18 studies involving 3380 patients with various advanced solid malignancies were included in our review. The overall incidence of adjudicated drug-related ILD/pneumonitis was 12.40%. Although most ILD/pneumonitis cases were low-grade, the risk of ILD/pneumonitis-related death should not be overlooked. Given the prolonged exposure to the drug, careful monitoring and management of T-DXd-induced ILD/pneumonitis are critical. Management strategies include dose reduction, treatment interruption, discontinuation, corticosteroids, and supportive care.

Endocrine therapy (ET) combined with CDK4/6 inhibitors is the first-line standard of care, yet resistance mechanisms, including ESR1 mutations, drive disease progression. Novel oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents after progression with CDK4/6 inhibitors secondary to ESR1 mutations. However, the available studies on SERDs differ in design, study population, and outcomes, necessitating a critical review of available data.
This review explores the mechanisms, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles of oral SERDs in HR-positive, HER2-negative mBC, particularly following progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors. Recent key clinical trials, including EMERALD, SERENA-2, EMBER-3 and AMEERA-3, are analyzed, highlighting their efficacy in overcoming resistance, especially in ESR1-mutant populations.
Oral SERDs offer enhanced bioavailability and convenience compared to fulvestrant, representing a critical advancement in endocrine therapy. Their integration into treatment strategies, particularly in combination regimens and ctDNA-driven approaches, may improve patient outcomes and address resistance mechanisms. However, other than ESR1 mutations, clinical refinement for patient selection is limited. Further trials are needed to optimize patient selection for oral SERD use and define the most effective combination strategies with oral SERDs.",,,,,10.1080/14737140.2025.2479604,2025-03-14,"Taha Koray Sahin, Sercan Aksoy, Deniz Can Guven"

Patients received standardised digital pretest information, with saliva sampling and consent to testing completed at home. For individualised support, we offered access to a clinical genetics professional via a telephone helpline (TH).
To evaluate the utilisation, uptake and resource requirements for provision of the TH, we analysed data from structured call logs recorded in the BRCA-DIRECT Study. Mixed-methods analysis included combining quantitative data from call logs and patient demographics with thematic analysis of free-text notes establishing reasons for calls. Additional data were analysed from structured telephone interviews.
Calls were received from 201/1140 (17.6%) patients. We identified that 84.6% of calls (274 calls, 1097 min) pertained to 'administrative' support needs only. The remaining 15.4% required a clinical genetics professional (50 calls, 344 min). Of the clinical calls received: 26.0% were placed prior to test consent, 36.0% while awaiting results and 38.0% post results, with median (interquartile) call lengths of 8 (4-10) min; 5.5 (4-10) min; and 5 (3-7) min, respectively.

40080789,System-Level Transformations to Increase Patient Participation in Clinical Trials.,,JCO oncology practice,"Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration allowed cancer clinical trials to make modifications. As policymakers consider sustaining these modifications, understanding patient perspectives on impact is critical.
This cross-sectional study used survey data collected between August 2021 and September 2021 by the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium and December 2022 by Patient Advocate Foundation among female breast cancer survivors. Respondents reported how changes to location, telemedicine, convenience, and opting out of certain procedures would affect their willingness to participate in a trial. Respondents' county-level vulnerability was determined using five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard codes to link to the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) overall theme (range, 0-1). According to the SVI, the most vulnerable counties are those in the upper 10% of the overall theme. Model-estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multinomial logistic regression models to explore the association between county-level social vulnerability and willingness to participate.
Overall, 573 women were included, 12% lived in the most vulnerable counties, and 18% had previous trial participation. Over half (53%) reported that they would be very willing to participate in a trial that offered medication delivery to the home. When compared with all other counties, respondents in most vulnerable counties did not have increased willingness to participate in a trial using telemedicine (OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.63]). Results were similar for all other trial modifications, though not statistically significant.

Special emphasis is placed on the structural dynamics of protein complexes that are integral to the regulation of these signaling cascades. Dysregulation of cellular signaling is a fundamental aspect of BC pathophysiology, with both upstream and downstream signaling cascade activation contributing to cellular process aberrations that not only drive tumor growth, but also contribute to resistance against current treatments. The review explores alterations within these pathways across different BC subtypes and highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. Additionally, the influence of specific mutations on therapeutic decision-making is examined, underscoring their relevance to particular BC subtypes.

The primary endpoint was time to first change in photographic breast appearance (FAST) or time to first grade ≥2 RTOG bladder or bowel toxicity (CHHiP). The secondary endpoint in FAST was breast fibrosis.
The dataset included 103 FAST and 297 CHHiP trial patients. No significant association of RILA with the primary endpoint was observed in the FAST trial. However, the risk of grade ≥2 breast fibrosis was lower in patients with RILA ≥24% compared to those with RILA ≤16% (p = 0.012). In the CHHiP trial, no significant associations were found between CDA after prostate radiotherapy outcomes.

Despite the rising incidence, MBC research remains limited, with most data extrapolated from female breast cancer (FBC). This study evaluated the clinicopathological features, treatment strategies, and survival outcomes of MBC patients in Portugal over two decades.
A retrospective analysis of MBC cases from the Portuguese National Oncology registry (2001-2021) was conducted. Clinicopathological features, therapeutic strategies, and overall survival (OS) were assessed across three disease categories: localized, locally advanced, and metastatic. Hormone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, and Ki-67 index were recorded, and survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.

The current review aimed to demonstrate the potential of isoflavones to eliminate cancerous cells in the stomach, liver, lung, breast, and prostate, as their anticancer properties are due to the ability to block the signaling pathways of the extracellular signal-controlled kinase (MAPK/ERK) and proteasome (PI3K/AKT/mTOR). Isoflavones can inhibit the cell division of various cancer cells. Isoflavones can block the androgen receptor (AR), a protein that is required for the growth and dissemination of prostate cancer. It initiates the caspase cascade and obstructs the production of new proteins to eliminate lung cancer cells. These inhibit colon cancer cells by entering their G2/M cell cycle phase and inducing apoptosis. These are also known to inhibit the production of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin B1, two proteins that are related to an enhanced risk of colon cancer. These suppress the breakdown of cyclin B1 and CDK2 to stop the development of cancer. Preclinical evidence consistently supports the efficacy of isoflavones in suppressing tumor growth; however, human clinical trials show variability due to differences in bioavailability, metabolism, and dosage. Despite their promise as alternative or adjunctive cancer therapies, limitations such as low solubility, interindividual metabolic variations, and inconsistent clinical outcomes necessitate further large-scale, controlled trials.

However, determining an optimal subsequent therapy following CDK4/6 inhibitor progression remains challenging, especially for tumors lacking actionable mutations. Real-world data suggest that fulvestrant monotherapy is frequently selected in this post-CDK4/6 inhibitor setting. This review examines its therapeutic potential in this evolving landscape. A systematic literature search using PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov identified 153 clinical trials published between 2017 and November 2024, from which ten studies met our strict inclusion criteria, focusing solely on fulvestrant monotherapy. These trials encompassed 1038 patients who had prior exposure to CDK4/6 inhibitors. The selected studies were categorized into three groups: monotherapy trials (EMERALD, SERENA-2, AMEERA-3, and ELAINE-1), combination therapy trials (CAPItello-291 and VERONICA), and CDK4/6 inhibitor rechallenge trials (post-MONARCH, PACE, PALMIRA, and MAINTAIN). The median progression-free survival for fulvestrant monotherapy was 3.18 months (range 1.9-5.3 months). Factors affecting the efficacy of fulvestrant monotherapy in second-line therapy include prior treatments, treatment duration, and genetic mutations.

Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors, which are already approved for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, are undergoing extensive testing as monotherapy and in various combinations as a potentially valuable treatment modality in prostate cancer patients. Thus far, a limited number of these studies have published results, which have been largely disappointing.
In this review, we describe the biologic rationale for the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in prostate cancer, the existing clinical data describing their use in prostate cancer, and ongoing clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors as monotherapy and in combination for the treatment of prostate cancer. In particular, we focus on possible resistance mechanisms that may be particularly relevant in prostate cancer patients, leading to de novo and acquired resistance, and we highlight novel strategies that can overcome this resistance.
Current clinical trials are actively working to (1) refine the role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in prostate cancer patients; (2) develop new inhibitors of other cell-cycle targets, such as CDK2 and CDK7; and (3) explore novel combination therapies with inhibitors of other relevant pathways, such as PI3K or MAPK.

Despite its efficacy in clinical trials, variability in patient response, particularly resistance development, highlights the need for tailored therapeutic strategies.
The Inositol Hexakisphosphate Kinase 2 (IP6K2) gene knock out was carried by CRISPR/Cas9 system. The evaluation of biomarkers of apoptosis and relevant pathways was conducted to be assessed. Attachment assay was conducted to verify the binding ability of virus to the host cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis was assessed. Subcutaneous xenograft model was used to evaluate IP6K2 knock out influence in vivo. cBioPortal and TCGA database were applied to analyze genomic alterations in pan-cancer.
IP6K2 was essential for effective Herpes Simplex Virus Type1 (HSV-1) replication and subsequent cell apoptosis, acting through the tumor Protein p53 (p53) and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 1 A (p21) signaling axis.

Treatments for this disease often result in side effects such as pain, fatigue, loss of muscle mass, and reduced quality of life. Physical exercise has been shown to effectively mitigate these side effects and improve the quality of life in patients with breast cancer.
This randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week supervised exercise program on pain, physical function, and quality of life in female patients with cancer.
This randomized, double-blind clinical trial will recruit 325 participants, divided into an intervention group receiving the exercise program and a control group receiving standard care recommendations. Outcome measures, including pain (assessed via the Brief Pain Inventory), physical function (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire), and quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-BR23), will be evaluated at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 12 weeks post intervention. Statistical analysis will involve repeated measures of ANOVA and MANOVA to determine the significance of the intervention's effects across time points.
Recruitment and data collection will commence in February of 2025, and data analysis is scheduled for completion at the end of 2025. No results are currently available.
Physical exercise is anticipated to play a significant role in alleviating pain, enhancing physical function, and improving the quality of life in female patients with cancer. This study will provide robust evidence to support the integration of supervised exercise into standard care protocols for this population.

We previously demonstrated that IL-24 leads to apoptosis in cancer cells through protein kinase A (PKA) activation in human breast cancer cells. To better understand the mechanism by which IL-24 induces apoptosis, we analyzed the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase in cancer cells and a downstream target of PKA. Our studies show for the first time that GSK3β is inhibited following IL-24 treatment in human prostate cancer cells. We showed that the inhibition of GSK3β is mediated through PKA activation triggered by IL-24. IL-24 decreases the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, substantially activating glycogen synthase and decreasing intracellular glucose levels. Notably, the expression of a constitutively active form of GSK3β abolishes the effect of IL-24. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of IL-24 in apoptosis mediated through GSK3β regulation and its possible implications for metabolic stress, mitochondria dysfunction, and apoptosis. Future studies should precisely delineate the most effective combinations of IL-24 as a GSK3β inhibitor with cytotoxic agents for prostate and other cancers. GSK3β inhibition disrupts average glucose utilization in cancer cells, potentially creating metabolic stress that could be exploited therapeutically.",,,,,10.3390/cells14050357,2025-03-12,"Anastassiya Kim, Sual Lopez, Simira Smith, Alphons Sony, Jennifer Abreu, Columba de la Parra, Moira Sauane"

To evaluate the effect of mindfulness therapy on anxiety and depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients, as psychological distress significantly affects their quality of life and often persists despite medical treatment.
A computerized search of Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials involving the effects of positive thinking interventions on anxiety and depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients. The search was conducted from the time of database construction to December 2023. Two researchers completed literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, and then analyzed using RevMan 5.4 software.
A total of 15 studies involving 1823 patients were included. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that anxiety scores [mean difference (MD) = -0.67, 95% CI (-1.05, -0.29), p = 0.0005] and depression scores [MD = -2.26, 95% CI (-2.91, -1.61), p < 0.00001] were lower in the positive mindfulness intervention group than in the control group after the intervention, and the difference was statistically significant. Meanwhile, the follow-up time (>8 weeks vs ≤8 weeks) had little effect on the improvement of patients' depression and anxiety scores. The distribution of studies was unsymmetrical, and there was a certain degree of publication bias.

However, economic evaluations are needed.
This study aims to conduct a cost-utility analysis of an app for ePRO and interactive support from the perspective of the payer (Region Stockholm Health Care Organization) and to explore its impact on patient health care utilization and costs.
Two open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted, including patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (B-RCT; N=149) and radiotherapy for prostate cancer (P-RCT; N=150), recruited from oncology clinics at 2 university hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were mapped to EQ-5D-3L to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Intervention and implementation costs and health care costs, obtained from an administrative database, were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 3 ways: including all health care costs (ICERa), excluding nonacute health care costs (ICERb), and excluding health care costs altogether (ICERc). Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to explore ICER uncertainty. Health care costs were analyzed by classifying them as disease-related or acute.
In both RCT intervention groups, fewer QALYs were lost compared with the control group (P<.001). In the B-RCT, the mean intervention cost was €92 (SD €2; €1=US $1.03). The mean cost for the intervention and all health care was €36,882 (SD €1032) in the intervention group and €35,427 (SD €959) in the control group (P<.001), with an ICERa of €202,368 (95% CI €152,008-€252,728). The mean cost for the intervention and acute health care was €3585 (SD €480) in the intervention group and €3235 (SD €494) in the control group (P<.001). ICERb was €49,903 (95% CI €37,049-€62,758) and ICERc was €13,213 (95% CI €11,145-€15,281); 22 out of 74 (30%) intervention group patients and 24 out of 75 (32%) of the control group patients required acute inpatient care for fever. In the P-RCT, the mean intervention cost was €43 (SD €0.2). The mean cost for the intervention and all health care was €3419 (SD €739) in the intervention group and €3537 (SD €689) in the control group (P<.001), with an ICERa of -€1,092,136 (95% CI -€3,274,774 to €1,090,502). The mean cost for the intervention and acute health care was €1219 (SD €593) in the intervention group and €802 (SD €281) in the control group (P<.001). ICERb was €745,987 (95% CI -€247,317 to €1,739,292) and ICERc was €13,118 (95% CI -68,468 to €94,704). As many as 10 out of the 75 (13%) intervention group patients had acute inpatient care, with the most common symptom being dyspnea, while 9 out of the 75 (12%) control group patients had acute inpatient care, with the most common symptom being urinary tract infection.
ePRO and interactive support via an app generated a small improvement in QALYs at a low intervention cost and may be cost-effective, depending on the costs considered. Considerable variability in patient health care costs introduced uncertainty around the estimates, preventing a robust determination of cost-effectiveness. Larger studies examining cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective are needed. The study provides valuable insights into acute health care utilization during cancer treatment.

While randomized trials remain the accepted standard for causal inference, trial data are not always available to inform clinical decisions, and some questions cannot be answered feasibly or efficiently with trials. In these settings, studies using observational healthcare data may be used to inform practice. Causal inference from observational data has been reconsidered in recent years, challenging the prevailing notion among clinical researchers that causal conclusions cannot be drawn from observational studies. The ""target trial framework"" is one contribution within a growing methodologic field that helps investigators avoid common pitfalls in observational study design and analysis.

Novel agents that may reverse MDR and neutralize drug-resistant cancer cells are highly desirable for clinical practice. The targeting of cellular redox homeostasis and/or mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism are promising strategies for the suppression of drug-resistant cancer cells. Based on the structure of mono-gold(I) complex auranofin (AF), a drug candidate under clinical trials for cancer, we synthesized a new dual-gold(I) complex QB1561 and tested if it can inhibit drug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

While the focus has largely been on the neoplastic cells themselves, the characterization of the associated stroma remains largely underexplored, with significant implications for understanding metastasis.
By employing spatially resolved transcriptomics, we analyzed the transcriptional features of primary breast adenocarcinoma and its associated metastatic foci, on a representative set of microregions. We identified a stromal metastatic (Met) signature, which was subsequently validated across transcriptomic reference human breast cancer (BC) datasets and in spatial transcriptomics of a murine model.
We discuss the potential of a stromal Met signature to pinpoint metastatic breast cancer, serving as a prognostic tool that can provide a foundation for the exploration of tumor-extrinsic molecular hallmarks of BC metastatic foci.",,,"We discuss the potential of a stromal Met signature to pinpoint metastatic breast cancer, serving as a prognostic tool that can provide a foundation for the exploration of tumor-extrinsic molecular hallmarks of BC metastatic foci.",© 2025.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was prospectively evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline, during treatment (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and during follow-up. Our objective was two-fold: to analyse the impact of APAD on HRQoL using three approaches; to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and derive methodological recommendations. Analytical approaches utilised were: statistical testing to compare the mean HRQoL scores between baseline and end of study in both groups and the mean HRQoL scores between the two groups at the different assessment times; linear mixed models that modelled the longitudinal score data in both groups and tested whether the score trajectories were different between the groups; a survival analysis comparing the time to deterioration of HRQoL between the groups using a minimal clinically important difference. This study shows a substantial clinical benefit of the APAD intervention on HRQoL, especially for global health status/HRQoL, functioning scales and the fatigue symptom scale. Furthermore, this study highlights the advantages and disadvantages of three standard approaches used to analyse HRQoL data.Trial registration: The APAD1 study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01495650, date 20/12/2011).",,,,© 2025.

T-DXd is also indicated for unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, following prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or recurrent disease within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in treating HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients in a real-world clinical setting. In the T-DXd pivotal research, imaging assessments were conducted every six weeks with CT or MRI, but outside of a clinical trial setting, this frequent imaging is practically challenging due to resources and difficulty in reimbursing. In addition to clinical outcome assessments, we sought to review the incidence of pneumonitis in a real-world setting and to assess if the three-monthly response assessment scans would be sufficient to rule out asymptomatic pneumonitis.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients diagnosed with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or in situ hybridization (ISH) positive) or HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ and ISH negative) MBC treated with T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg every 21 days, with standardized dose adjustments as required. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median follow-up duration was 15 months. Responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, and toxicity was determined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Data analysis was performed using SPSS IBM software version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, NY, US).
The median age of the patients was 47 years, ranging from 29 to 86 years, with the majority being younger than 65 and predominantly women. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 at baseline. Most patients were HER2-positive, while a smaller proportion were classified as HER2-low. A significant number of patients presented with visceral disease, while a smaller subset had brain metastases at the time of baseline evaluation. Nearly half of the patients were hormone receptor-positive (HR+), and more than half had a high Ki-67 index of over 20%. The majority of patients received T-DXd as a second- or third-line treatment. Clinical responses included partial response, complete response, and stable disease. Survival outcomes showed high overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 24 months. Only one patient experienced grade 3 pneumonitis, suggesting that 12-weekly imaging assessments may be adequate for monitoring most patients.
Our real-world experience confirms that the efficacy of T-DXd in UAE is consistent with published data from published phase 3 clinical trials. The incidence of clinical pulmonary toxicity is much lower than anticipated, and until further data is available, it may be reasonable to continue using the 12-weekly assessment scans to monitor patients for interstitial lung disease (ILD).

Though, it's been proved for its health benefits due to the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols and coumarins, its role as an anti-neoplastic agent still requires comprehensive investigation. In our study, we have investigated the presence of potential anti-neoplastic phytocompounds, anti-inflammatory, cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic activity of Shallots against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.
Phytocompounds of aqueous Allium ascalonicum extract (AAE) derived from GC-MS and LC-MS analysis were docked with an inflammatory marker, Interleukin-18 (IL-18); anti-apoptotic proteins, B-cell Lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1 (MCL-1); and metastatic marker, Vimentin using PyRx (Version 0.9.9). Subsequently, the anti-inflammatory property of AAE was determined using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Denaturation Assay and the chemotherapeutic potential of AAE was determined using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay on MDA-MB-231 and HEK293T cell lines. Additionally, to determine the synergistic effect of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Standard) and AAE, MTT assay was performed on MDA-MB-231 cell lines treated with the combination therapy. Furthermore, the anti-metastatic property of AAE was determined using cell migration and clonogenic assays. Finally, Dual Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide fluorescence staining method was used to determine if AAE has the ability to induce apoptosis and necrosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Molecular docking results using the compounds obtained from LC-MS and GC-MS with the target proteins revealed promising anti-neoplastic bioactive compounds. BSA Denaturation assay proved that AAE has anti-inflammatory property, with the highest, 85.78% observed at 2 mg/ml of AAE.

This study evaluates its impact on patients with gynecological or breast cancer specifically.
A thorough search for studies comparing IF with either nonintervention diets or calorie restriction (CR) in patients with either gynecological or breast cancer and published prior to October 5, 2024 was carried out on the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases (CBM). Extracted data included but not limited to body mass index (BMI), body weight, waist circumference (WC), fasting glucose, insulin levels, chemotherapy-related toxicity, and subjective perceptions.
A total of 625 subjects were included across 7 randomized controlled trials, and 2 nonrandomized trials.

Novel immune targets and technical advances are driving a rapid exploration of new treatment strategies incorporating immune agents in cancer clinical practice. Immunotherapies perturb a complex system of interactions among genomically unstable tumor cells, diverse cells within the tumor microenvironment including the systemic adaptive and innate immune cells. The drive to develop increasingly effective immunotherapy regimens is tempered by the risk of immune-related adverse events. Evidence-based biomarkers that measure the potential for therapeutic response and/or toxicity are critical to guide optimal patient care and contextualize the results of immunotherapy clinical trials. Responding to the lack of guidance on biomarker testing in early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials, we propose a definition and listing of essential biomarkers recommended for inclusion in all such protocols. These recommendations are based on consensus provided by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Clinical Immuno-Oncology Network (SCION) faculty with input from the SITC Pathology and Biomarker Committees and the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer readership. A consensus-based selection of essential biomarkers was conducted using a Delphi survey of SCION faculty. Regular updates to these recommendations are planned. The inaugural list of essential biomarkers includes complete blood count with differential to generate a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio or systemic immune-inflammation index, serum lactate dehydrogenase and albumin, programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry, microsatellite stability assessment, and tumor mutational burden. Inclusion of these biomarkers across early-phase immunotherapy clinical trials will capture variation among trials, provide deeper insight into the novel and established therapies, and support improved patient selection and stratification for later-phase clinical trials.",,,,© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Real-world data can provide external controls, but insufficient accrual affects all arms of a study, not just controls. Studies that used generative models to simulate more patients were limited in the accrual scenarios considered, replicability criteria, number of generative models, and number of clinical trials evaluated.
This study aimed to perform a comprehensive evaluation on the extent generative models can be used to simulate additional patients to compensate for insufficient accrual in clinical trials.
We performed a retrospective analysis using 10 datasets from 9 fully accrued, completed, and published cancer trials. For each trial, we removed the latest recruited patients (from 10% to 50%), trained a generative model on the remaining patients, and simulated additional patients to replace the removed ones using the generative model to augment the available data. We then replicated the published analysis on this augmented dataset to determine if the findings remained the same. Four different generative models were evaluated: sequential synthesis with decision trees, Bayesian network, generative adversarial network, and a variational autoencoder. These generative models were compared to sampling with replacement (ie, bootstrap) as a simple alternative. Replication of the published analyses used 4 metrics: decision agreement, estimate agreement, standardized difference, and CI overlap.
Sequential synthesis performed well on the 4 replication metrics for the removal of up to 40% of the last recruited patients (decision agreement: 88% to 100% across datasets, estimate agreement: 100%, cannot reject standardized difference null hypothesis: 100%, and CI overlap: 0.8-0.92). Sampling with replacement was the next most effective approach, with decision agreement varying from 78% to 89% across all datasets. There was no evidence of a monotonic relationship in the estimated effect size with recruitment order across these studies. This suggests that patients recruited earlier in a trial were not systematically different than those recruited later, at least partially explaining why generative models trained on early data can effectively simulate patients recruited later in a trial. The fidelity of the generated data relative to the training data on the Hellinger distance was high in all cases.
For an oncology study with insufficient accrual with as few as 60% of target recruitment, sequential synthesis can enable the simulation of the full dataset had the study continued accruing patients and can be an alternative to drawing conclusions from an underpowered study. These results provide evidence demonstrating the potential for generative models to rescue poorly accruing clinical trials, but additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to generalize them for other diseases.",,"Sequential synthesis performed well on the 4 replication metrics for the removal of up to 40% of the last recruited patients (decision agreement: 88% to 100% across datasets, estimate agreement: 100%, cannot reject standardized difference null hypothesis: 100%, and CI overlap: 0.8-0.92).

Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of the MAPK pathway with a MEK inhibitor is synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
We conducted a phase I/II trial of pembrolizumab and binimetinib in patients with metastatic TNBC with ≤ 3 prior lines of therapy. There were two dose levels (DL) with binimetinib at 45 mg at DL 0 and 30 mg at DL -1.
The recommended phase II dose was the standard dose of pembrolizumab with binimetinib 30 mg twice daily. The objective response rate (ORR) was 30.4%, with a numerically higher ORR in patients without liver metastasis at 45.5%. Among patients who achieved objective responses, 80% had a duration of response > 12 months and ongoing even after stopping treatment (5.4 - 69.0 months). Patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (CPS ≥ 10) were more likely to respond with an ORR of 66.7%. However, clinical benefit was observed in 25% of patients with PD-L1-negative tumors.

Earlier research has indicated a potential link between cathepsins and liver cancer. Nonetheless, there have been limited clinical trials examining the connection between cathepsins and PLC. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the causal relationship between cathepsins and PLC.
Data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focusing on cathepsins was collected. Additionally, summary data for GCST90018803 (Hepatic bile duct cancer, HBDC), and GCST90018858 (related to hepatic cancer, HC), were employed in the discovery and validation phases of the study, respectively. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was served as the primary analytical method in our Mendelian randomization (MR) study, supplemented by the MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods. To assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy, we conducted the MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, as well as the MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) analysis, along with the leave-one-out analysis. After that, bioinformatic analysis based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were utilized, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were utilized for exploring the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, protein-protein docking was employed to confirm the interaction between related proteins.
The results showed that cathepsin F (CTSF), was causally associated with HBDC. CTSF decrease the risk of HBDC (OR = 0.826, 95% CI 0.711-0.959, P = 0.012). CTSF may play protective roles in patients with HBDC. No heterogeneity or pleiotropy was observed. Additionally, the expression of CTSF genes is lower in patients with HBDC, GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis revealed CTSF were mainly related to cell cycle, and P53 pathway in HBDC. Docking results showed that CTSF had good binding ability with MDM2, the most well-established negative regulator of p53.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors and to ascertain the optimal exercise regimen for this patient population.
A comprehensive search was conducted across Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus until 28 October 2023. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Exercise significantly alleviated depression (SMD, -0.63, p < 0.0001) and anxiety (SMD, -0.49, p = 0.0002) in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, aerobic exercise (SMD, -0.44, p = 0.03) and multicomponent training (SMD, -0.86, p = 0.002) were found to be particularly effective in alleviating depression. However, only multicomponent training significantly alleviated anxiety (SMD, -0.66, p = 0.003) in breast cancer survivors. Additionally, multicomponent training conducted for ≥ 3 times per week (depression, SMD, -1.22, p = 0.006; anxiety, SMD, -0.93, p = 0.004) and ≤ 60 min per session (depression, SMD, -1.19, p = 0.002; anxiety, SMD, -0.85, p = 0.005) were deemed most effective in alleviating depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors.
Exercise significantly alleviated depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors, with multicomponent training being the most effective intervention type.

Electronic medical records from the ConcertAI Patient360™ database were analyzed in U.S. patients exposed to goserelin 3.6 mg or 10.8 mg post-breast cancer diagnosis. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to ensure the comparability between the two cohorts (goserelin 3.6 mg and goserelin 10.8 mg). The non-inferiority of goserelin 10.8 mg compared with goserelin 3.6 mg was assessed by 12-month real-world event-free survival (rwEFS) rates (- 15% margin) for the overall group of patients and separately for patients with early-stage/locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer.
A total of 575 patients received goserelin 3.6 mg and 123 received goserelin 10.8 mg.

40049207,Dose optimisation to improve access to effective cancer medicines.,,The Lancet. Oncology,"Access to many cancer medicines on WHO's Essential Medicines List (EML) is restricted because of price, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Other cancer medicines that have been shown to improve survival, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer, are not included on the EML because approved doses and schedules exceed affordable prices in LMICs. Multiple strategies are therefore needed to reduce medicine costs or circumvent these problems, such as optimising doses and schedules. Cancer medicines are approved by regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, following rigorous clinical trials. However, these approvals can involve dosing regimens and treatment schedules that, although effective in showing statistically significant benefits in trials, can be higher in intensity, frequency, or duration than is necessary to achieve meaningful improved survival. In clinical practice, these regimens can lead to concerns about balancing optimal therapeutic outcomes with the risk of side-effects, patient quality of life, and long-term health effects. Various types of evidence can, and should, be used to explore and show near-equivalence of beneficial outcomes from reduced-intensity treatments, including randomised clinical trials, dose-finding phase 1 and 2 studies, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. The positive effects of proving that lower doses or less intensive schedules retain therapeutic activity include reduced toxicity and large price reductions, leading to better cost-effectiveness and greater access to treatments that improve survival. Beyond regulatory approvals, identification of regimens that have similar outcomes with reduced doses and less intense schedules should be a priority for clinicians and policy makers in the selection process to identify effective medicines at national and global levels.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 World Health Organization.

Oncology,"The optimal scheduling of PD-1 inhibitors with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer is unknown. We aimed to investigate the activity of two differing schedules of neoadjuvant nivolumab initiation with 12 weeks of carboplatin and paclitaxel for this patient population.
Neo-N is an investigator-initiated, non-comparative, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial conducted at 12 hospitals in Australia, one in New Zealand, and one in Italy. Participants had to be aged 18 years or older; have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, clinical stage I (cT1cN0) or II (cT1cN1, cT2cN0-1, or cT3cN0), oestrogen receptor expression of less than 1%, and progesterone receptor expression of less than 10%; had to be HER2 negative; and have previously untreated operable breast cancer with adequate organ function. Participants were stratified according to age and randomly assigned (1:1) centrally using a computer-generated sequence with a minimisation algorithm to either nivolumab 240 mg then 2 weeks later nivolumab 360 mg and carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks with concurrent paclitaxel 80 mg/m
Between July 6, 2020, and April 1, 2022, 124 participants were enrolled and 14 were ineligible. 110 participants were randomly assigned and 108 were included in the modified intention-to treat analysis (53 in the lead-in group and 55 in the concurrent group). Median follow-up was 12 months (IQR 7-18). All patients were female with a median age of 49 years (IQR 43-60). 18 (17%) patients had clinically node-positive disease; 37 (34%) had clinical stage I, 70 (65%) had stage II, and one (1%) had stage III disease. The pathological complete response rate was observed in 27 (51% [39-63]) of 53 patients in the nivolumab lead-in group and in 30 (55% [43-66]) of 55 in the concurrent group. Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 70 (65%; 32 [60%] of 53 in the lead-in group and 38 [69%] of 55 in the concurrent group) of 108 patients, with the most common being decreased neutrophil count (25 [47%] of 53 in the lead-in group vs 28 [53%] of 55 in the concurrent group), anaemia (six [11%] vs ten [19%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (three [6%] vs three [6%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 16 (30%) patients in the lead-in group and 26 (47%) in the concurrent group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in seven (13%) patients in the lead-in group and 20 (36%) in the concurrent group. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study.
While this study did not support the hypothesis that lead-in nivolumab before chemotherapy was associated with a pathological complete response advantage, high pathological complete response rates were reached supporting shorter duration, non-anthracycline regimens in patients with newly diagnosed triple-negative breast cancer. Future trials are warranted to compare this regimen with the current standards of care.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend refining the prognostic information provided by clinical and pathology features with the use of genomic tests, such as Oncotype DX®, to classify cancers into risk groups and inform adjuvant treatment strategies. However, the clinical value (i.e., prognostic and/or predictive) and applicability of these assays vary due to differences in the clinical setting, especially in those populations that were underrepresented in pivotal clinical trials.

40047411,Nonhormonal Treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause.,,Cardiology in review,"Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), such as hot flashes and night sweats, are experienced by over 80% of women during menopause and can significantly impair quality of life. While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the gold standard for managing VMS, concerns over its association with breast cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and thromboembolic events have led to increasing interest in nonhormonal alternatives. This review explores the efficacy and cardiovascular safety of nonhormonal treatments for VMS. Given the heightened risk of CVD in postmenopausal women due to estrogen deficiency, the ideal nonhormonal therapy should not only alleviate VMS but also mitigate cardiovascular risks. Various nonhormonal options, including lifestyle modifications, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacological agents such as SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, clonidine, and the emerging class of neurokinin-3 receptor antagonists, are examined. Clinical trials demonstrate that SSRIs (eg, paroxetine) and SNRIs (eg, venlafaxine) provide significant VMS relief, particularly for women who are unable to use HRT. Neurokinin-3 receptor antagonists, such as fezolinetant, show promising results in reducing hot flashes without affecting cardiovascular health. While more research is needed to further assess long-term outcomes, nonhormonal therapies present a viable and safer alternative for managing VMS, especially for women at risk for cardiovascular complications.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

40046748,Dual inhibitor of MDM2 and NFAT1 for experimental therapy of breast cancer: ,"MDM2, NFAT1, cancer metabolism, dual inhibitor, p53, triple negative breast cancer",Frontiers in pharmacology,"The oncogene MDM2 has garnered attention not only for its role in cancer as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 but also for its p53-independent oncogenic activities. MDM2 also involves metabolic reprogramming, such as serine metabolism, respiration, mitochondrial functions, the folate cycle, and redox balance. Traditional MDM2 inhibitors blocking the protein-protein binding between MDM2 and p53 have shown limited clinical success in various stages of clinical trials, most likely due to low efficacy, drug toxicity, and drug resistance, highlighting the need for a novel, p53-independent strategy to inhibit MDM2. The present study investigated the antitumor effects of MA242, a novel MDM2 and NFAT1 inhibitor, in breast cancer models.
The anticancer activity and underlying mechanisms of MA242 were evaluated in vitro using breast cancer cell lines with different p53 backgrounds and 
We demonstrated that MA242 significantly inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells, regardless of p53 status. Metabolic analysis revealed that MA242 notably disrupted nicotinamide metabolism, modified nucleotide metabolism, and elevated cellular oxidative stress by disturbing the redox balance. Furthermore, in animal models, MA242 reduced MDM2 expression and effectively inhibited tumor growth dependent on MDM2 expression without causing host toxicity.

The side effects often lead to treatment non-adherence and the use of anti-hormonal treatments as primary prevention in women with increased risk of breast cancer is very low. We have conducted breast cancer prevention trials aiming to lower the adverse effects of anti-hormones, but with retained effect. For increased two-way communication and to facilitate effective reporting of adverse events we have developed a smartphone application (app), the KarmApp. The aim of our study was to explore the user frequencies of the different features of the app, and if the use is influenced by age and has changed over time.

40043232,Participation in Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Collection as a Part of Routine Supportive Care Delivery in Oncology.,,JCO oncology practice,"The use of electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs) in supportive cancer care can lead to benefits, such as identifying at-risk patients in need of closer monitoring and treatment. Despite these benefits, most studies examining ePROMs in this area were for clinical trials rather than standard care. Since there is a need to identify which patients are more likely to participate in ePROMs, this study assessed ePROM participation rates and factors influencing greater participation among patients receiving supportive care.
This retrospective data analysis took place at a supportive care clinic within a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the southeastern United States. Starting in 2017, ePROM assessments were implemented using tablets for in-person appointments at the clinic. The assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System with additional questions added for other symptoms. Logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression models were used to analyze factors associated with ePROM assessment submission.
The study included 4,780 patients, with 42.7% submitting at least one ePROM assessment. Higher odds of ePROM submission were observed among patients age 35-64 years, had Medicare, had nonmetastatic cancer, or had genitourinary, breast, or multiple cancers. Additionally, higher rates of ePROM submissions were observed among patients who were younger; had GI, breast, or multiple cancers; had nonmetastatic cancer; or had private insurance.

40042985,Axillary surgery versus no-axillary staging in T1N0 breast cancer: 20-year follow-up of the INT 09/98 randomized clinical trial.,,The British journal of surgery,"The role of axillary surgery in breast cancer has shifted over time from a therapeutic operation to a staging method for subsequent adjuvant therapies, through the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy. The discovery of molecular subtypes has since questioned the necessity of axillary staging in breast cancer.
The INT09/98 randomized trial explored the omission of axillary surgery in early-stage breast cancer in patients under 65 years of age. From June 1998 to June 2003, a total of 565 T1N0 breast cancer patients were enrolled. The trial tested the non-inferiority of quadrantectomy without axillary surgery (QU) compared to quadrantectomy with axillary dissection (QUAD). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and incidence/timing of axillary lymph node metastasis in the QU arm.
Follow-up at 20 years showed no significant differences between the QU versus the QUAD arm. The adjusted hazard ratio for OS was 1.18 (P = 0.326) and DFS was 1.27 (P = 0.280) respectively, both within the predetermined non-inferiority limit. Axillary relapse rates in the QU arm remained low, indicating that only a subset of metastatic nodes cause recurrences if not removed. In the QU arm, patients with favourable biological features but unknown axillary node involvement did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, without significant differences in outcomes. The axillary relapse rate with distant metastases was similar in both arms and may reflect aggressive biology of the primary tumour.
Avoiding axillary surgery and reducing adjuvant treatments in early breast cancer does not increase distant metastases or affect long-term survival. Axillary relapsed patients with distant metastases in both QU and QUAD arms may represent cancers with genomically determined poorer prognosis, independent of surgical intervention and adjuvant therapies.

However, they need careful dose optimization to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects. Sometimes, safety issues may only become apparent after approval, so ongoing evaluation is important. This study aimed to assess the benefit-risk profiles of two approved trastuzumab-drug conjugates: trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). A systematic search of MEDLINE on May 1, 2024, identified clinical trials reporting the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of T-DM1 and T-DXd. Summary-level data from 103 trials was used along with model-based meta-analysis to develop population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response models for both ADCs. The study combined the objective response rate (ORR) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) into a composite score called the clinical utility index (CUI) to determine optimal drug exposures and doses that maximize the benefit-risk balance. Different ORR/DLT weights and CUI thresholds representing desired minimum effect size were tested in three scenarios (""only phase I trials,"" ""phase I/II trials,"" and ""all phases""). Using a CUI threshold of 10%, the approved T-DM1 dose of 3.6 mg/kg for breast cancer was found to align with an efficacy-safety (ORR-DLT) ratio of 81:19 with all phases. Applying these weights to the T-DXd analyses successfully predicted the approved T-DXd dose (5.4 mg/kg, breast cancer), showing a CUI improvement compared to the 3.2 mg/kg dose of 8.3%, 8.2%, and 2.4% in the three respective scenarios. Overall, this proof-of-concept assessment of ADCs can save time and costs for pharmaceutical companies and optimize dosing to maximize patient benefit.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

However, HER2+ER+ cancers exhibit lower response rates. The phase 2 NA-PHER2 trial (NCT02530424) investigated chemo-free preoperative HER2 blockade (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) and CDK4/6 inhibition (palbociclib) with or without endocrine therapy (fulvestrant) in HER2+ER+ breast cancer. Clinical endpoints (i.e. Ki67 dynamics and pathological complete response) were previously reported. Here we report on the biomarker analysis, secondary objective of the study. Through RNA sequencing and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) assessment in serial biopsies, we identified biomarkers predictive of pCR or Day14 Ki67 response and unveiled treatment-induced molecular changes. High immune infiltration and low ER signalling correlated with pCR, while TP53 mutations associated with high Day14 Ki67. Stratification based on Ki67 at Day14 and at surgery defined three response groups (Ki67 HighHigh, LowHigh, LowLow), with divergent tumour and stroma expression dynamics. The HighHigh group showed dysfunctional immune infiltration and overexpression of therapeutic targets like PAK4 at baseline. The LowLow group exhibited a Luminal A phenotype by the end of treatment.

We evaluated the effectiveness of patient-centered pathology reports (PCPRs), which translate pathology results into patient-friendly language.
Sixty-six participants newly diagnosed with breast cancer were randomized to receive either a PCPR and standard pathology report (intervention arm) or a standard pathology report alone (control arm). Patients were surveyed at initial pathology disclosure and 1 month later to assess breast cancer knowledge and ratings of decisional confidence, conflict, and self-efficacy for treatment decision-making. Knowledge was assessed for four pathology domains independently.
Accuracy of breast cancer knowledge across all domains trended higher for the intervention group compared with the control group (66% vs. 50%, p = 0.11); cancer type and surgical margin status knowledge domains exceeded 75% accuracy for the intervention group.

Due to similarities of cellular mechanisms between human cells and such infections, PTM has also been proposed for repurposing in non-infectious diseases such as cancer. Indeed, by modulating different signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, p53, PD-1/PD-L1, etc., PTM has been shown to inhibit different properties of cancer, including proliferation, invasion, migration, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, while inducing anti-tumor immune responses and apoptosis. Given the promising implications of PTM for cancer treatment, however, the clinical translation of PTM in cancer is not without certain challenges. In fact, clinical trials have shown that systemic administration of PTM can be concurrent with serious adverse effects, e.g. hypoglycemia. Therefore, to reduce the administered doses of PTM, lower the risk of adverse effects, and prevent any potential drug resistance, while maintaining the anti-tumor efficacy, two main strategies have been suggested. One is combination therapy that employs PTM in conjunction with other anti-cancer modalities, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and attacks tumor cells with significant additive or synergistic anti-tumor effects. The other is developing PTM-loaded nanocarrier drug delivery systems e.g. pegylated liposomes, chitosan-coated niosomes, squalene-based nanoparticles, hyaluronated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles, etc., that offer enhanced pharmacokinetic characteristics, including increased bioavailability, sit-targeting, and controlled/sustained drug release. This review highlights the anti-tumor properties of PTM that favor its repurposing for cancer treatment, as well as, PTM-based combination therapies and nanocarrier delivery systems which can enhance therapeutic efficacy and simultaneously reduce toxicity.",,,,© 2025.

Somatic acupressure (SA) has been recommended as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for cancer-related fatigue (the core symptom of the FSDSC) in the guidelines, showing its encouraging role in relieving cancer-related sleep disorders, fatigue and depression. This phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) is designed to evaluate the effects, safety and cost-effectiveness of SA for managing the FSDSC in BC survivors.
This phase III RCT will be a partial-blinded, sham-controlled, three-arm, parallel clinical trial, involving a 7-week SA intervention period and a 12-week follow-up period. 108 BC survivors will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1:1 to either a true SA group (self-administered acupressure plus usual care), a sham SA group (self-administered light acupressure at non-acupoints plus usual care) or a usual care group. The primary outcomes will be the effectiveness of SA on the FSDSC at both the individual symptom level and cluster symptom level. Each individual symptom will be specifically measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (fatigue), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (sleep disturbance) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (depression). The cluster symptom level will be measured by using an FSDSC composite score, an averaging score of three separated 0-10 numeric rating scales for fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance. The secondary outcomes will include QoL (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (week 0), immediately after intervention (week 7) and follow-up (week 19). All outcomes will be analysed based on the intention-to-treat principle using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS 25) software.

40030121,Undisclosed Conflicts of Interest in Japanese Cancer Clinical Trials: A Cross-Sectional Study of Author-Pharmaceutical Industry Financial Relationships.,,JCO oncology practice,"Conflicts of interest (COIs) in medical research can introduce biases affecting research integrity. This study investigated the scale and disclosure of COIs among Japanese authors of cancer clinical trials.
Fifty-eight cancer randomized controlled trials from 2020, involving 226 Japanese authors, were systematically abstracted and analyzed. The financial relationships between these authors and pharmaceutical companies were examined using payment data from 56 companies for the years 2018-2019. COI statements were extracted from each publication, and COI declaration rates were calculated by comparing declared companies against those that reported payments. The analysis was conducted at both the author and article levels. For author-level analyses, the declaration rate was calculated per declaration rather than per author. For article-level analyses, payments were aggregated and attributed to their respective articles.
Phase III trials comprised 82.8% (48/58) of the included studies. Of 226 authors, 202 (89.4%) were medical doctors and 208 (92.0%) received at least one payment. The median number of companies providing at least one payment per author was 9 (IQR, 4-12), with a median total payment of $19,183 US dollars (USD; IQR, $5,158-$62,534 USD). Among 280 unique disclosures from authors with payments, only 29 (10.4%) accurately reported COIs, whereas 80 (28.6%) reported no COIs. For 58 articles, only two (3.4%) accurately reported COIs, seven (12.1%) reported no COIs, and 49 (84.5%) partially disclosed COI information.

Digital and social media are dominant sources of health information and offer optimal opportunities to improve public medical awareness and education by providing accurate and trustworthy health information from reliable sources. Infotainment, material intended to both entertain and inform, is an effective strategy for engaging and educating audiences that can be easily disseminated using social media and may be a novel way to improve awareness of and recruitment in clinical trials.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an infotainment video promoting a clinical trial, disseminated using social media, could drive health information seeking behaviors.
As part of a video series, we created an infotainment video focused on the promotion of a specific cancer clinical trial. We instituted a dissemination and marketing process on Facebook to measure video engagement and health information seeking behaviors among targeted audiences who expressed interest in breast cancer research and organizations. To evaluate video engagement, we measured reach, retention, outbound clicks, and outbound click-through rate. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were used to summarize each measure.
The video substantially increased health information seeking behavior by increasing viewership from 1 visitor one month prior to launch to 414 outbound clicks from the video to the clinical trial web page during the 21-day social media campaign period.

An analysis of the safety of ribociclib after its marketing based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Why was the study done? Ribociclib, as an anti-cancer drug mainly applied to breast cancer patients, is now widely used. However, its comprehensive safety profile remains unrevealed. The researchers aim to use the adverse event reports registered in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to give a general view of adverse events of ribociclib in the real-world clinical practice after its marketing. What did the researchers do? The researchers collected reports from the first quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2023, analyzed the data and detected the signals of adverse events associated with ribociclib at different levels utilizing four different statistical methods. How is the study designed? This study is a disproportionality analysis, which analyzed the past data from the FAERS database. What did the researchers find? The researchers analyzed 12,885 reports in which ribociclib was suspected as the primary cause of the adverse event. Here are the main findings: - Almost half of the adverse events occur in the first 60 days of ribociclib using. - “Blood and lymphatic system disorders” and abnormalities in “Investigation” showed significant signals in all four methods used. Nausea, neutropenia, vomiting, white blood cell count decreased, and alopecia were the five most common adverse events with ribociclib. These were consistent with previous clinical trials. - 28 adverse events undiscovered in the drug label were identified. - Among the widely recognized adverse events, neutropenia could result in more serious outcomes than common knowledge.

40025472,Exploring Zanidatamab's efficacy across HER2-positive Malignancies: a narrative review.,"Bispecific antibody, Efficacy, HER2, Malignancies, Outcome, Targeted therapy, Zanidatamab",BMC cancer,"HER2-positive cancers involve amplification or overexpression of the HER2 gene, leading to aggressive tumor growth across several cancer types, including breast, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Detection methods such as immunohistochemistry, next-generation sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization are used, with new advancements like biosensors and circulating tumor DNA offering improved diagnostic potential. Treatment strategies have evolved, including anti-HER2 drugs like trastuzumab and newer agents like zanidatamab, which show promise against HER2-positive malignancies.
A comprehensive search of the following academic databases was performed including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov. A detailed search string was made. Studies were selected based on whether they contained the keywords and if they reported the details of treatment for zanidatamab. A total of 16 studies were selected. Abstracts were independently examined by one author and critically reviewed by another and if there were any conflicting viewpoints they were discussed until consensus was reached.
Zanidatamab has shown promising clinical outcomes in several HER2-positive cancers, including biliary tract, breast, gastric, and lung cancers, with high disease control rates and progression-free survival. Although it is not yet FDA-approved, it has received priority review for HER2-positive biliary tract cancer, with an FDA decision expected in November 2024. The safety profile of zanidatamab has been well-studied. The most common side effects include diarrhea, infusion reactions, and other mild to moderate treatment-related adverse events. In combination with Palbociclib for HER2-positive breast cancer, more severe side effects were observed, resulting in some patients discontinuing treatment. However, no treatment-related deaths have been reported across trials. While its anticancer efficacy and manageable safety profile are promising, long-term safety and efficacy data are still needed. Early clinical trials demonstrate strong efficacy, though some side effects, such as diarrhea and decreased ejection fraction, were noted. Future research should focus on understanding potential resistance mechanisms and establishing zanidatamab's broader role in the treatment landscape of HER2-positive cancers.
In summary, zanidatamab has shown significant tumor response, progression-free survival, disease control, and improved quality of life in early trials, however, the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data remains a key limitation, requiring further research.",,,"In summary, zanidatamab has shown significant tumor response, progression-free survival, disease control, and improved quality of life in early trials, however, the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data remains a key limitation, requiring further research.",© 2025.

Inhibition of PFKFB3 impairs DNA repair after irradiation of cancer cells, making it a possible radiosensitization target. The SweBCG91RT trial, in which breast cancer patients were randomized to postoperative radiotherapy or not, was used to investigate PFKFB3 as a clinical marker of sensitivity to adjuvant radiotherapy.
Nuclear protein levels of PFKFB3 were assessed with immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumors (n = 970) and whole-cell RNA levels with microarray gene expression (n = 765). Multivariable competing risks regression analysis was employed for the effect of radiotherapy on incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), depending on PFKFB3 levels.
Tumors with high levels of nuclear protein and RNA had the largest effect on incidence of IBTR of adjuvant radiotherapy, however without evidence of an interaction. PFKFB3 RNA correlated with subtype, as high levels were more common among the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and Luminal A subtypes than Luminal B and triple negative tumors.
High PFKFB3 is associated with a larger reduction of IBTR after radiotherapy but PFKFB3 cannot reliably be used as a predictive marker of sensitivity to adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer.

Its major role in tumor growth makes it a key target for cancer therapeutics, offering significant potential to slow tumor progression and enhance patient outcomes. Gain-of-function mutations, gene amplifications, and the loss of regulatory proteins like PTEN are frequently observed in malignancies, contributing to tumor development and resistance to conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy. As a result, PI3K inhibitors have received a lot of interest in cancer research. Several kinds of small-molecule PI3K inhibitors have been developed, including pan-PI3K inhibitors, isoform-specific inhibitors, and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, each targeting a distinct component of the pathway. Some PI3K inhibitors such as idelalisib, copanlisib, duvelisib, alpelisib, and umbralisib have received FDA-approval, and are effective in the treatment of breast cancer and hematologic malignancies. Despite promising results in preclinical and clinical trials, the overall clinical success of PI3K inhibitors has been mixed. While some patients may get substantial advantages, a considerable number of them acquire resistance as a result of feedback activation of alternative pathways, adaptive tumor responses, and treatment-emergent mutations. The resistance mechanisms provide barriers to the sustained efficacy of PI3K-targeted treatments. This study reviews recent advancements in PI3K inhibitors, covering their clinical status, mechanism of action, resistance mechanisms, and strategies to overcome resistance.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The treatment of breast cancer in this population is often complicated by frailty, comorbidities and polypharmacy. This review explores the application of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG), in treating breast cancer among elderly populations. The underrepresentation of older patients in clinical trials complicates efficacy and safety assessments in this group. Current evidence indicates that ADCs are both effective and tolerable in elderly patients, demonstrating improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) alongside a manageable safety profile. Data from several trials like the EMILIA, TH3RESA and DestinyBreast studies demonstrate that T-DM1 and T-DXd maintained benefit in PFS and OS for HER2-positive breast cancer in older patients, despite a slight increase in adverse events. The ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 trials further confirm that SG provides significant improvements in PFS and OS in elderly patients at the cost of an increase in some toxicity. Emerging ADCs, including datopotamab deruxtecan and ARX-788, show promise but lack extensive geriatric-specific data.

Breast cancer cells often spread to the brain (brain metastases) or the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (leptomeningeal disease). Therapies to treat these serious conditions are limited. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which targets a protein called HER2 (found on the surface of breast cells to control their growth) and includes a powerful anti-cancer component to kill the tumor cells, has shown clinically meaningful results in both HER2-positive (high concentration of HER2 proteins) and HER2-low (low concentration of HER2 proteins) breast cancers. Interestingly, T-DXd has successfully worked in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal disease, but results in their HER2-low counterparts are limited. TUXEDO-4 is a medical study to evaluate the effectiveness of T-DXd in HER2-low breast cancer patients with recently diagnosed or worsening brain metastases, with or without aggressive leptomeningeal disease. The study is taking place in Austria and Spain, and will recruit 27 adult patients.

40018013,Exploring Punicalagin Potential Against Cancers: A Comprehensive Review.,"androgen receptor, anticancer, antitumor, cancers, cell proliferation, colon cancer, phytochemical, punicalagin",Food science & nutrition,"Punicalagin, being a bioactive polyphenol, has gained significant interest owing to its potential anticancer effects. Researchers are studying punicalagin to determine its ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. This paper focuses on highlighting the therapeutic potential of punicalagin against tumors and cancers. Punicalagin inhibits tumor growth within the body through various cellular pathway interactions. This compound effectively eliminates tumor cells from the liver, stomach, prostate, and lungs. Different animal model studies have demonstrated the potential of punicalagin in blocking the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, fighting against cancer. Through the inhibition of cell division, punicalagin may be capable of eradicating breast cancer cells. Punicalagin strongly inhibits the activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and uPA. Punicalagin effectively inhibits the androgen receptor (AR), a protein essential for the development and metastasis of prostate cancer. Lung cancer cells can be eliminated by initiating the caspase cascade and inhibiting protein synthesis, which is facilitated by punicalagin. In numerous animal models, punicalagin significantly reduces metastasis. Cyclokinase B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 promote colon cancer; when colon cancer cells reach the G2/M phase, punicalagin induces apoptosis by inhibiting the action of these proteins. Punicalagin inhibits tumor development and cancer propagation by inhibiting blood vessel proliferation. There is still a need for further clinical trials and studies to fully reveal punicalagin's potential as well as its safety; despite the fact that it may decrease the threat of increasing tumors and provide an alternative treatment for many cancers.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

She originally presented with estrogen receptor-positive disease, and we were able to clearly demonstrate transformation into triple-negative SCNCB via serial tissue biopsies. This is the first reported case of SG for SCNCB, and it shows an outstanding response in a patient who had undergone prior systemic therapies. Clinical trials are needed to address the potential role of TROP2 inhibition and the use of SG as a therapy for SCNCB.
Exceptional response with TROP2 inhibition in a patient with small cell carcinoma of the breast A particularly rare subtype of breast cancer is primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast (SCNCB). Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, the small cell subtype is more aggressive and is associated with poorer outcomes. Current standard treatment of SCNCB mimics treatment used for small cell carcinoma of other organs, such as small cell lung cancer, which includes platinum chemotherapy combined with etoposide and immune checkpoint inhibition. However, treatment outcomes continue to remain poor, and there is a need to address further treatment options for SCNCB. Thus, we present the first reported case of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) (trodelvy) for SCNCB, showing outstanding response in a patient who had undergone prior systemic therapies. Further research is needed to address the potential role for TROP2 inhibition and the use of SG as a therapy for SCNCB.",,,,"© The Author(s), 2025.

A within-trial cost-utility analysis was performed alongside an international randomized trial (EAGLE-FM) with 36 months follow-up from a health system perspective. Healthcare costs were measured by using trial records, and effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Deterministic sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of changes in costs or quality of life on overall results. Statistical bootstrapping was employed to estimate confidence intervals around the cost-utility ratio.
Among 98 trial participants (IL n = 50, I-IL n = 48), with no pelvic or distant disease clinically or on PET/CT imaging, the mean life years saved for those randomized to IL showed a small but nonsignificant increase of 0.05 years compared with those in the I-IL group (2.56 vs. 2.51 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.78 to 0.87). The mean difference in QALYs gained showed a small but nonsignificant increase of 0.04 QALYs (1.95 vs. 1.91, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.57). The mean hospital stay among IL patients was 6.16 days, 1.24 days shorter than I-IL patients (7.40 days) at 36 months follow-up. Mean per-patient healthcare costs of IL surgery were AU$6938 lower than for I-IL surgery ($26,555 vs. $33,493, 95% CI -$24,360 to $10,484).

PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras) represent an innovative strategy for the specific degradation of tar-get proteins through the UPS (Ubiquitin-Proteasome System). In comparison to conventional protein inhibitor medications, PROTAC offers advantages in terms of efficacy, selectivity, and the ability to overcome drug resistance in cancer treatment, contributing novel perspectives to the field of anti-cancer drug discovery. Proteins play vital roles in an organism's health, and misfolded contributes to diseases like neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Cells maintain protein balance through quality control systems, primarily the UPS and autophagy. Protac, a Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) strategy, utilizes UPS, employing small molecules to induce targeted protein degradation. PROTAC exhibits promise in preclinical studies and clinical trials for diverse cancers. Notable examples in-clude breast cancer, where PROTAC targets CDK4/6 (cyclin-dependent kinase) and Estrogen Recep-tors (ER), prostate cancer, addressing Androgen Receptor (AR) degradation, hematologic malignan-cies, focusing on AURORA-A and CDKs, and NSCLC (Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer), targeting Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (EGFR), and KRAS.

40011118,AI in Breast Cancer Imaging: An Update and Future Trends.,,Seminars in nuclear medicine,"Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming breast cancer imaging by enhancing diagnostic capabilities across multiple imaging modalities including mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicines techniques. AI is being applied to diverse tasks such as breast lesion detection and classification, risk stratification, molecular subtyping, gene mutation status prediction, and treatment response assessment, with emerging research demonstrating performance levels comparable to or potentially exceeding those of radiologists. The large foundation models are showing remarkable potential in different breast cancer imaging tasks. Self-supervised learning gives an insight into data inherent correlation, and federated learning is an alternative way to maintain data privacy. While promising results have been obtained so far, data standardization from source, large-scale annotated multimodal datasets, and extensive prospective clinical trials are still needed to fully explore and validate deep learning's clinical utility and address the legal and ethical considerations, which will ultimately determine its widespread adoption in breast cancer care. We hereby provide a review of the most up-to-date knowledge on AI in breast cancer imaging.",,,,Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

40010764,Phase I study of ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) with spartalizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) with and without fulvestrant in metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer or advanced ovarian cancer.,"Breast Cancer, Immunotherapy, Ovarian Cancer",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,"Preclinical evidence suggests that cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors enhance antitumor immunity. We conducted a phase I trial of ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus spartalizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) or advanced ovarian cancer (AOC). The combination was also evaluated with fulvestrant in MBC.
In Cohort A, ribociclib was administered on Days 1-21 (28-day cycle) starting at 400 mg, and spartalizumab at 400 mg on Day 1. Dose escalation was followed by expansion in AOC. Fulvestrant was added (Cohort B) with a safety run-in followed by expansion in MBC. Primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and safety and tolerability of the combinations.
33 patients enrolled (n=18, Cohort A; n=15, Cohort B). The RP2D of ribociclib in both cohorts was 600 mg. Treatment-related adverse events in >20% of patients in either cohort were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertransaminasemia, maculopapular rash, fatigue, and nausea. Hypertransaminasemia occurred in 66.7% (AST) and 46.7% (ALT) of patients in Cohort B, including 46.7% and 40.0%, respectively, of grade 3 or 4 events. Two confirmed partial responses were observed (13.3%) in Cohort B, in patients with low baseline serum thymidine kinase activity, coupled with an increase on-treatment.

40009381,"Genetic Alterations, Therapy Response, and Survival Among Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.",,JAMA network open,"Subgroup definitions for possible deescalation of neoadjuvant cancer treatment are urgently needed in clinical practice.
To investigate the effect of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tumor pathogenic variants (tPVs) by comparing 2 deescalated neoadjuvant regimens (nab-paclitaxel plus either carboplatin or gemcitabine) on pathologic complete response (pCR), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
This was a preplanned secondary analysis of a phase 2 prospective randomized clinical trial (ADAPT-TN) conducted by the West German Study Group (WSG) at 45 sites in Germany between June 2013 and February 2015. The trial enrolled patients with noninflammatory early-stage TNBC (clinical tumor size ≥1 cm; estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression <1%; and ERBB2 negative). DNA samples from pretreatment biopsies were obtained. Genetic analysis was performed between January 2018 and March 2020. Final data analyses took place in September 2023.
Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with nab-paclitaxel plus either carboplatin or gemcitabine; omission of otherwise mandatory anthracycline-containing chemotherapy was allowed in the case of pCR. tPVs in 20 cancer-associated genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, were analyzed using a customized gene panel.
The prevalence of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs and their effect on pCR rate, IDFS, and OS were evaluated using logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression.
Of the 307 patients with DNA samples from pretreatment biopsies available, tumor next-generation sequencing analyses were successful for 266 patients. The 266 patients included in this analysis were female, with a median age of 51 years (range, 26-76 years). A total of 162 patients (60.9%) had a clinical tumor size of 2 cm or greater, and 70 (26.3%) had clinical node-positive disease. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs were detected in 42 patients (15.8%). The highest pCR rate among patients with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs was seen in the nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin group (9 of 14 patients [64.3%]) compared with the nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group (10 of 28 [35.7%]) (odds ratio, 3.24 [95% CI, 0.85-12.36]; P = .08); the highest numeric 5-year IDFS and OS rates (84.4% and 92.9%, respectively) were seen in the nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin group.
In this secondary analysis of the WSG-ADAPT-TN randomized clinical trial on tPVs, deescalated nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin was superior to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, particularly in patients with BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPVs. These findings suggest that BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 tPV status could be a candidate marker for a deescalation strategy in early-stage TNBC; however, prospective validation of survival outcomes in larger cohorts with differentiation between germline and somatic pathogenic variants is necessary.

Therefore, chemotherapy remains the almost-unique systemic treatment for TNBC. However, some targeted therapies are recommended for use in combination with chemotherapy; namely, PARP inhibitors for BRCA-mutated TNBC, the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, as well as the antibody-drug conjugates sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan, the latter for HER2low subtypes. Regardless of the limited benefits they provide, other treatments with similar mechanisms of action are being investigated in advanced clinical stages. Further, therapies that benefit other cancers, like PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and CDK4/6 inhibitors, are still being investigated for TNBC, although convincing results have not been obtained. Given this scenario, it might appear innovation for TNBC treatments has become stuck. However, the huge unmet medical need drives intense research into the biology of the disease. As a result, emerging disruptive therapies are being tested in early-stage trials, designed for novel targets and applying cutting-edge advances in immunotherapy and precision oncology.",,,,,10.3390/cancers17040633,2025-02-26,"Carlos Alonso-Ron, Andrea Vethencourt, Eva González-Suárez, Roke Iñaki Oruezabal"

An OV offers advantages such as good targeting ability and minimal side effects, and it has achieved significant breakthroughs when combined with immunotherapy in recent clinical trials. The development of OVs has become an emerging research focus. PDOs can preserve the heterogeneity of in situ tumor tissues, whereas microfluidic OOC systems can automate and standardize various experimental procedures. These systems have been applied in cutting-edge drug screening and cell therapy experiments; however, their use in functionally complex oncolytic viruses remains to be explored. In this study, we constructed a novel recombinant oncolytic adenovirus, AD4-GHPE, and evaluated OOC systems and PDOs through various functional validations in hypopharyngeal and breast cancer organoids.

SSTR-targeted theranostics may represent a novel potential alternative in a subset of patients with ER + mBC. Its generalized applicability is limited by poor sensitivity for visceral metastases and significant inter-lesion heterogeneity. Future studies must identify how tumor subtype, proliferation, and prior systemic therapies impact SSTR expression levels in these patients to ensure meaningful clinical translation.

39999766,Comprehensive genomic profiling can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Comprehensive genomic profiling, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Triple-negative breast cancer","Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)","The rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) varies, and adjuvant therapy treatment for residual cancer remains a challenge. The aim of our study was to assess the added value of FoundationOne®CDx (F1CDx) testing in the non-metastatic TNBC in predicting responses to NACT and disease outcomes.
Ninety-three eligible patients with stage II-III TNBC were treated with NACT without immunotherapy. Response to NACT was evaluated postoperatively. Comprehensive genomic profiling with NGS-based molecular test F1CDx was performed on diagnostic biopsies (N = 93). Hierarchical clustering and logistic regression were applied for data analysis.
Genomic profiling and data clustering revealed heterogeneous genetic landscapes of TNBC with subsets displaying multilayered co-amplifications of oncogenes and overlapping changes in crucial signaling pathways. TP53 mutations were detected in 95 % of all TNBCs. BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were significant molecular factors in predicting favorable responses to NACT (OR = 0.09, p = 0.002), while CCNDs co-mutations with FGFs (OR = 13.4, p = 0.016) and PI3Ks family mutations in AR-positive cases (OR = 6.1, p = 0.008) - poor responses. Low tumor mutational burden (TMB) ≤ 3 (OR = 9.4, p = 0.009) was a significant factor for the disease progression after NACT.
This study suggests that comprehensive CDx testing can be explored as a prognostic tool in early-stage TNBC to predict responses to NACT and disease progression. Based on these results, genomic analysis should be performed early in the patient journey, possibly guiding adjuvant treatment choices and participation in randomized clinical trials, mainly when pCR is not achieved, as the ultimate goal is improving patient outcomes.",,"Genomic profiling and data clustering revealed heterogeneous genetic landscapes of TNBC with subsets displaying multilayered co-amplifications of oncogenes and overlapping changes in crucial signaling pathways.

Patients aged between 45 and 74 years, were included in the study. For each, a SM in standard resolution (ST) and High Resolution (HR) were obtained, and a 150 x 150 pixels square area was defined on the images to be used for texture analysis of the breast parenchyma. A semi-automated placing strategy was used to reduce user reliance on the segmentation location. S-IBEX software was employed to extract radiomics features. Feature robustness analysis was also done to ensure model reproducibility. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator(LASSO) logistic regression model was trained to predict dichotomized breast density according to BIRADS classification model performance was assessed through receiver operating curves (ROC) for DM, HR, and ST.
We extracted 123 features from the 10 ROIs of 96 patient. After robustness analysis, the most predictive features were employed to build logistic regression-based models. The average performance of the models were 0.74, 0.67, and 0.64 on DM, HR, and ST, respectively, suggesting that DM maintains the highest informative content on breast density.
