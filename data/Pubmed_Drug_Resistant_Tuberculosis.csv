40064371,Study protocol for a duration-randomized clinical trial to determine the optimal length of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with a 5-drug regimen: The DRAMATIC trial.,"Bedaquiline, Clinical trial, Clofazimine, Delamanid, Duration randomization, Levofloxacin, Linezolid, Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis",Contemporary clinical trials,"Current guidelines for the treatment of multidrug-resistant/rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) are based on clinical trials evaluating fixed duration regimens. However, when a regimen succeeds, it remains unknown whether a shorter duration could yield the same results. Similarly, if a regimen fails, it is unclear whether extending the treatment could improve outcomes. Trials are needed to assess the relationship between various treatment durations and outcomes.
We designed a duration-randomized trial of treatment for fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR/RR-TB. The DRAMATIC (Duration Randomized Anti-MDR-TB And Tailored Intervention Clinical) Trial is a multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 trial that examines an all oral, pyrazinamide-free regimen of bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, linezolid, and levofloxacin, with administration of linezolid only in the initial 16 weeks of treatment. The four trial arms are treatment durations of 16, 24, 32 and 40 weeks. Randomization is stratified by ""extensive"" or ""non-extensive"" disease based on baseline smear (or Xpert) and cavitary status. The primary endpoint is relapse-free survival at week 76. The target sample size is 220. Participants are being enrolled in sites in the Philippines and Vietnam. The expected output will be an equation describing the relationship between treatment duration and the proportion of participants with relapse-free survival.
This trial aims to demonstrate that a duration-response relationship can be described for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB by a duration-randomized trial.",,,,2025-03-11,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
40041440,New All-Oral Short-term Regimen for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Semi-randomized Controlled Trial Conducted in China.,"bedaquiline, multidrug resistant, outcome, safety, tuberculosis",Open forum infectious diseases,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an all-oral short-term regimen for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
In this semirandomized, controlled, multicenter clinical study, patients with MDR-TB who were sensitive to fluoroquinolones were assigned to treatment groups at enrollment. Patients were assigned to group C (4-6 months: bedaquiline + linezolid + clofazimine + moxifloxacin + cycloserine; 5 months: clofazimine + moxifloxacin + cycloserine) unless this protocol was unsuitable or unacceptable, in which case they were randomly assigned to group A (4-6 months: isoniazid + ethambutol + pyrazinamide + protionamide + amikacin + clofazimine + moxifloxacin; 5 months: ethambutol + pyrazinamide + clofazimine + moxifloxacin) or group B (4-6 months: isoniazid + ethambutol + pyrazinamide + protionamide + linezolid + clofazimine + moxifloxacin; 5 months: ethambutol + pyrazinamide + clofazimine + moxifloxacin). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving successful outcomes.
From September 2020 to June 2023, 397 patients with MDR-TB were screened and 360 were enrolled. Among them, 90.3% of group C achieved good treatment outcomes, as compared with 57.1% in group A (control) and 75.0% in group B. Group C demonstrated higher sputum culture conversion and pulmonary cavity closure rates than group B, with group A showing the lowest rates. The most common adverse events were skin blackening (29.3%) and hyperuricemia (20.6%). Prolonged QT intervals were observed in 39 participants, predominantly in group C (24.3%).
The all-oral 9- to 11-month short-term regimen shows promise as a new treatment option for MDR-TB. Incorporating bedaquiline into an orally administered regimen may improve treatment outcomes and reduce relapse rates. Despite certain limitations, these findings provide valuable insights for developing improved treatments for MDR-TB in China.",,"From September 2020 to June 2023, 397 patients with MDR-TB were screened and 360 were enrolled.

Research is progressing into the use of new therapeutic regimens that provide more complete TPT. The objective was to analyze the completion and safety of TPT with the drug INH in the form of 300 mg tablets.
Pragmatic, randomized, non-blinded, multicenter clinical trial conducted in Brazil from January 2019 to December 2022. Subjects over the age of 18 years with an indication for TPT was included and those whose index case of active tuberculosis was in retreatment, multidrug-resistant and extremely resistant, transferred, and people deprived of their liberty was excluded. The intervention was TPT with 1 INH 300 mg tablet and the control group with 3 INH 100 mg tablets. The primary outcome was TPT completion. Pearson's chi-square test was used to analyze the association of TPT completion. The risk of TPT completion was estimated by Poisson regression. The mean treatment effect was calculated. The results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (95%CI).
A total of 207 individuals were included, 103 (49.7%) in the intervention group. Seventy-two (69.9%) of the individuals who used INH 300 mg completed TPT. The risk ratio for completing TPT was 1.39 times higher in the group that used the INH 300 mg treatment (RR 1.39, 95%CI 1.08 to 1.79). The mean effect of the intervention was 19% (Coefficient 0.19, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.32). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the groups.

We included clinical trials, operational research and observational studies reporting the efficacy and safety of Pa-based regimens in DR-TB. The duration of the treatment was at least 24 weeks. Efficacy was reported as a favourable/unfavourable outcome and culture conversion. Safety was reported in terms of death and frequency of adverse events of special interest.
Of the 127 articles identified, 13 were included. The proportion of favourable outcomes reported was 76-100%, and the median time to culture conversion was 4-6 weeks. Culture conversion rates ranged from 80-100% by the end of 3 months of treatment, regardless of the type of drug resistance. Treatment completion rates in the operational research studies varied between 18-93%. Safety events were not proportionate among the studies included, possibly due to the differing linezolid dosing (more frequent in the 1,200 mg dose regimen).

39922239,Development and validation of a time-varying correction factor for QT interval assessment in drug-resistant tuberculosis patients.,"Correction factors, Heart rate, QT interval, QT prolongation, Tachycardia, Tuberculosis",International journal of antimicrobial agents,"Tachycardia associated with active tuberculosis (TB) often diminishes when patients recover from TB. Elevated heart rate (HR) may lead to suboptimal correction, complicating the assessment of QT prolongation when using standard correction factors (CFs), such as Fridericia's formula (QTcF). Olliaro has proposed a CF for QT interval correction in pretreatment TB patients. However, the QT-HR correlation changes as HR decreases during treatment, indicating the need for time-varying correction.
We developed an HR model to capture the HR normalisation during successful treatment. Subsequently, a time-varying CF was constructed using the estimated HR change rate. The performance of CFs to make corrected QT (QTc) independent from HR was evaluated by linear regression analyses of QTc versus HR within defined time bins.
The final HR model included asymptotic change in HR attributed to time on treatment, circadian rhythm cycles, M2 (bedaquiline-metabolite) concentration, and patient covariates. The time-varying CF decreased from 0.4081 to 0.33, with a half-life of 7.74 weeks. The slope (QTc/HR vs. Time) derived from the time-varying correction was not significantly different from 0 (95% CI -0.003 to 0.002), and the intercept was not significantly different from 0 (95% CI -0.089 to 0.006), demonstrating successful QT correction from pretreatment to the end of treatment.
The time-varying CF effectively captures the dynamic QT-HR relationship during TB treatment, reducing the risk of misdiagnosing QT prolongation or unnecessary discontinuation of treatment. By addressing underestimation and overestimation issues in QT interval assessment, this method enhances drug evaluation in clinical trials and supports improved treatment decisions for TB patients.",,"The final HR model included asymptotic change in HR attributed to time on treatment, circadian rhythm cycles, M2 (bedaquiline-metabolite) concentration, and patient covariates.

The advent of new drugs to treat tuberculosis and enhanced funding now permit randomized, controlled trials of shortened-duration, all-oral treatments for rifampin-resistant tuberculosis.
We conducted a phase 3, multinational, open-label, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial to compare standard therapy for treatment of fluoroquinolone-susceptible, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis with five 9-month oral regimens that included various combinations of bedaquiline (B), delamanid (D), linezolid (L), levofloxacin (Lfx) or moxifloxacin (M), clofazimine (C), and pyrazinamide (Z). Participants were randomly assigned (with the use of Bayesian response-adaptive randomization) to receive one of five combinations or standard therapy. The primary end point was a favorable outcome at week 73, defined by two negative sputum culture results or favorable bacteriologic, clinical, and radiologic evolution. The noninferiority margin was -12 percentage points.
Among the 754 participants who underwent randomization, 699 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 562 in the per-protocol analysis. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 80.7% of the patients in the standard-therapy group had favorable outcomes. The risk difference between standard therapy and each of the four new regimens that were found to be noninferior in the modified intention-to-treat population was as follows: BCLLfxZ, 9.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 18.7); BLMZ, 8.3 percentage points (95% CI, -0.8 to 17.4); BDLLfxZ, 4.6 percentage points (95% CI, -4.9 to 14.1); and DCMZ, 2.5 percentage points (95% CI, -7.5 to 12.5). Differences were similar in the per-protocol population, with the exception of DCMZ, which was not noninferior in that population.

Child & adolescent health,"There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population.
We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230).
1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success.
Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

It is a treatable disease; however, conventional treatment requires a lengthy treatment regimen with severe side effects, resulting in poor compliance among TB patients. Intermittent drug use, the non-compliance of patients, and prescription errors, among other factors, have led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB, while the mismanagement of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has eventually led to the development of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Thus, there is an urgent need for new drug development, but due to the enormous expenses and time required (up to 20 years) for new drug research and development, new therapeutic approaches to TB are required. Host-directed therapies (HDT) could be a most attractive strategy, as they target the host defense processes instead of the microbe and thereby may prevent the alarming rise of MDR- and XDR-TB. This paper reviews the progress in HDT for the treatment of TB using repurposed drugs which have been investigated in clinical trials (completed or ongoing) and plant-derived natural products that are in clinical or preclinical trial stages.

Low concentrations of ethambutol have been reported in patients dosed with the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended first-line regimen. We analyzed the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol in 61 HIV-positive individuals diagnosed with drug-sensitive TB enrolled in the tuberculosis and highly active antiretroviral therapy (TB-HAART) study. Participants started on TB treatment and were randomized to early or later introduction of efavirenz-based antiretroviral treatment. We explored potential covariate effects and evaluated the current WHO dosing recommendations for ethambutol in drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. A two-compartment model with first-order elimination allometrically scaled by fat-free mass and transit compartment absorption best described the pharmacokinetics of ethambutol. Clearance was estimated to be 40.3 L/h for a typical individual with a fat-free mass (FFM) of 42 kg. The Antib-4 formulation had 26% higher bioavailability and slower mean transit time by 37% compared with Rifafour. Simulations showed that individuals in the lower weight bands (<55 kg) who were administered ethambutol at WHO-recommended doses had relatively low drug exposures.

Two recently published randomized trials that did not achieve statistical significance provide the opportunity for a meta-analysis.
We conducted combined analyses of two phase 3 trials of levofloxacin MDR-TB preventive treatment - Levofloxacin for the Prevention of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (VQUIN) trial and the Levofloxacin preventive treatment in children exposed to MDR-TB (TB-CHAMP) trial. Following MDR-TB household exposure, VQUIN enrolled mainly adults in Vietnam; TB-CHAMP enrolled mainly young children in South Africa. Random assignment in both trials was 1:1 at the household level to daily levofloxacin or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was incident TB by 54 weeks. We estimated the treatment effect overall using individual participant data meta-analysis.
The VQUIN trial (n=2041) randomly assigned 1023 participants to levofloxacin and 1018 participants to placebo; TB-CHAMP (n=922) assigned 453 participants to levofloxacin and 469 participants to placebo.

In this community-based, multisite, double-blind, cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, we assessed the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin as preventive treatment in children with household exposure to an adult with bacteriologically confirmed MDR pulmonary tuberculosis. Children younger than 5 years of age were eligible for inclusion regardless of interferon-γ release assay result or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, and children 5 to 17 years of age were eligible if they had a positive interferon-γ release assay or HIV infection. Households were randomly assigned to a trial regimen, and children in the household received levofloxacin or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was incident tuberculosis, which included death from tuberculosis, by week 48 after randomization. The primary safety end point was any adverse event of grade 3 or higher during the treatment period that was at least possibly related to the trial regimen.

39672603,Tuberculosis in adult migrants in Europe: a TBnet consensus statement.,,The European respiratory journal,"Global migration has increased in recent decades owing to war, conflict, persecution and natural disasters, but also secondary to increased opportunities related to work or study. Migrants' risk of tuberculosis (TB) differs depending on migration, socioeconomic status, mode of travel and TB risk in transit, TB incidence and healthcare provision in country of origin. Despite advances in TB care for migrants and new treatment strategies, decisions for managing migrants at risk of TB often rely on expert opinions, rather than clinical evidence.
A systematic literature search was conducted, studies were mapped to different recommendation groups and included studies were synthesised by meta-analysis where appropriate. Current evidence on the diagnosis of active TB in migrants entering the European Union/European Economic Area and UK, including clinical presentation and diagnostic delay, treatment outcomes of drug-susceptible TB, prevalence, and treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant TB and TB/HIV co-infection, was summarised. A consensus process was used based on the evidence.
We documented that migrants had higher vulnerability for TB, including an increased risk of extrapulmonary TB, multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant TB, TB/HIV co-infection and worse TB treatment outcomes compared to host populations. Consensus recommendations include screening migrants for TB/latent TB infection according to country data, a minimal package for TB care in drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant TB, implementation of migrant-sensitive strategies and free healthcare and preventive treatment for migrants with HIV co-infection.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 10, 2023, for trials that had greater than or equal to 50 participants per arm and had follow-up to at least treatment completion. Studies were excluded if they compared different formulations of standard drugs (eg, fixed-dose combination tablets); aimed to primarily enrol participants with isoniazid-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis; evaluated treatment to prevent tuberculosis infection; tested dietary or vitamin supplementation; tested vaccines or other immune-based interventions; tested adherence support or system-related mechanisms; or enrolled participants with tuberculosis, but tuberculosis treatment itself was not randomised (ie, trials of the timing of antiretroviral therapy initiation). Trial protocols and trials not available in English were also excluded. The outcomes were inclusion and exclusion criteria, characteristics of participants, and adverse event reporting. This systematic review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO ID CRD42022373954). We identified 7328 articles, of which 40 were eligible for analysis. Demographic characteristics, including sex, were reported for 20 420 participants, of which 6663 (33%) were female and 13 757 (67%) were male. We found that people who were greatly affected by the global tuberculosis pandemic were frequently excluded from participation: of the 40 trials, 25 (62·5%) excluded people younger than 18 years, 12 (30·0%) excluded people aged 65 years or older, 34 (85·0%) excluded pregnant or lactating people, 12 (30·0%) excluded people with diabetes, and 11 (27·5%) excluded people with excessive alcohol use, drug use, or both. In the nine trials that reported enrolment of people with diabetes, the pooled proportion of participants with diabetes (9%) was lower than global estimates for the proportion of people with tuberculosis who have diabetes (16%). There were important gaps in adverse event ascertainment, analysis, and interpretation. Of the 40 trials, a minority reported measures of regimen acceptability: 14 (35·0%) reported study withdrawal, eight (20·0%) reported temporary and 16 (40·0%) reported permanent discontinuation of assigned therapy, and 11 (27·5%) reported adherence. Participants in trials were not representative of the global tuberculosis pandemic in demographic and clinical characteristics, restricting the generalisability of trial outcomes.

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Center for Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, US Food and Drug Administration, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry for primary articles published from 2013 to July 2023. Favorable (cured and treatment completed) and unfavorable (treatment failure, death, loss to follow-up, and culture conversion) outcomes were assessed as the main efficacy outcomes, while adverse events were assessed as the safety outcomes. The network meta-analysis was performed using R Studio version 4.3.1 and the Netmeta package. The study protocol adhered to the PRISMA-NMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023434050).
We included 11 eligible studies (4 randomized control trials and 7 cohorts) that enrolled 3,548 patients with MDR/RR-TB. Treatment with a 6-month combination of BdqLzdLfxZTrd/Eto/H had two times more favorable outcomes [RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.22, 4.13), P = 0.0094], followed by a 9-11 month combination of km/CmMfx/LfxPtoCfzZEHh [RR1.67 (95% CI 1.45, 1.92), P < 0.001] and a 6-month BdqPaLzdMfx [RR 1.64 (95% CI 1.24, 2.16), P < 0.0005] compared to the standard longer regimens. Treatment with 6 months of BdqPaLzdMfx [RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.2, 0.55), P < 0.0001] had a low risk of severe adverse events, followed by 6 months of BdqPaLzd [RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.22, 0.59), P ≤ 0.001] and BdqPaLzdCfz [RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.37, 0.80), P < 0.0001] than standard of care.
Treatment of patients with RR/MDR-TB using shorter regimens of 6 months BdqLzdLfxZTrd/Eto/H, 9-11 months km/CmMfx/LfxPtoCfzZEHh, and 6 months BdqPaLzdMfx provides significantly higher cure and treatment completion rates compared to the standard longer MDR/RR-TB.

We evaluated hepatotoxicity in two novel regimens against the standard shorter regimen recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Participants from the TB-TRUST and TB-TRUST plus trials were assigned to the WHO shorter regimen, a levofloxacin (Lfx)-based regimen, or a bedaquiline (Bdq)-based regimen. Liver function was tested bi-weekly in the first month, then monthly until treatment ended. Eligibility required receiving at least one drug dose and undergoing at least two liver function tests.
Of 429 patients, hepatotoxicity was most prevalent in the WHO shorter group (26.7% of 169), compared to 4.7% in the Lfx group (172 patients), and 5.7% in the Bdq group (88 patients).

39219765,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis treatments, the case for a phase III platform trial.",,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"Most phase III trials in drug-resistant tuberculosis have either been underpowered to quantify differences in microbiological endpoints or have taken up to a decade to complete. Composite primary endpoints, dominated by differences in treatment discontinuation and regimen changes, may mask important differences in treatment failure and relapse. Although new regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis appear very effective, resistance to new drugs is emerging rapidly. There is a need for shorter, safer and more tolerable regimens, including those active against bedaquiline-resistant tuberculosis. Transitioning from multiple regimen A versus regimen B trials to a single large phase III platform trial would accelerate the acquisition of robust estimates of relative efficacy and safety. Further efficiencies could be achieved by adopting modern adaptive platform designs. Collaboration among trialists, affected community representatives, funders and regulators is essential for developing such a phase III platform trial for drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens.
La majorité des essais de phase III relatifs à la tuberculose pharmacorésistante soit n'étaient pas assez puissants pour quantifier les fluctuations au niveau des critères microbiologiques, soit étaient trop longs, se poursuivant parfois pendant dix ans. Les critères primaires composites, dominés par des différences dans l'interruption du traitement et les changements de schéma, pourraient dissimuler d'importantes variations en termes d'échec thérapeutique et de rechute. Bien que les nouveaux traitements contre la tuberculose pharmacorésistante semblent très efficaces, la résistance aux nouveaux médicaments évolue rapidement. Il est donc nécessaire d'opter pour des traitements plus courts, plus sûrs et mieux tolérés, y compris ceux actifs contre la tuberculose résistant à la bédaquiline. Délaisser la multitude d'essais opposant un schéma de traitement A à un schéma de traitement B pour se diriger vers un unique essai plateforme de phase III de grande envergure permettrait d'obtenir plus vite des estimations solides concernant l'innocuité et l'efficacité relative. En outre, adopter des modèles de plateforme modernes et adaptatifs contribuerait à de meilleures performances. Enfin, la collaboration entre investigateurs, représentants des communautés concernées, bailleurs de fonds et organismes de réglementation est essentielle à l'élaboration de ce type d'essai plateforme de phase III sur les traitements contre la tuberculose pharmacorésistante.

39177079,Diabetes as a risk factor for tuberculosis disease.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Tuberculosis (TB) is amongst the leading causes of death from an infectious disease, with an estimated 1.3 million deaths from TB in 2022. Approximately 25% of the global population is estimated to be infected with the TB bacterium, giving rise to 10.6 million episodes of TB disease in 2022. The prevalence of diabetes influences TB incidence and TB mortality. It is associated not only with an increased risk of TB disease but also death during TB treatment, TB relapse after treatment completion and multidrug-resistant TB. Since 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended collaborative TB and diabetes activities as outlined in the Collaborative Framework for Care and Control of TB and Diabetes.
To determine the prognostic value of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the general population of adults, adolescents and children for predicting tuberculosis disease.
We searched the literature databases MEDLINE (via PubMed) and WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 3 May 2023 (date of last search for all databases); we placed no restrictions on the language of publication.
We included retrospective and prospective cohort studies, irrespective of publication status or language. The target population comprised adults, adolescents and children from diverse settings, encompassing outpatient and inpatient cohorts, with varying comorbidities and risk of exposure to tuberculosis.
We used standard Cochrane methodology and the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Prognostic factors assessed at enrolment/baseline included diabetes, as defined by the individual studies, encompassing patient-reported status, abstracted from medical records or claims data, or diagnosed by plasma glucose/glycosylated haemoglobin. The primary outcome was the incidence of tuberculosis disease. The secondary outcome was recurrent TB disease. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis for the adjusted hazard ratios, risk ratios, or odds ratios, employing the restricted maximum likelihood estimation. We rated the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
We included 48 cohort studies with over 61 million participants from the six WHO regions. However, the representation was variable as eight population-based studies were from South Korea and 19 from China, with overlapping study periods, and only one from the African region (Ethiopia). All studies included adults, and nine studies also included children and adolescents. Most studies diagnosed DM based on clinical records, including fasting blood glucose levels or glucose-lowering treatments. The studies did not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 DM; only one study focused on type 1 DM. Diagnosis and exclusion of TB were performed using culture or molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests (mWRD) in only 12 studies, which could have biassed the effect estimate. The median follow-up time was five years (interquartile range 1.5 to 10, range 1 to 16.9), and the studies primarily reported an adjusted hazard ratio from a multivariable Cox-proportional hazard model. Hazard Ratios (HR) The HR estimates represent the highest certainty of the evidence, explored through sensitivity analyses and excluding studies at high risk of bias. We present 95% confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals, which show between-study heterogeneity represented in measuring the variability of effect sizes (i.e. the interval within which the effect size of a new study would fall considering the same population of studies included in the meta-analysis). DM may increase the risk of tuberculosis disease (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.40; prediction interval 0.83 to 4.39; 10 studies; 11,713,023 participants). The certainty of the evidence is low, due to a moderate risk of bias across studies and inconsistency. Considering a risk without diabetes of 129 cases per 100,000 population, this represents 102 more (59 to 153 more) cases per 100,000. When stratified by follow-up time, the results are more consistent across < 10 years follow-up (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.57; prediction interval 1.45 to 1.59; 7 studies; 10,380,872 participants). This results in a moderate certainty of the evidence due to a moderate risk of bias across studies. However, at 10 or more years of follow-up, the estimates yield a wider CI and a higher HR (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.88; prediction interval 0.09 to 69.12; 3 studies; 1,332,151 participants). The certainty of the evidence is low due to the moderate risk of bias and inconsistency. Odds Ratio (OR) DM may increase the odds of tuberculosis disease (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.04; prediction interval 0.96 to 2.70; 4 studies; 167,564 participants). Stratification by follow-up time was not possible as all studies had a follow-up < 10 years. The certainty of the evidence is low due to a moderate risk of bias and inconsistency. Risk Ratio (RR) The RR estimates represent the highest certainty of the evidence, explored through sensitivity analyses and excluding studies at high risk of bias. DM probably increases the risk of tuberculosis disease (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.80; prediction interval 1.38 to 1.85; 6 studies; 44,058,675 participants). Stratification by follow-up time was not possible as all studies had a follow-up < 10 years. The certainty of the evidence is moderate due to a moderate risk of bias.
Diabetes probably increases the risk of developing TB disease in the short term (< 10 years) and may also increase the risk in the long term (≥ 10 years). As glycaemic control and access to care may be potential effect modifiers of the association between diabetes and the risk of TB disease, the overall estimates should be interpreted with caution when applied locally. Policies targeted at reducing the burden of diabetes are needed to contribute to the aims of ending TB. Large population-based cohorts, including those derived from high-quality national registries of exposures (diabetes) and outcomes (TB disease), are needed to provide estimates with a high certainty of evidence of this risk across different settings and populations, including low- and middle-income countries from different WHO regions. Moreover, studies including children and adolescents and currently recommended methods for diagnosing TB would provide more up-to-date information relevant to practice and policy.

We utilized WGS to investigate drug resistance mutations in a 32-year-old Tanzanian male admitted to Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital with a history of interrupted multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment for more than three years. Before admission, he received various all-oral bedaquiline-based multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens with unfavourable outcomes.
Drug susceptibility testing of serial M. tuberculosis isolates using Mycobacterium Growth Incubator Tubes culture and WGS revealed resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs, bedaquiline, and fluoroquinolones but susceptibility to linezolid, clofazimine, and delamanid. WGS of serial cultured isolates revealed that the Beijing (Lineage 2.2.2) strain was resistant to bedaquiline, with mutations in the mmpR5 gene (Rv0678. This study also revealed the emergence of two distinct subpopulations of bedaquiline-resistant tuberculosis strains with Asp47f and Glu49fs frameshift mutations in the mmpR5 gene, which might be the underlying cause of prolonged resistance.

To inform treatment duration in clinical trials, this study aimed to identify human pharmacokinetic equivalent doses, antimycobacterial and sterilizing activity of a novel regimen, containing bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin and sutezolid (BDMU), in the standard mouse model (BALB/c) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection.
Treatment of mice with B25D0.6M200U200, B25D0.6M200, B25D0.6M200(U2003) or H10R10Z150E100 (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, HRZE), started 3 weeks after Mtb infection. Bactericidal activity was assessed after 1, 2, 3 and 4 months of treatment and relapse rates were assessed 3 months after completing treatment durations of 2, 3 and 4 months.
B25D0.6M200U200 generated human equivalent exposures in uninfected BALB/c mice. After 1 month of treatment, a higher bactericidal activity was observed for the B25D0.6M200U200 and the B25D0.6M200 regimen compared to the standard H10R10Z150E100 regimen. Furthermore, 3 months of therapy with both BDM-based regimens resulted in negative lung cultures, whereas all H10R10Z150E100 treated mice were still culture positive. After 3 months of therapy 7% and 13% of mice relapsed receiving B25D0.6M200U200 and B25D0.6M200, respectively, compared to 40% for H10R10Z150E100 treatment showing an increased sterilizing activity of both BDM-based regimens.
BDM-based regimens, with and without sutezolid, have a higher efficacy than the HRZE regimen in the BALB/c model of TB, with some improvement by adding sutezolid.

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed target regimen profiles for the treatment of tuberculosis to make drug developers aware of both the important features of treatment regimens, and patient and programmatic needs at the country level. In view of recent ground-breaking advances in tuberculosis treatment, WHO has revised and updated these regimen profiles. We used a similar process as for the 2016 profiles, including a baseline treatment landscape analysis, an initial stakeholder survey, modelling studies estimating the impact and cost-effectiveness of novel tuberculosis treatment regimens, and an extensive stakeholder consultation. We developed target regimen profiles for the treatment of rifampicin-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, as well as a pan-tuberculosis regimen that would be appropriate for patients with any type of tuberculosis. We describe the revised target regimen profile characteristics, with specific minimal and optimal targets to be met, rationale and justification, and aspects relevant to all target regimen profiles (drug susceptibility testing, adherence and forgiveness, treatment strategies, post-tuberculosis lung disease, and cost and access considerations). We discuss the trade-offs of proposed characteristics for decision-making at developmental or operational levels. We expect that, following these target regimen profile revisions, tuberculosis treatment developers will produce regimens that are quality-assured, affordable and widely available, and that meet the needs of affected populations.

Nous discutons des compromis des caractéristiques proposées pour la prise de décisions au niveau du développement ou au niveau opérationnel. Nous espérons qu’à la suite de ces révisions du profil de schéma thérapeutique cible, les concepteurs de traitements antituberculeux produiront des schémas dont la qualité est assurée, qui sont abordables et largement disponibles et qui répondent aux besoins des populations touchées.

Accurate cost estimations across the spectrum of paediatric RR-TB treatment regimens are critical inputs for prioritisation and budgeting decisions, and an existing knowledge gap at local and international levels. This normative cost analysis was nested in a Phase I/II pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and acceptability trial of TB medications in children in South Africa, the Philippines and India. It assessed the pharmaceutical costs of 36 childhood RR-TB regimens using combinations from 16 different medicines in 34 oral formulations (adult and child-friendly) in 11 weight bands in children <15 years of age. The analysis used local and Global Drug Facility pricing, and local and international guideline recommendations, including adaptions of BPaL and BPaLM regimens in adults. Costs varied significantly between regimen length, age/weight banding, severity of disease, presence of fluroquinolone resistance, and different country guideline recommendations. WHO recommended regimen costs ranged 12-fold: from US$232 per course (short regimen in non-severe disease) to US$2,761 (long regimen in severe, fluroquinolone-resistant disease). Regimen treating fluoroquinolone-resistant infection cost US$1,090 more than comparable WHO-recommended regimen. Providing child-friendly medicine formulations in <5-year-olds across all WHO-recommended regimens is expected to cost an additional $380 (range $212-$563) per child but is expected to have wider benefits including palatability, acceptability, adherence, tolerability, and dose accuracy. There were substantial differences in regimen affordability between countries when adjusted for purchasing power and domestic spending on health. Appropriate, effective, and affordable treatment options are an important component of the fight against childhood RR-TB. A comprehensive understanding of the cost and affordability dynamics of treatment options will enable national TB programs and global collaborations to make the best use of limited healthcare resources for the care of children with RR-TB.",,,,2024-07-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
39016594,Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of tuberculosis time to positivity and colony-forming unit to assess the response to dose-ranging linezolid.,"colony-forming unit, early bactericidal activity, time-to-positivity, tuberculosis",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"According to the World Health Organization, the number of tuberculosis (TB) infections and the drug-resistant burden worldwide increased by 4.5% and 3.0%, respectively, between 2020 and 2021. Disease severity and complexity drive the interest for undertaking new clinical trials to provide efficient treatment to limit spread and drug resistance. TB Alliance conducted a phase 2 study in 106 patients to guide linezolid (LZD) dose selection using early bactericidal activity over 14 days of treatment. LZD is highly efficient for drug-resistant TB treatment, but treatment monitoring is required since serious adverse events can occur. The objective of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model to analyze the dose-response relationship between linezolid exposure and efficacy biomarkers. Using time to positivity (TTP) and colony-forming unit (CFU) count data, we developed a PKPD model in six dosing regimens, differing on LZD dosing intensity.

It is important to understand how pregnancy PV projects operate in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where there is a disproportionate lack of PV data yet a high burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a scoping review to assess how exposures and outcomes were measured in recently published pregnancy PV projects in LMICs.
We utilized a search string, secondary review, and team knowledge to review publications focusing on therapeutic or vaccine exposures among pregnant people in LMICs. We screened abstracts for relevance before conducting a full text review, and documented measurements of exposures and outcomes (categorized as maternal, birth, or neonatal/infant) among other factors, including study topic, setting, and design, comparator groups, and funding sources.
We identified 31 PV publications spanning at least 24 LMICs, all focusing on therapeutics or vaccines for infectious diseases, including HIV (n = 17), tuberculosis (TB; n = 9), malaria (n = 7), pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria (n = 1), and influenza (n = 3). As for outcomes, n = 15, n = 31, and n = 20 of the publications covered maternal, birth, and neonatal/infant outcomes, respectively. Among HIV-specific publications, the primary exposure-outcome relationship of focus was exposure to maternal antiretroviral therapy and adverse outcomes. For TB-specific publications, the main exposures of interest were second-line drug-resistant TB and isoniazid-based prevention therapeutics for pregnant people living with HIV. For malaria-specific publications, the primary exposure-outcome relationship of interest was antimalarial medication exposure during pregnancy and adverse outcomes. Among vaccine-focused publications, the exposure was assessed during a specific time during pregnancy, with an overall interest in vaccine safety and/or efficacy. The study settings were frequently from Africa, designs varied from cohort or cross-sectional studies to clinical trials, and funding sources were largely from high-income countries.
The published pregnancy PV projects were largely centered in Africa and concerned with infectious diseases. This may reflect the disease burden in LMICs but also funding priorities from high-income countries. As the prevalence of non-communicable diseases increases in LMICs, PV projects will have to broaden their scope. Birth and neonatal/infant outcomes were most reported, with fewer reporting on maternal outcomes and none on longer-term child outcomes; additionally, heterogeneity existed in definitions and ascertainment of specific measures. Notably, almost all projects covered a single therapeutic exposure, missing an opportunity to leverage their projects to cover additional exposures, add scientific rigor, create uniformity across health services, and bolster existing health systems. For many publications, the timing of exposure, specifically by trimester, was crucial to maternal and neonatal safety.

This study aims to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) in improving depressive symptoms in people with TB and comorbid depression, enhancing adherence with anti-TB treatment (ATT) and its implementation in the real-world setting of Pakistan.
We will conduct a pragmatic parallel arm randomised control trial with an internal pilot. A brief psychological intervention based on CBT has been developed using a combination of qualitative and ethnographic studies. The inbuilt pilot trial will have a sample size of 80, while we plan to recruit 560 (280 per arm) participants in the definitive trial. Participants who started on ATT within 1 month of diagnosis for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB or multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and meeting the criteria for depression on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be randomised with 1:1 allocation to receive six sessions of CBT (delivered by TB healthcare workers) or ETAU. Data on the feasibility outcomes of the pilot will be considered to proceed with the definitive trial. Participants will be assessed (by a blinded assessor) for the following main trial primary outcomes: (1) severity of depression using PHQ-9 scale (interviewer-administered questionnaire) at baseline, weeks 8, 24 and 32 postrandomisation and (2) ATT at baseline and week 24 at the end of ATT therapy.

Infectious diseases,"Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) can rapidly and simultaneously detect mutations associated with resistance to tuberculosis drugs across multiple gene targets. The use of targeted NGS to diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis, as described in publicly available data, has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to identify targeted NGS assays that diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis, determine how widely this technology has been used, and assess the diagnostic accuracy of these assays.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, Global Index Medicus, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for published and unpublished reports on targeted NGS for drug-resistant tuberculosis from Jan 1, 2005, to Oct 14, 2022, with updates to our search in Embase and Google Scholar until Feb 13, 2024. Studies eligible for the systematic review described targeted NGS approaches to predict drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections using primary samples, reference strain collections, or cultured isolates from individuals with presumed or confirmed tuberculosis. Our search had no limitations on study type or language, although only reports in English, German, and French were screened for eligibility. For the meta-analysis, we included test accuracy studies that used any reference standard, and we assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. The primary outcomes for the meta-analysis were sensitivity and specificity of targeted NGS to diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis compared to phenotypic and genotypic drug susceptibility testing. We used a Bayesian bivariate model to generate summary receiver operating characteristic plots and diagnostic accuracy measures, overall and stratified by drug and sample type. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022368707.
We identified and screened 2920 reports, of which 124 were eligible for our systematic review, including 37 review articles and 87 reports of studies collecting samples for targeted NGS. Sequencing was mainly done in the USA (14 [16%] of 87), western Europe (ten [11%]), India (ten [11%]), and China (nine [10%]). We included 24 test accuracy studies in the meta-analysis, in which 23 different tuberculosis drugs or drug groups were assessed, covering first-line drugs, injectable drugs, and fluoroquinolones and predominantly comparing targeted NGS with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. The combined sensitivity of targeted NGS across all drugs was 94·1% (95% credible interval [CrI] 90·9-96·3) and specificity was 98·1% (97·0-98·9). Sensitivity for individual drugs ranged from 76·5% (52·5-92·3) for capreomycin to 99·1% (98·3-99·7) for rifampicin; specificity ranged from 93·1% (88·0-96·3) for ethambutol to 99·4% (98·3-99·8) for amikacin. Diagnostic accuracy was similar for primary clinical samples and culture isolates overall and for rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, and fluoroquinolones, and similar after excluding studies at high risk of bias (overall sensitivity 95·2% [95% CrI 91·7-97·1] and specificity 98·6% [97·4-99·3]).
Targeted NGS is highly sensitive and specific for detecting drug resistance across panels of tuberculosis drugs and can be performed directly on clinical samples. There is a paucity of data on performance for some currently recommended drugs. The barriers preventing the use of targeted NGS to diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis in high-burden countries need to be addressed.

Infectious diseases,"The current tuberculosis (TB) drug development pipeline is being re-populated with candidates, including nitroimidazoles such as pretomanid, that exhibit a potential to shorten TB therapy by exerting a bactericidal effect on non-replicating bacilli. Based on results from preclinical and early clinical studies, a four-drug combination of bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide (BPaMZ) regimen was identified with treatment-shortening potential for both drug-susceptible (DS) and drug-resistant (DR) TB. This trial aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of BPaMZ. We compared 4 months of BPaMZ to the standard 6 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) in DS-TB. 6 months of BPaMZ was assessed in DR-TB.
SimpliciTB was a partially randomised, phase 2c, open-label, clinical trial, recruiting participants at 26 sites in eight countries. Participants aged 18 years or older with pulmonary TB who were sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli were eligible for enrolment. Participants with DS-TB had Mycobacterium tuberculosis with sensitivity to rifampicin and isoniazid. Participants with DR-TB had M tuberculosis with resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, or both. Participants with DS-TB were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by HIV status and cavitation on chest radiograph, using balanced block randomisation with a fixed block size of four. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to sputum culture-negative status by 8 weeks; the key secondary endpoint was unfavourable outcome at week 52. A non-inferiority margin of 12% was chosen for the key secondary outcome. Safety and tolerability outcomes are presented as descriptive analyses. The efficacy analysis population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication and who had efficacy data available and had no major protocol violations. The safety population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03338621) and is completed.
Between July 30, 2018, and March 2, 2020, 455 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. 324 (71%) participants were male and 131 (29%) participants were female. 303 participants with DS-TB were randomly assigned to 4 months of BPaMZ (n=150) or HRZE (n=153). In a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis, by week 8, 122 (84%) of 145 and 70 (47%) of 148 participants were culture-negative on 4 months of BPaMZ and HRZE, respectively, with a hazard ratio for earlier negative status of 2·93 (95% CI 2·17-3·96; p<0·0001). Median time to negative culture (TTN) was 6 weeks (IQR 4-8) on 4 months of BPaMZ and 11 weeks (6-12) on HRZE. 86% of participants with DR-TB receiving 6 months of BPaMZ (n=152) reached culture-negative status by week 8, with a median TTN of 5 weeks (IQR 3-7). At week 52, 120 (83%) of 144, 134 (93%) of 144, and 111 (83%) of 133 on 4 months of BPaMZ, HRZE, and 6 months of BPaMZ had favourable outcomes, respectively. Despite bacteriological efficacy, 4 months of BPaMZ did not meet the non-inferiority margin for the key secondary endpoint in the pre-defined mITT population due to higher withdrawal rates for adverse hepatic events. Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the per-protocol population confirming the effect of withdrawals with 4 months of BPaMZ. At least one liver-related treatment-emergent adverse effect (TEAE) occurred among 45 (30%) participants on 4 months of BPaMZ, 38 (25%) on HRZE, and 33 (22%) on 6 months of BPaMZ. Serious liver-related TEAEs were reported by 20 participants overall; 11 (7%) among those on 4 months of BPaMZ, one (1%) on HRZE, and eight (5%) on 6 months of BPaMZ. The most common reasons for discontinuation of trial treatment were hepatotoxicity (ten participants [2%]), increased hepatic enzymes (nine participants [2%]), QTcF prolongation (three participants [1%]), and hypersensitivity (two participants [<1%]).
For DS-TB, BPaMZ successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint of sputum culture conversion. The regimen did not meet the key secondary efficacy endpoint due to adverse events resulting in treatment withdrawal. Our study demonstrated the potential for treatment-shortening efficacy of the BPaMZ regimen for DS-TB and DR-TB, providing clinical validation of a murine model widely used to identify such regimens. It also highlights that novel, treatment-shortening TB treatment regimens require an acceptable toxicity and tolerability profile with minimal monitoring in low-resource and high-burden settings. The increased risk of unpredictable severe hepatic adverse events with 4 months of BPaMZ would be a considerable obstacle to implementation of this regimen in settings with high burdens of TB with limited infrastructure for close surveillance of liver biochemistry. Future research should focus on improving the preclinical and early clinical detection and mitigation of safety issues together and further efforts to optimise shorter treatments.

This phase 4, randomized, open-label, controlled, non-inferiority trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a 9-month all-oral SCR containing bedaquiline (BDQ) versus an all-oral SCR without BDQ for adult MDR-TB patients (18-65 years) in China. The trial design mainly mirrors that of the ""Evaluation of a Standardized Treatment Regimen of Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs for Patients with MDR-TB"" (STREAM) stage 2 study, while also incorporating programmatic data from South Africa and the 2019 consensus recommendations of Chinese MDR/RR-TB treatment experts. Experimental arm participants will receive a modified STREAM regimen C that replaces three group C drugs, ethambutol (EMB), pyrazinamide (PZA), and prothionamide (PTO), with two group B drugs, linezolid (LZD) and cycloserine (CS), while omitting high-dose isoniazid (INH) for confirmed INH-resistant cases. BDQ duration will be extended from 6 to 9 months for participants with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-positive sputum cultures at week 16. The control arm will receive a modified STREAM regimen B without high-dose INH and injectable kanamycin (KM) that incorporates experimental arm LZD and CS dosages, treatment durations, and administration methods. LZD (600 mg) will be given daily for ≥ 24 weeks as guided by observed benefits and harm. The primary outcome measures the proportion of participants with favorable treatment outcomes at treatment completion (week 40), while the same measurement taken at 48 weeks post-treatment completion is the secondary outcome. Assuming an α = 0.025 significance level (one-sided test), 80% power, 15% non-inferiority margin, and 10% lost to follow-up rate, each arm requires 106 participants (212 total) to demonstrate non-inferiority.
PROSPECT aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a BDQ-containing SCR MDR-TB treatment at seventeen sites across China, while also providing high-quality data to guide SCRs administration under the direction of the China National Tuberculosis Program for MDR-TB. Additionally, PROSPECT will explore the potential benefits of extending the administration of the 9-month BDQ-containing SCR for participants without sputum conversion by week 16.

Herein, we reported the updated data on overall survival (OS) and molecular profiling from the initial phase II study.
In this study, 180 patients received 225 mg of ensartinib orally once daily until disease progression, death or withdrawal. OS was estimated by Kaplan‒Meier methods with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Next-generation sequencing was employed to explore prognostic biomarkers based on plasma samples collected at baseline and after initiating ensartinib. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was detected to dynamically monitor the genomic alternations during treatment and indicate the existence of molecular residual disease, facilitating improvement of clinical management.
At the data cut-off date (August 31, 2022), with a median follow-up time of 53.2 months, 97 of 180 (53.9%) patients had died. The median OS was 42.8 months (95% CI: 29.3-53.2 months). A total of 333 plasma samples from 168 patients were included for ctDNA analysis. An inferior OS correlated significantly with baseline ALK or tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation. In addition, patients with concurrent TP53 mutations had shorter OS than those without concurrent TP53 mutations. High ctDNA levels evaluated by variant allele frequency (VAF) and haploid genome equivalents per milliliter of plasma (hGE/mL) at baseline were associated with poor OS. Additionally, patients with ctDNA clearance at 6 weeks and slow ascent growth had dramatically longer OS than those with ctDNA residual and fast ascent growth, respectively. Furthermore, patients who had a lower tumor burden, as evaluated by the diameter of target lesions, had a longer OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis further uncovered the independent prognostic values of bone metastases, higher hGE, and elevated ALK mutation abundance at 6 weeks.

However, treatment-limiting toxicities of linezolid and reports of emerging bedaquiline and pretomanid resistance necessitate efforts to develop new short-course oral regimens. We recently found that the addition of GSK2556286 increases the bactericidal and sterilizing activity of BPa-containing regimens in a well-established BALB/c mouse model of tuberculosis. Here, we used this model to evaluate the potential of new regimens combining bedaquiline or the more potent diarylquinoline TBAJ-587 with GSK2556286 and the DprE1 inhibitor TBA-7371, all of which are currently in early-phase clinical trials. We found the combination of bedaquiline, GSK2556286, and TBA-7371 to be more active than the first-line regimen and nearly as effective as BPaL in terms of bactericidal and sterilizing activity. In addition, we found that GSK2556286 and TBA-7371 were as effective as pretomanid and the novel oxazolidinone TBI-223 when either drug pair was combined with TBAJ-587 and that the addition of GSK2556286 increased the bactericidal activity of the TBAJ-587, pretomanid, and TBI-223 combination.

We assess the association between HIV infection and radiographic manifestations of tuberculosis and factors associated with time to culture conversion in Stage 1 of the STREAM trial.
Reading of chest radiographs was undertaken independently by two clinicians, and films with discordant reading were read by a third reader. Recording of abnormal opacity of the lung parenchyma included location (right upper, right lower, left upper, and left lower) and extent of disease (minimal, moderately-advanced, and far advanced). Time to culture conversion was defined as the number of days from initiation of treatment to the first of two consecutive negative culture results, and compared using the log-rank test, stratified by country. Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by country and adjusted for HIV status, were used to identify factors associated with culture conversion.
Of the 364 participants, all but one had an abnormal chest X-ray: 347 (95%) had opacities over upper lung fields, 318 (87%) had opacities over lower lung fields, 124 (34%) had far advanced pulmonary involvement, and 281 (77%) had cavitation. There was no significant association between HIV and locations of lung parenchymal opacities, extent of opacities, the presence of cavitation, and location of cavitation. Participants infected with HIV were significantly less likely to have the highest positivity grade (3+) of sputum culture (p = 0.035) as compared to participants not infected with HIV. Cavitation was significantly associated with high smear positivity grades (p < 0.001) and high culture positivity grades (p = 0.004) among all participants. Co-infection with HIV was associated with a shorter time to culture conversion (hazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.05-2.40).
Radiographic manifestations of tuberculosis among the HIV-infected in the era of anti-retroviral therapy may not differ from that among those who were not infected with HIV. Radiographic manifestations were not consistently associated with time to culture conversion, perhaps indicating that the Short regimen is sufficiently powerful in achieving sputum conversion across the spectrum of radiographic pulmonary involvements.

QBS's potent bactericidal activity and distinct mechanism of action (compared with other TB drugs currently available for human use) may make it an ideal candidate for inclusion in a novel treatment regimen to improve efficacy and potentially prevent resistance to concomitant TB drugs. This trial will assess the effectiveness, safety, and dosing of a new, shorter, QBS-based, combination anti-TB treatment regimen.

This economic evaluation seeks to quantify the cost-effectiveness of this mHealth intervention from a healthcare provider and societal perspective.
The V-SMART trial will recruit 902 patients treated for MDR-TB across seven participating provinces in Vietnam. Participants in both intervention and control groups will receive standard community-based therapy for MDR-TB. Participants in the intervention group will also have a purpose-designed App installed on their smartphones to report AEs to health workers and to facilitate timely management of AEs. This economic evaluation will compare the costs and health outcomes between the intervention group (mHealth) and the control group (standard of care). Costs associated with delivering the intervention and health service utilisation will be recorded, as well as patient out-of-pocket costs. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of study participants will be captured using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be based on the primary outcome (proportion of patients with treatment success after 24 months) and QALYs gained. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to test the robustness of the ICERs. A budget impact analysis will be conducted from a payer perspective to provide an estimate of the total budget required to scale-up delivery of the intervention.

Addition of linezolid did not improve the bactericidal activity of the high-dose rifampin-containing regimen in either animal model. Moreover, the addition of linezolid to standard-dose rifampin in mice also did not improve its efficacy.

The newer anti-tuberculosis drugs, bedaquiline and delamanid, and repurposed drugs clofazimine and linezolid, show great promise for combination in shorter, less-toxic, and effective regimens. To date, there has been no randomized, internally and concurrently controlled trial of a shorter, all-oral regimen comprising these newer and repurposed drugs sufficiently powered to produce results for pre-XDR TB patients.
endTB-Q is a phase III, multi-country, randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a treatment strategy for patients with pre-XDR TB. Study participants are randomized 2:1 to experimental or control arms, respectively. The experimental arm contains bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine, and delamanid. The control comprises the contemporaneous WHO standard of care for pre-XDR TB. Experimental arm duration is determined by a composite of smear microscopy and chest radiographic imaging at baseline and re-evaluated at 6 months using sputum culture results: participants with less extensive disease receive 6 months and participants with more extensive disease receive 9 months of treatment. Randomization is stratified by country and by participant extent-of-TB-disease phenotype defined according to screening/baseline characteristics. Study participation lasts up to 104 weeks post randomization. The primary objective is to assess whether the efficacy of experimental regimens at 73 weeks is non-inferior to that of the control. A sample size of 324 participants across 2 arms affords at least 80% power to show the non-inferiority, with a one-sided alpha of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 12%, against the control in both modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations.
This internally controlled study of shortened treatment for pre-XDR TB will provide urgently needed data and evidence for clinical and policy decision-making around the treatment of pre-XDR TB with a four-drug, all-oral, shortened regimen.

However, without advances in adherence support, we may not realize the full potential of these therapeutics. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of adherence support interventions on clinical and biological endpoints using an adaptive randomized platform.
This is a prospective, adaptive, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of four adherence support strategies on a composite clinical outcome in adults with MDR-TB and HIV initiating bedaquiline-containing MDR-TB treatment regimens and receiving ART in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Trial arms include (1) enhanced standard of care, (2) psychosocial support, (3) mHealth using cellular-enabled electronic dose monitoring, and (4) combined mHealth and psychosocial support. The level of support will be titrated using a differentiated service delivery (DSD)-informed assessment of treatment support needs. The composite primary outcome will include survival, negative TB culture, retention in care, and undetectable HIV viral load at month 12. Secondary outcomes will include individual components of the primary outcome and quantitative evaluation of adherence on TB and HIV treatment outcomes.
This trial will evaluate the contribution of different modes of adherence support on MDR-TB and HIV outcomes with WHO-recommended all-oral MDR-TB regimens and ART in a high-burden operational setting. We will also assess the utility of a DSD framework to pragmatically adjust levels of MDR-TB and HIV treatment support.

However, the classic randomized controlled trial (RCT) approach faces ethical and practical constraints, making alternative research designs and treatment strategies necessary, such as single-arm trials and host-directed therapies (HDTs).
Our study adopts a randomized withdrawal trial design for MDR-TB to maximize resource allocation and better mimic real-world conditions. Patients' treatment regimens are initially based on drug resistance profiles and patient's preference, and later, treatment-responsive cases are randomized to different treatment durations. Alongside, a single-arm trial is being conducted to evaluate the potential of sulfasalazine (SASP) as an HDT for pre-XDR-TB, as well as another short-course regimen without HDT for pre-XDR-TB. Both approaches account for the limitations in second-line anti-TB drug resistance testing in various regions.
Although our study designs may lack the internal validity commonly associated with RCTs, they offer advantages in external validity, feasibility, and ethical appropriateness. These designs align with real-world clinical settings and also open doors for exploring alternative treatments like SASP for tackling drug-resistant TB forms. Ultimately, our research aims to strike a balance between scientific rigor and practical utility, offering valuable insights into treating MDR-TB and pre-XDR-TB in a challenging global health landscape. In summary, our study employs innovative trial designs and treatment strategies to address the complexities of treating drug-resistant TB, fulfilling a critical gap between ideal clinical trials and the reality of constrained resources and ethical considerations.

Children may be diagnosed with RR/MDR-TB based on microbiological confirmation from clinical specimens (sputum, gastric washings, stool), but usually the diagnosis is presumptive, with a history of exposure to RR/MDR-TB and clinical/radiological signs and symptoms suggestive of TB disease. RR/MDR-TB should also be considered in children where first-line TB treatment fails despite good adherence to therapy. Composition and duration of all-oral RR/MDR-TB treatment regimens in children are based on site and severity of TB disease, drug resistance profile of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain (isolated from the child or from the most likely source patient), inclusion of at least four drugs considered to be effective (with priority given to World Health Organization Group A and B drugs), toxicity and tolerability of medications (and feasibility of adverse effect monitoring in the child's setting), and availability of child-friendly formulations of TB medications. Individualized RR/MDR-TB regimens are preferable to the standardised 9-12-mo regimen for children, and injectable agents must not be used. Optimal adherence to treatment relies on education, training and support for caregivers and others who are responsible for administering medications to children, as well as close clinical monitoring and early management of adverse effects.

Respiratory medicine,"Around 500 000 people worldwide develop rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis each year. The proportion of successful treatment outcomes remains low and new treatments are needed. Following an interim analysis, we report the final safety and efficacy outcomes of the TB-PRACTECAL trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral regimens for the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.
This open-label, randomised, controlled, multi-arm, multicentre, non-inferiority trial was conducted at seven hospital and community sites in Uzbekistan, Belarus, and South Africa, and enrolled participants aged 15 years and older with pulmonary rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using variable block randomisation and stratified by trial site, to receive 36-80 week standard care; 24-week oral bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid (BPaL); BPaL plus clofazimine (BPaLC); or BPaL plus moxifloxacin (BPaLM) in stage one of the trial, and in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard care or BPaLM in stage two of the trial, the results of which are described here. Laboratory staff and trial sponsors were masked to group assignment and outcomes were assessed by unmasked investigators. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants with a composite unfavourable outcome (treatment failure, death, treatment discontinuation, disease recurrence, or loss to follow-up) at 72 weeks after randomisation in the modified intention-to-treat population (all participants with rifampicin-resistant disease who received at least one dose of study medication) and the per-protocol population (a subset of the modified intention-to-treat population excluding participants who did not complete a protocol-adherent course of treatment (other than because of treatment failure or death) and those who discontinued treatment early because they violated at least one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria). Safety was measured in the safety population. The non-inferiority margin was 12%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02589782, and is complete.
Between Jan 16, 2017, and March 18, 2021, 680 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 552 were enrolled and randomly assigned (152 to the standard care group, 151 to the BPaLM group, 126 to the BPaLC group, and 123 to the BPaL group). The standard care and BPaLM groups proceeded to stage two and are reported here, post-hoc analyses of the BPaLC and BPaL groups are also reported. 151 participants in the BPaLM group and 151 in the standard care group were included in the safety population, with 138 in the BPaLM group and 137 in the standard care group in the modified intention-to-treat population. In the modified intention-to-treat population, unfavourable outcomes were reported in 16 (12%) of 137 participants for whom outcome was assessable in the BPaLM group and 56 (41%) of 137 participants in the standard care group (risk difference -29·2 percentage points [96·6% CI -39·8 to -18·6]; non-inferiority and superiority p<0·0001). 34 (23%) of 151 participants receiving BPaLM had adverse events of grade 3 or higher or serious adverse events, compared with 72 (48%) of 151 participants receiving standard care (risk difference -25·2 percentage points [96·6% CI -36·4 to -13·9]). Five deaths were reported in the standard care group by week 72, of which one (COVID-19 pneumonia) was unrelated to treatment and four (acute pancreatitis, suicide, sudden death, and sudden cardiac death) were judged to be treatment-related.
The 24-week, all-oral BPaLM regimen is safe and efficacious for the treatment of pulmonary rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, and was added to the WHO guidance for treatment of this condition in 2022. These findings will be key to BPaLM becoming the preferred regimen for adolescents and adults with pulmonary rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.

It often presents with non-specific symptoms initially and has a high mortality and disability rate. With good central nervous system penetration, linezolid is recommended for treating drug-resistant, severe, or refractory tuberculous meningitis in China. Despite the benefits of linezolid on TBM treatment, the adverse effects of long-term therapy, such as myelosuppression, peripheral neuritis, and optic neuritis, are notable and can be severe and even life-threatening, leading to discontinuation and compromising treatment expectations. Contezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China in 2021, which has a more favorable safety profile than linezolid in terms of myelosuppression and monoamine oxidase inhibition. Here we first report a case of TBM in a patient who was intolerant to antituberculosis treatment with linezolid and achieved good efficacy and safety results after the compassionate use of contezolid. Given the widespread use of linezolid in TB treatment and the potential risks for long-term use, multi-center prospective controlled clinical trials in TB and TBM patients are needed to investigate the appropriate use of contezolid further.",,,,2023-11-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Characterizing serial Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates collected during BDQ-based treatment can provide insights into the etiologies of BDQ resistance in this important group of DRTB patients.
We measured mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT)-based BDQ minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Mtb isolates collected from 195 individuals with no prior BDQ exposure who were receiving BDQ-based treatment for DRTB. We conducted whole-genome sequencing on serial Mtb isolates from all participants who had any isolate with a BDQ MIC >1 collected before or after starting treatment (95 total Mtb isolates from 24 participants).
Sixteen of 24 participants had BDQ-resistant TB (MGIT MIC ≥4 µg/mL) and 8 had BDQ-intermediate infections (MGIT MIC = 2 µg/mL).

We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of linezolid in BPaL-containing regimens for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB among recently completed clinical trials.
A review and meta-analysis was undertaken including published and unpublished data from clinical trials, conducted between 2010 and 2021, that evaluated regimens containing BPaL for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB. Individual patient data were obtained. For each BPaL-containing regimen, we evaluated the frequency and severity of treatment-related adverse events. The risk difference of adverse events for each regimen was calculated, in comparison to patients assigned to receiving the lowest cumulative exposure of linezolid.
Data from 3 clinical trials investigating 8 unique BPaL-containing regimens were included, comprising a total of 591 participants. Adverse events were more frequent in groups randomized to a higher cumulative linezolid dose.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) drives MCL-1 expression (family member of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins) to limit apoptosis and grow intracellularly in human macrophages. The feasibility of re-purposing specific MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors to limit M.tb growth, using inhibitors that are in clinical trials and FDA-approved for cancer treatment has not be tested previously. We show that specifically inhibiting MCL-1 and BCL-2 induces apoptosis of M.tb-infected macrophages, and markedly reduces M.tb growth in human and murine macrophages, and in a pre-clinical model of human granulomas. MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors limit growth of drug resistant and susceptible M.tb in macrophages and act in additive fashion with the antibiotics isoniazid and rifampicin. This exciting work uncovers targeting the intrinsic apoptosis pathway as a promising approach for TB host-directed therapy. Since safety and activity studies are underway in cancer clinics for MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors, we expect that re-purposing them for TB treatment should translate more readily and rapidly to the clinic.

However, there is limited information on the global prevalence of resistance to these drugs and the impact of resistance on treatment outcomes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) phenotypic drug susceptibility and whole-genome sequence (WGS) data, as well as patient profiles from 4 pretomanid-containing trials-STAND, Nix-TB, ZeNix and SimpliciTB-were used to investigate the rates of baseline resistance (BR) and acquired resistance (AR) to BPaL drugs, as well as their genetic basis, risk factors and impact on treatment outcomes. Data from >1,000 TB patients enrolled from 2015 to 2020 in 12 countries was assessed. We identified 2 (0.3%) participants with linezolid BR. Pretomanid BR was also rare, with similar rates across TB drug resistance types (0-2.1%). In contrast, bedaquiline BR was more prevalent among participants with highly resistant TB or longer prior treatment histories than those with newly diagnosed disease (5.2-6.3% vs. 0-0.3%). Bedaquiline BR was a risk factor for bacteriological failure or relapse in Nix-TB/ZeNix; 3/12 (25%, 95% CI 5-57%) participants with vs. 6/185 (3.2%, 1.2-6.9%) without bedaquiline BR. Across trials, we observed no linezolid AR, and only 3 cases of bedaquiline AR, including 2 participants with poor adherence. Overall, pretomanid AR was also rare, except in ZeNix patients with bedaquiline BR. WGS analyses revealed novel mutations in canonical resistant genes and, in 7 MTB isolates, the genetic determinants could not be identified. The overall low rates of BR to linezolid and pretomanid, and to a lesser extent to bedaquiline, observed in the pretomanid trials are in support of the worldwide implementation of BPaL-based regimens. Similarly, the overall low AR rates observed suggest BPaL drugs are better protected in the regimens trialed here than in other regimens combining bedaquiline with more, but less effective drugs.",,,,2023-10-18,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The potential benefits of delivering TPT to MDR/RR-TB contacts extend beyond the outcomes that clinical trials can measure.
We developed an agent-based, household-structured TB and MDR/RR-TB transmission model, calibrated to an illustrative setting in India. We simulated contact investigation in households of patients with MDR/RR-TB, comparing an MDR/RR-TPT regimen (assuming 6-month duration, 70% efficacy) and associated active case finding against alternatives of contact investigation without TPT or no household intervention. We simulated the TB and MDR/RR-TB incidence averted relative to placebo over 2 years, as measurable by a typical trial, as well as the incidence averted over a longer time horizon, in the broader population, and relative to no contact investigation.
Observing TPT and placebo recipients for 2 years as in a typical trial, MDR/RR-TPT was measured to prevent 72% (interquartile range, 45%-100%) of incident MDR/RR-TB among recipients; the median number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 MDR/RR-TB case was 73, compared to placebo.

TB control programmes are facing threats from drug resistance. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mtb strains need longer and more expensive treatment with many medications resulting in more adverse effects and decreased chances of treatment outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the development of not just new individual anti-TB drugs, but also novel medication regimens as an alternative treatment option for the drug-resistant Mtb strains. Many plants, as well as marine creatures (sponge; Haliclona sp.) and fungi, have been continuously used to treat TB in various traditional treatment systems around the world, providing an almost limitless supply of active components. Natural products, in addition to their anti-mycobacterial action, can be used as adjuvant therapy to increase the efficacy of conventional anti-mycobacterial medications, reduce their side effects, and reverse MDR Mtb strain due to Mycobacterium's genetic flexibility and environmental adaptation. Several natural compounds such as quercetin, ursolic acid, berberine, thymoquinone, curcumin, phloretin, and propolis have shown potential anti-mycobacterial efficacy and are still being explored in preclinical and clinical investigations for confirmation of their efficacy and safety as anti-TB medication. However, more high-level randomized clinical trials are desperately required.

RATIONS is a field-based, cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of providing nutritional support to household contacts of adult patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in Jharkhand, India, on tuberculosis incidence. The patient cohort in both groups of the trial was provided with nutritional support. In this study, we assessed the effects of nutritional support on tuberculosis mortality, treatment success, and other outcomes in the RATIONS patient cohort.
We enrolled patients (aged 18 years or older) with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis across 28 tuberculosis units. Patients received nutritional support in the form of food rations (1200 kcal and 52 g of protein per day) and micronutrient pills. Nutritional support was for 6 months for drug-susceptible tuberculosis and 12 months for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis could receive an extension of up to 6 months if their BMI was less than 18·5 kg/m
Between Aug 16, 2019, and Jan 31, 2021, 2800 patients (mean age 41·5 years [SD 14·5]; 1979 [70·7%] men and 821 [29·3%] women) were enrolled. At enrolment, 2291 (82·4%) patients were underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m
In this study, nutritional support was provided to a cohort with a high prevalence of severe undernutrition. Weight gain, particularly in the first 2 months, was associated with a substantially decreased hazard of tuberculosis mortality. Nutritional support needs to be an integral component of patient-centred care to improve treatment outcomes in such settings.

Side-effects/symptoms that were visible signs of illness were particularly troubling. Good relations with clinical staff helped combat fear and uncertainty regarding treatment. (2) Mental distress and opportunities for wellbeing: The shame, stigma and isolation people experienced as a result of their DR-TB diagnosis was an important cause of mental distress. No longer being infectious enabled people to resume work and socialising. Positive emotions emerged with good treatment outcomes. (3) Fear and worry along the treatment journey: Participants expressed fears about TB: infecting others; whether they would be able to endure treatment; side-effects; health consequences of treatment.

The systematic stratification of patients for personalized treatment does not exist for TB. As each TB case is different, individualized treatment regimens should be applied to obtain better outcomes. In this scenario, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to (1) improve outcomes and (2) shorten treatment duration, and host-directed therapies (HDT) might be the best solution. Within HDT, repurposed drugs represent a shortcut in drug development and can be implemented at the short term. As hyperinflammation is associated with worse outcomes, HDT with an anti-inflammatory effect might improve outcomes by reducing tissue damage and thus the risk of permanent sequelae.
SMA-TB is a multicentre randomized, phase IIB, placebo-controlled, three-arm, double-blinded clinical trial (CT) that has been designed in the context of the EC-funded SMA-TB Project ( www.smatb.eu ) in which we propose to use 2 common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ibuprofen (Ibu), as an HDT for use as adjunct therapy added to, and compared with, the standard of care (SoC) World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended TB regimen in TB patients. A total of 354 South African and Georgian adults diagnosed with confirmed pulmonary TB will be randomized into SoC TB treatment + placebo, SoC + acetylsalicylic acid or SoC + ibuprofen.
SMA-TB will provide proof of concept of the HDT as a co-adjuvant treatment and identify the suitability of the intervention for different population groups (different epidemiological settings and drug susceptibility) in the reduction of tissue damage and risk of bad outcomes for TB patients. This regimen potentially will be more effective and targeted: organ saving, reducing tissue damage and thereby decreasing the length of treatment and sequelae, increasing cure rates and pathogen clearance and decreasing transmission rates. It will result in better clinical practice, care management and increased well-being of TB patients.

37319311,Optimizing tuberculosis treatment efficacy: Comparing the standard regimen with Moxifloxacin-containing regimens.,,PLoS computational biology,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world, causing ~1.5 million deaths every year. The World Health Organization initiated an End TB Strategy that aims to reduce TB-related deaths in 2035 by 95%. Recent research goals have focused on discovering more effective and more patient-friendly antibiotic drug regimens to increase patient compliance and decrease emergence of resistant TB. Moxifloxacin is one promising antibiotic that may improve the current standard regimen by shortening treatment time. Clinical trials and in vivo mouse studies suggest that regimens containing moxifloxacin have better bactericidal activity. However, testing every possible combination regimen with moxifloxacin either in vivo or clinically is not feasible due to experimental and clinical limitations. To identify better regimens more systematically, we simulated pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of various regimens (with and without moxifloxacin) to evaluate efficacies, and then compared our predictions to both clinical trials and nonhuman primate studies performed herein. We used GranSim, our well-established hybrid agent-based model that simulates granuloma formation and antibiotic treatment, for this task. In addition, we established a multiple-objective optimization pipeline using GranSim to discover optimized regimens based on treatment objectives of interest, i.e., minimizing total drug dosage and lowering time needed to sterilize granulomas. Our approach can efficiently test many regimens and successfully identify optimal regimens to inform pre-clinical studies or clinical trials and ultimately accelerate the TB regimen discovery process.",,,,2023-06-15,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from a bacterial infectious disease worldwide. The World Health Organization's ambitious goal from 2014 of achieving global elimination of tuberculosis does not seem realistic, but on current trends, tuberculosis could be eliminated in the European Union by 2040. Since the beginning of 2022, there have been more innovations for the treatment of tuberculosis than in no other comparable time period before. One month of rifapentine and isoniazid is effective in treating latent tuberculosis infection. However, rifapentine is licensed in the USA but not in the EU and must be imported for individual cases. The duration of the standard treatment for tuberculosis can be shortened to four months but this treatment regimen is also based on rifapentine, in addition to isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin. The approval of rifapentine in Europe is a much-needed step towards shortening the treatment of tuberculosis. With new drugs an even shorter standard treatment of only 2 months is possible. The treatment of multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-/RR-TB) has been shortened to six months, the same length as the standard treatment available in Germany. The combination of bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid ± moxifloxacin, cured around 90% of affected patients were cured in studies with a treatment duration of six months. With 19 drugs in clinical trials, the treatment of tuberculosis is expected to continue to improve rapidly in the coming years.
Noch nie waren so viele Menschen auf der Welt gleichzeitig an einer Tuberkulose erkrankt wie in der heutigen Zeit. Auch ist die Tuberkulose weiterhin die häufigste zum Tode führende bakterielle Infektionskrankheit weltweit. Die ambitionierten Ziele der Weltgesundheitsorganisation aus dem Jahr 2014, eine baldige globale Elimination der Tuberkulose zu erreichen, erscheinen nicht realistisch. Aber dem aktuellen Trend folgend, könnte die Tuberkulose bis 2040 in der EU eliminiert werden. Seit Beginn des Jahres 2022 hat es so viele Innovationen für die Behandlung der Tuberkulose gegeben, wie in keiner anderen vergleichbaren Zeitspanne zuvor. Eine effektive Therapie der latenten Tuberkulose ist nun über nur einen Monat hinweg mit Rifapentin und Isoniazid möglich, allerdings ist Rifapentin zwar in den USA, aber nicht in der EU zugelassen und muss für den Einzelfall importiert werden. Die Dauer der Standardtherapie der Tuberkulose kann auf vier Monate verkürzt werden, allerdings beruht auch dieses Therapieregime neben Isoniazid, Pyrazinamid und Moxifloxacin auf Rifapentin. Die Zulassung von Rifapentin in Europa ist somit ein dringend notwendiger Schritt, um die Therapie der Tuberkulose zu verkürzen. Mit neuen Medikamenten könnten noch kürzere Standardtherapien von nur zwei Monaten möglich sein. Die Therapie der multiresistenten/rifampicinresistenten Tuberkulose (MDR-/RR-TB) hat sich auf sechs Monate verkürzt und ist damit genau so lang, wie die in Deutschland verfügbare Standardtherapie.

Improved oxazolidinones should have a better safety profile, while preserving efficacy. Delpazolid is a novel oxazolidinone developed by LegoChem Biosciences Inc. that has been evaluated up to phase 2a clinical trials. Since oxazolidinone toxicity can occur late in treatment, LegoChem Biosciences Inc. and the PanACEA Consortium designed DECODE to be an innovative dose-ranging study with long-term follow-up for determining the exposure-response and exposure-toxicity relationship of delpazolid to support dose selection for later studies. Delpazolid is administered in combination with bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin.
Seventy-five participants with drug-sensitive, pulmonary tuberculosis will receive bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin, and will be randomized to delpazolid dosages of 0 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg once daily, or 800 mg twice daily, for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the rate of decline of bacterial load on treatment, measured by MGIT liquid culture time to detection from weekly sputum cultures. The primary safety endpoint will be the proportion of oxazolidinone class toxicities; neuropathy, myelosuppression, or tyramine pressor response. Participants who convert to negative liquid media culture by week 8 will stop treatment after the end of their 16-week course and will be observed for relapse until week 52. Participants who do not convert to negative culture will receive continuation phase treatment with rifampicin and isoniazid to complete a six-month treatment course.
DECODE is an innovative dose-finding trial, designed to support exposure-response modelling for safe and effective dose selection. The trial design allows assessment of occurrence of late toxicities as observed with linezolid, which is necessary in clinical evaluation of novel oxazolidinones. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in bacterial load, an endpoint conventionally used in shorter dose-finding trials. Long-term follow-up after shortened treatment is possible through a safety rule excluding slow-and non-responders from potentially poorly performing dosages.

However, its benefits in tailoring the treatment regimen and improving the outcome for patients with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) require further investigation. In this study, the Xpert MTB/XDR assay was used to determine the resistance profile of second-line drugs for RR-TB patients in two registered multicenter clinical trials, TB-TRUST (NCT03867136) and TB-TRUST-plus (NCT04717908), with the aim of testing the efficacy of all-oral shorter regimens in RR-TB patients in China. Patients would receive the fluoroquinolone-based all-oral shorter regimen, the injectable-containing regimen, or the bedaquiline-based regimen depending on fluoroquinolone susceptibility by using Xpert MTB/XDR. Among the 497 patients performed with Xpert MTB/XDR, 128 (25.8%) had infections resistant to fluoroquinolones and/or second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs). A total of 371 participants were recruited for the trials, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all corresponding culture-positive baseline strains. Taking the WGS results as the standard, the accuracy of the Xpert MTB/XDR assay in terms of resistance detection was 95.2% to 99.0% for all drugs. A total of 33 cases had inconsistent results, 9 of which were due to resistance heterogeneity. Most of the patients (241/281, 85.8%) had sputum culture conversion at 2 months.

Bedaquiline carries a black box warning of increased risk of death compared to the placebo arm, and there is a need to establish the risks of QT prolongation and hepatotoxicity for bedaquiline and delamanid.
We retrospectively analyzed data of MDR-TB patients retrieved from the South Korea national health insurance system database (2014-2020) to assess the risks of all-cause death, long QT-related cardiac event, and acute liver injury associated with bedaquiline or delamanid, compared with conventional regimen. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting based on propensity score was used to balance characteristics between the treatment groups.
Of 1998 patients, 315 (15.8%) and 292 (14.6%) received bedaquiline and delamanid, respectively.

Directly observed therapy (DOT) is the recommended approach for the management of patients with MDR-TB. Uganda implements a health facility-based DOT approach where all patients diagnosed with MDR-TB report to the nearest private or public health facility for daily observation of ingesting their medicines by a health care provider. Directly observed therapy is very costly for both the patient and health care system. It follows the assumption that MDR TB patients have a history of poor adherence to TB treatment. But only 21% of MDR-TB patients notified globally and 1.4-12% notified in Uganda had been previously treated for TB. The shift to all oral treatment regimen for MDR-TB provides an opportunity for the exploration of self-administered therapy for this group of patients even with use of remotely operated adherence technology. We are conducting a non-inferiority open-label randomized controlled trial to compare adherence to MDR-TB treatment among patients on self-administered therapy (measured by Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS) technology) with a control group on DOT.
We plan to enrol 164 newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients aged ≥ 8 years from three regional hospitals based in rural and urban Uganda. Patients with conditions that affect their dexterity and ability to operate the MEMS-operated medicine equipment will not be eligible to participate in the trial. Patients are randomized to either of the two study arms: self-administered therapy with adherence being monitored using MEMS technology (intervention arm) or health facility-based DOT (control arm) and will be followed up monthly. Adherence is measured by the number of days the medicine bottle is open to access medication as recorded by the MEMS software in the intervention arm and treatment complaint days as recorded in the TB treatment card in the control arm. The primary outcome is the comparison of adherence rates between the two study arms.
The evaluation of self-administered therapy for patients with MDR-TB is important to inform cost-effective management strategies for these patients. The approval of all oral regimens for the treatment of MDR-TB provides an opportunity for innovations such as MEMS technology to support sustainable options for MDR-TB treatment adherence support in low-resource settings.

We prospectively enrolled RR-TB patients in the registered trials, and their baseline sputum samples were obtained to perform the assay and culture. DNA sequencing of culture isolates was analyzed and used as the reference standard. Sanger sequencing was performed for samples with discrepant results between next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the investigational assay. The main analysis was conducted in the population of patients with interpretable results by both NGS and the assay. A total of 239 patients with RR-TB were screened, and 220 underwent the MeltPro MTB/PZA assay. The assay provided no information for 25 of 220 patients (11.4%).

We did a cluster-randomised superiority trial across four prefectures in China. 24 counties or districts (clusters) were randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention or control groups. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with GeneXpert-positive, rifampicin-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis, who were receiving daily fixed-dose combination treatment. Patients in the intervention group received a medication monitor for daily drug-dosing reminders, monthly review of adherence data by health-care provider, and management of poor adherence; and patients in the control group received routine care (silent-mode monitor-measured adherence). Only the independent endpoints review committee who assessed endpoint data for some participants were masked to study group assignment. Patients were followed up (with sputum solid culture) at 12 and 18 months. The primary outcome was a composite of death, loss to follow-up, treatment failure, switch to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, or tuberculosis recurrence by 18 months from treatment start, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Analysis accounted for study design with multiple imputation for the primary outcome. This trial is now complete and is registered with ISRCTN, 35812455.
Between Jan 26, 2017, and April 3, 2019, 15 257 patients were assessed for eligibility and 3074 were enrolled, 2686 (87%) of whom were included in the intention-to-treat population. 1909 (71%) of 2686 patients were male, 777 (29%) were female, and the median age was 44 years (IQR 29-58). By 18 months from treatment start, using multiple imputation for missing outcomes, 239 (16% [geometric mean of cluster-level proportion]) of 1388 patients in the control group and 224 (16%) of 1298 in the intervention group had a primary composite outcome event (289 [62%] of 463 events were loss to follow-up during treatment and 42 [9%] were tuberculosis recurrence). The intervention had no effect on risk of the primary composite outcome (adjusted risk ratio 1·01, 95% CI 0·73-1·40).
Our digital medication monitor intervention had no effect on unfavourable outcomes, which included loss to follow-up during treatment, tuberculosis recurrence, death, and treatment failure. There was a failure to change patient management following identification of treatment non-adherence at monthly reviews. A better understanding of adherence patterns and how they relate to poor outcomes, coupled with a more timely review of adherence data and improved implementation of differentiated care, may be required.

37005695,"Protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of N-acetylcysteine in reducing adverse drug reactions among adults treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Tanzania.","Adverse drug reactions, Clinical trial, Drug-induced Liver injury, Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, N-acetylcyteine",Pilot and feasibility studies,"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) frequently occur in patients using second-line anti-tuberculosis medicine for treatment of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). ADRs contribute to treatment interruptions which can compromise treatment response and risk acquired drug resistance to critical newer drugs such as bedaquiline, while severe ADRs carry considerable morbidity and mortality. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown promise in reducing ADRs for medications related to TB in case series or randomized controlled trials in other medical conditions, yet evidence is lacking in MDR-TB patients. TB endemic settings have limited capacity to conduct clinical trials. We designed a proof-of-concept clinical trial primarily to explore the preliminary evidence on the protective effect of NAC among people treated for MDR-TB with second-line anti-TB medications.
This is a proof-of-concept randomized open label clinical trial with 3 treatment arms including a control arm, an interventional arm of NAC 900 mg daily, and an interventional arm of NAC 900 mg twice-daily administered during the intensive phase of MDR-TB treatment. Patients initiating MDR-TB treatment will be enrolled at Kibong'oto National Center of Excellence for MDR-TB in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. The minimum anticipated sample size is 66; with 22 participants in each arm. ADR monitoring will be performed at baseline and daily follow-up over 24 weeks including blood and urine specimen collection for hepatic and renal function and electrolyte abnormalities, and electrocardiogram. Sputum will be collected at baseline and monthly thereafter and cultured for mycobacteria as well as assayed for other molecular targets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Adverse drug events will be analysed over time using mixed effect models. Mean differences between arms in change of the ADRs from baseline (with 95% confidence intervals) will be derived from the fitted model.
Given that NAC promotes synthesis of glutathione, an intracellular antioxidant that combats the impact of oxidative stress, it may protect against medication induced oxidative damage in organs such as liver, pancreas, kidney, and cells of the immune system. This randomized controlled trial will determine if NAC leads to fewer ADRs, and if this protection is dose dependent. Fewer ADRs among patients treated with MDR-TB may significantly improve treatment outcomes for multidrug regimens that necessitate prolonged treatment durations. Conduct of this trial will set the needed infrastructure for clinical trials.

We used a well-established BALB/c mouse model of tuberculosis to evaluate the treatment-shortening potential of replacing bedaquiline with either of two new, more potent diarylquinolines, TBAJ-587 and TBAJ-876, in early clinical trials. We also evaluated the effect of replacing linezolid with a new oxazolidinone, TBI-223, exhibiting a larger safety margin with respect to mitochondrial toxicity in preclinical studies. Replacing bedaquiline with TBAJ-587 at the same 25-mg/kg dose significantly reduced the proportion of mice relapsing after 2 months of treatment, while replacing linezolid with TBI-223 at the same 100-mg/kg dose did not significantly change the proportion of mice relapsing. Replacing linezolid or TBI-223 with sutezolid in combination with TBAJ-587 and pretomanid significantly reduced the proportion of mice relapsing. In combination with pretomanid and TBI-223, TBAJ-876 at 6.25 mg/kg was equipotent to TBAJ-587 at 25 mg/kg. We conclude that replacement of bedaquiline with these more efficacious and potentially safer diarylquinolines and replacement of linezolid with potentially safer and at least as efficacious oxazolidinones in the clinically successful BPaL regimen may lead to superior regimens capable of treating both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB more effectively and safely.",,,,2023-03-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

However, the recommendation of DOTS (approved by WHO) was effective in treating tuberculosis, but nowadays, resistance from the first line (MDR-TB) and the second line (XDR-TB) drugs is highly common. Whereas, the resistance is a result of factors like poor patient constancy due to the long duration of therapy and co-infection with HIV. The approval of bedaquiline under an accelerated program for the treatment of MDR-TB has revealed its effectiveness in clinical trials as a therapeutic novel molecule. BDQ selectively inhibits the ATP synthase of bacterium and reduces ATP production. Additionally, the poor pharmacokinetic properties raised provocations in the MDR therapy, but the use of targeted drug delivery can solve the hurdles. While the preclinical and clinical studies included in this review are strongly suggesting the usefulness of BDQ in MDR-TB and XDR-TB, the repurposing of different drug classes in resistant TB is opening new opportunities to manage the disease conditions. In this review, we have summarized the examples of pipeline drugs and repurposed molecules with preclinical formulation developments.",,,,2023-03-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We qualitatively evaluated the implementation of an Evidence-Based Multiple Focus Integrated Intensified TB Screening package (EXIT-TB) in the East African region, aimed at increasing TB case detection and number of patients receiving care.
We present the accounts of participants from Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia regarding the implementation of EXIT-TB, and suggestions for scaling up.
A qualitative descriptive design was used to gather insights from purposefully selected healthcare workers, community health workers, and other stakeholders. A total of 27, 13, 14, and 19 in-depth interviews were conducted in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia respectively. Data were transcribed and translated simultaneously and then thematically analysed.
The EXIT-TB project was described to contribute to increased TB case detection, improved detection of Multidrug-resistant TB patients, reduced delays and waiting time for diagnosis, raised the index of TB suspicion, and improved decision-making among HCWs. The attributes of TB case detection were: (i) free X-ray screening services; (ii) integrating TB case-finding activities in other clinics such as Reproductive and Child Health clinics (RCH), and diabetic clinics; (iii), engagement of CHWs, policymakers, and ministry level program managers; (iv) enhanced community awareness and linkage of clients; (v) cooperation between HCWs and CHWs, (vi) improved screening infrastructure, (vii) the adoption of the new simplified screening criteria and (viii) training of implementers. The supply-side challenges encountered ranged from disorganized care, limited space, the COVID-19 pandemic, inadequate human resources, inadequate knowledge and expertise, stock out of supplies, delayed maintenance of equipment, to absence of X-ray and GeneXpert machines in some facilities. The demand side challenges ranged from delayed care seeking, inadequate awareness, negative beliefs, fears towards screening, to financial challenges. Suggestions for scaling up ranged from improving service delivery, access to diagnostic equipment and supplies, and infrastructure, to addressing client fears and stigma.

Infectious diseases,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a substantial health-care concern worldwide. Despite culture-based methods being considered the gold standard for drug susceptibility testing, molecular methods provide rapid information about the Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutations associated with resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs. This consensus document was developed on the basis of a comprehensive literature search, by the TBnet and RESIST-TB networks, about reporting standards for the clinical use of molecular drug susceptibility testing. Review and the search for evidence included hand-searching journals and searching electronic databases. The panel identified studies that linked mutations in genomic regions of M tuberculosis with treatment outcome data. Implementation of molecular testing for the prediction of drug resistance in M tuberculosis is key. Detection of mutations in clinical isolates has implications for the clinical management of patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, especially in situations when phenotypic drug susceptibility testing is not available. A multidisciplinary team including clinicians, microbiologists, and laboratory scientists reached a consensus on key questions relevant to molecular prediction of drug susceptibility or resistance to M tuberculosis, and their implications for clinical practice.

In this adaptive, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned participants with rifampin-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis to undergo either standard treatment (rifampin and isoniazid for 24 weeks with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for the first 8 weeks) or a strategy involving initial treatment with an 8-week regimen, extended treatment for persistent clinical disease, monitoring after treatment, and retreatment for relapse. There were four strategy groups with different initial regimens; noninferiority was assessed in the two strategy groups with complete enrollment, which had initial regimens of high-dose rifampin-linezolid and bedaquiline-linezolid (each with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). The primary outcome was a composite of death, ongoing treatment, or active disease at week 96. The noninferiority margin was 12 percentage points.
Of the 674 participants in the intention-to-treat population, 4 (0.6%) withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up. A primary-outcome event occurred in 7 of the 181 participants (3.9%) in the standard-treatment group, as compared with 21 of the 184 participants (11.4%) in the strategy group with an initial rifampin-linezolid regimen (adjusted difference, 7.4 percentage points; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 13.2; noninferiority not met) and 11 of the 189 participants (5.8%) in the strategy group with an initial bedaquiline-linezolid regimen (adjusted difference, 0.8 percentage points; 97.5% CI, -3.4 to 5.1; noninferiority met). The mean total duration of treatment was 180 days in the standard-treatment group, 106 days in the rifampin-linezolid strategy group, and 85 days in the bedaquiline-linezolid strategy group.

The phase 3 clinical trial Nix-TB (NCT02333799) tested a 6-month treatment of MDR and XDR-TB consisting of high-dose linezolid, bedaquiline, and pretomanid (BPaL). In this study, we investigate the relationship between the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drugs, patient characteristics and efficacy endpoints from Nix-TB.
Pharmacokinetic data were collected at weeks 2, 8, and 16. Efficacy endpoints including treatment outcomes, time to stable culture conversion, and longitudinal time to positivity in the mycobacterial growth indicator tube assay were each characterized using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Relationships between patient, treatment pharmacokinetics, and disease characteristics and efficacy endpoints were evaluated.
Data from 93 (85% of the total) participants were analyzed. Higher body mass index was associated with a lower incidence of unfavorable treatment outcomes. Median time to stable culture conversion was 3 months in patients with lower baseline burden compared with 4.5 months in patients with high baseline burden. Participants with minimal disease had steeper time to positivity trajectories compared with participants with high-risk phenotypes. No relationship between any drugs' pharmacokinetics (drug concentration or exposure metrics) and any efficacy outcomes was observed.
We have successfully described efficacy endpoints of a BPaL regimen from the Nix-TB trial. Participants with high-risk phenotypes significantly delayed time to culture conversion and bacterial clearance. The lack of a relationship between pharmacokinetic exposures and pharmacodynamic biomarkers opens the possibility to use lower, safer doses, particularly for toxicity-prone linezolid.

The potential benefits of TPT for MDR-TB contacts extend beyond the outcomes that clinical trials can measure.
We developed an agent-based, household-structured TB and MDR-TB transmission model, calibrated to an illustrative setting in India, the country accounting for 26% of global MDR-TB burden. We simulated household contact investigation for contacts of patients with MDR-TB, comparing an MDR-TPT regimen against alternatives of isoniazid preventive treatment, household contact investigation without TPT, or no household contact intervention. We simulated outcomes of a clinical trial and estimated the patient-level and population-level effects over a longer time horizon.
During two years of follow-up per recipient, a simulated 6-month MDR-TPT regimen with 70% efficacy against both DS- and MDR-TB infection could prevent 72% [Interquartile range (IQR): 45 - 100%] of incident MDR-TB among TPT recipients (number needed to treat (NNT) 73 [44 - 176] to prevent one MDR-TB case), compared to household contact investigation without TPT. This NNT decreased to 54 [30 - 183] when median follow-up was increased from two to 16 years, to 27 [11 - Inf] when downstream transmission effects were also considered, and to 12 [8 - 22] when these effects were compared to a scenario of no household contact intervention.
If forthcoming trial results demonstrate efficacy, the long-term population impact of MDR-TPT implementation could be much greater than suggested by trial outcomes alone.

In the last decade, novel and repurposed antituberculosis drugs have transformed MDR-TB treatment with improved rates of treatment success, better tolerability and safety and reduced duration. As recently as 2016, standard care relied on up to seven drugs for 24 months with treatment success no better than 70%. Seven drug shorter so-called ""Bangladesh"" style regimens subsequently achieved similar or better results at a duration of 9-12 months but concerns about first-line resistance additional to rifampicin hampered global uptake. After conditional approval in 2012, the novel agent bedaquiline was demonstrated to improve outcomes and reduce mortality when used in longer and shorter regimens, resulting in the replacement of injectable agents. In the last 2 years, clinical trials of all-oral 6-month three or four drug regimens containing bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid have shown superior efficacy against both longer and shorter traditional regimens, resulting in major changes in WHO guidance.

STREAM was an MDR-TB clinical trial that recruited over 1000 participants. We documented challenges and best practices/lessons learned from the site perspective to improve implementation of future trials.
We conducted a voluntary survey of trial staff at all sites to obtain information on challenges encountered and best practices/lessons learned from implementation of the STREAM trial. Respondents were asked to identify substantive aspects of trial implementation from a list that included: trial administration, laboratory strengthening/infrastructure, pharmacy and supply chain management, community engagement, regulatory and ethics requirements, health economics, and other (respondent designated) about which a practical guide would be useful to improve future trial implementation. For each aspect of trial implementation selected, respondents were asked to report challenges and best practices/lessons learned during STREAM. Lastly, respondents were asked to list up to three things they would do differently when implementing future trials. Summary statistics were generated for quantitative data and thematic analysis was undertaken for qualitative data.
Of 67 responses received from 13 of 15 sites, 47 (70%) were included in the analyses, after excluding duplicate or incomplete responses. Approximately half the respondents were investigators or trial coordinators. The top three aspects of trial implementation identified for a best practices/lessons learned practical guide to improve future trial implementation were: trial administration, community engagement, and laboratory strengthening/infrastructure. For both challenges and best practices/lessons learned, three common themes were identified across different aspects of trial implementation. Investment in capacity building and ongoing monitoring; investment in infrastructure and well-designed trial processes; and communication and coordination between staff and meaningful engagement of stakeholders were all thought to be critical to successful trial implementation.

Global health,"The STREAM stage 2 trial assessed two bedaquiline-containing regimens for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis: a 9-month all-oral regimen and a 6-month regimen containing an injectable drug for the first 2 months. We did a within-trial economic evaluation of these regimens.
STREAM stage 2 was an international, phase 3, non-inferiority randomised trial in which participants with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis were randomly assigned (1:2:2:2) to the 2011 WHO regimen (terminated early), a 9-month injectable-containing regimen (control regimen), a 9-month all-oral regimen with bedaquiline (oral regimen), or a 6-month regimen with bedaquiline and an injectable for the first 2 months (6-month regimen). We prospectively collected direct and indirect costs and health-related quality of life data from trial participants until week 76 of follow-up. Cost-effectiveness of the oral and 6-month regimens versus control was estimated in four countries (oral regimen) and two countries (6-month regimen), using health-related quality of life for cost-utility analysis and trial efficacy for cost-effectiveness analysis. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN18148631.
300 participants were included in the economic analyses (Ethiopia, 61; India, 142; Moldova, 51; Uganda, 46). In the cost-utility analysis, the oral regimen was not cost-effective in Ethiopia, India, Moldova, and Uganda from either a provider or societal perspective. In Moldova, the oral regimen was dominant from a societal perspective. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the oral regimen was likely to be cost-effective from a provider perspective at willingness-to-pay thresholds per additional favourable outcome of more than US$4500 in Ethiopia, $1900 in India, $3950 in Moldova, and $7900 in Uganda, and from a societal perspective at thresholds of more than $15 900 in Ethiopia, $3150 in India, and $4350 in Uganda, while in Moldova the oral regimen was dominant. In Ethiopia and India, the 6-month regimen would cost tuberculosis programmes and participants less than the control regimen and was highly likely to be cost-effective in both cost-utility analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. Reducing the bedaquiline price from $1·81 to $1·00 per tablet made the oral regimen cost-effective in the provider-perspective cost-utility analysis in India and Moldova and dominate over the control regimen in the provider-perspective cost-effectiveness analysis in India.
At current costs, the oral bedaquiline-containing regimen for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis is unlikely to be cost-effective in many low-income and middle-income countries. The 6-month regimen represents a cost-effective alternative if injectable use for 2 months is acceptable.

In this multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 2/3 non-inferiority trial, we enrolled men and women aged 19-85 years with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis confirmed by phenotypic or genotypic drug susceptibility tests or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis by genotypic tests at 12 participating hospitals throughout South Korea. Participants with fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups using a block randomisation, stratified by the presence of diabetes and cavitation on baseline chest radiographs. The investigational group received delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide for 9 months, and the control group received a conventional 20-24-month regimen, according to the 2014 WHO guidelines.

In Niger, a high cure rate was obtained with a RR-TB treatment strategy based on a second-line injectable drug (SLID)-containing Short Treatment Regimen (STR), with linezolid replacing the SLID in patients with ototoxicity. Given the availability of novel anti-tuberculosis drugs, WHO recommends all-oral RR-TB treatment. Considering the high level of success with the Niger treatment strategy, it would only be justified to replace it in case robust evidence shows that the WHO all-oral bedaquiline/linezolid (BDQ/LZD)-containing STR (experimental arm) performs better than the Niger RR-TB treatment strategy, (control arm) in terms of safety, effectiveness and adherence.
A pragmatic randomised clinical trial (RCT) using stratified block randomisation, conducted between April 2021 and March 2024, prospectively enrols participants diagnosed with RR-TB in one of the four RR-TB units of the nation. Depending of the month in which patients are diagnosed with RR-TB, patients with FQ-susceptible RR-TB are enrolled in either the experimental arm or control arm.
To increase the feasibility of conducting a RCT, embedded in routine activities of all Niger's RR-TB Units, we used a creative trial design. We randomised by monthly blocks, whereby the regimen used changes every month, using the month of RR-TB diagnosis as stratifying variable. This approach was deemed feasible for Niger's national tuberculosis programme, as it simplifies the work of the clinicians running the RR-TB units. Our creative design may serve as an example for other national programs. Findings will inform national and international RR-TB treatment guidelines, and will also strengthen the evidence-base on how to develop robust RR-TB treatment regimens.

We did a randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial in 13 hospital clinics in seven countries, in individuals aged 15 years or older with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis without fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside resistance. Participants were randomly assigned 1:2:2:2 to the 2011 WHO regimen (terminated early), a 9-month control regimen, a 9-month oral regimen with bedaquiline (primary comparison), or a 6-month regimen with bedaquiline and 8 weeks of second-line injectable. Randomisations were stratified by site, HIV status, and CD4 count. Participants and clinicians were aware of treatment-group assignments, but laboratory staff were masked. The primary outcome was favourable status (negative cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis without a preceding unfavourable outcome) at 76 weeks; any death, bacteriological failure or recurrence, and major treatment change were considered unfavourable outcomes. All comparisons used groups of participants randomly assigned concurrently. For non-inferiority to be shown, the upper boundary of the 95% CI should be less than 10% in both modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol analyses, with prespecified tests for superiority done if non-inferiority was shown. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN18148631.

By 76 weeks, 108 (53%) of 202 participants on the control regimen and 106 (50%) of 211 allocated to the oral regimen had an adverse event of grade 3 or 4; five (2%) participants on the control regimen and seven (3%) on the oral regimen had died. Hearing loss (Brock grade 3 or 4) was more frequent in participants on the control regimen than in those on the oral regimen (18 [9%] vs four [2%], p=0·0015). Of 134 participants in the mITT population who were allocated to the 6-month regimen, 122 (91%) had a favourable outcome compared with 87 (69%) of 127 participants randomly assigned concurrently to the control regimen (adjusted difference 22·2%, 95% CI 13·1-31·2); six (4%) of 143 participants on the 6-month regimen had grade 3 or 4 hearing loss.
Both bedaquiline-containing regimens, a 9-month oral regimen and a 6-month regimen with 8 weeks of second-line injectable, had superior efficacy compared with a 9-month injectable-containing regimen, with fewer cases of hearing loss.

Ideally, the complete drug-resistance profile guides individualized treatment for all RR-TB patients, but this is only practised in high-income countries. Implementation of whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies into routine care in low and middle-income countries has not become a reality due to the expected implementation challenges, including translating WGS results into individualized treatment regimen composition.
This trial is a pragmatic, single-blinded, randomized controlled medical device trial of a WGS-guided automated treatment recommendation strategy for individualized treatment of RR-TB. Subjects are 18 years or older and diagnosed with pulmonary RR-TB in four of the five health districts of the Free State province in South Africa. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention (a WGS-guided automated treatment recommendation strategy for individualized treatment of RR-TB) or control (RR-TB treatment according to the national South African guidelines). The primary effectiveness outcome is the bacteriological response to treatment measured as the rate of change in time to liquid culture positivity during the first 6 months of treatment. Secondary effectiveness outcomes include cure rate, relapse rate (recurrence of RR-TB disease) and TB free survival rate in the first 12 months following RR-TB treatment completion. Additional secondary outcomes of interest include safety, the feasibility of province-wide implementation of the strategy into routine care, and health economic assessment from a patient and health systems perspective.
This trial will provide important real-life evidence regarding the feasibility, safety, cost, and effectiveness of a WGS-guided automated treatment recommendation strategy for individualized treatment of RR-TB. Given the pragmatic nature, the trial will assist policymakers in the decision-making regarding the integration of next-generation sequencing technologies into routine RR-TB care in high TB burden settings.

This pathway, along with the methylcitrate cycle, facilitates the utilization of fatty acids as a carbon source inside hostile host environments such as in granulomas, and hence enzymes of this pathway are novel antitubercular targets. The genome sequence of pathogenic Mtb H37Rv presents three ICLs annotated as Rv0467 (prokaryotic homologue), Rv1915 and Rv1916. The latter two, Rv1915 and Rv1916, together constitute the longer version of ICL2, a eukaryotic counterpart. Despite being a well-known drug target, no Mtb ICL inhibitor has reached clinical trials due to challenges associated with targeting all the 3 orthologs. This gap is the result of uncharacterized Rv1915 and Rv1916. This review aims to appreciate chronologically the key studies that have built our comprehension of Mtb ICLs. Recently characterized Mtb Rv1915 and Rv1916, which further open venues for developing effective inhibitors against the persistent and drug-resistant Mtb, are discussed separately.",,,,2022-10-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The DR-TB treatment landscape has evolved over the last 10 years. Recent developments include the remarkable activity demonstrated by the newly approved anti-TB drugs bedaquiline and pretomanid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Hence, treatment of DR-TB has drastically evolved with the introduction of the short-course regimen for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), transitioning to injection-free regimens and the approval of the 6-month short regimens for rifampin-resistant TB and MDR-TB. Moreover, numerous clinical trials are under way with the aim to reduce pill burden and shorten the DR-TB treatment duration. While there have been apparent successes in the field, some challenges remain. These include the ongoing inclusion of high-dose isoniazid in DR-TB regimens despite a lack of evidence for its efficacy and the inclusion of ethambutol and pyrazinamide in the standard short regimen despite known high levels of background resistance to both drugs. Furthermore, antimicrobial heteroresistance, extensive cavitary disease and intracavitary gradients, the emergence of bedaquiline resistance, and the lack of biomarkers to monitor DR-TB treatment response remain serious challenges to the sustained successes. In this review, we outline the impact of the new drugs and regimens on patient treatment outcomes, explore evidence underpinning current practices on regimen selection and duration, reflect on the disappointments and pitfalls in the field, and highlight key areas that require continued efforts toward improving treatment approaches and rapid biomarkers for monitoring treatment response.",,,,2022-10-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The emergence of hospital- and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) underscores the urgent and unmet need to develop novel, safe, and effective antibiotics against these multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Oxazolidinone antibiotics such as linezolid have excellent oral bioavailability and provide coverage against MRSA infections. However, their widespread and long-term use is often limited by adverse effects, especially myelosuppression. TBI-223 is a novel oxazolidinone with potentially reduced myelosuppression, compared to linezolid, but its efficacy against MRSA infections is unknown. Therefore, the preclinical efficacy of TBI-223 (80 and 160 mg/kg twice daily) was compared with that of linezolid (40 and 80 mg/kg twice daily) and sham treatment in mouse models of MRSA bacteremia, skin wound infection, and orthopedic-implant-associated infection. The dosage was selected based on mouse pharmacokinetic analysis of both linezolid and TBI-223, as well as measurement of the MICs. In all three models, TBI-223 and linezolid had comparable dose-dependent efficacies in reducing bacterial burden and disease severity, compared with sham-treated control mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that TBI-223 represents a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic that may provide an additional option against MRSA infections. Future studies in larger animal models and clinical trials are warranted to translate these findings to humans. ",,,,2022-09-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In the present study, we compared the efficacy in three murine TB models of an all-oral drug-resistant TB drug regimen of TBI-166 with bedaquiline (BDQ) and pyrazinamide (PZA) with the first-line regimen of isoniazid (INH) with rifampin (RFP) and PZA (HRZ regimen), the most effective reported TBI-166-containing regimen of TBI-166 with BDQ and linezolid (LZD), and the Nix-TB clinical trial regimen of BDQ with pretomanid and LZD (BPaL regimen). In the C3HeB/FeJ murine TB model, for the TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen, the lungs of mice were culture negative at 4 weeks, and there were no relapses at 8 weeks of treatment. The reduction in bacterial burden and relapse rate were greater than those of the HRZ regimen and the TBI-166+BDQ+LZD regimen. Compared with the BPaL regimen, the TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen had similar or stronger early bactericidal activity, bactericidal activity, and sterilizing activity in the BALB/c murine TB model. The bacterial burden in the TBI-166+BDQ+PZA regimen group decreased significantly more than that in the BPaL regimen group and was almost or totally relapse free (<13.33% after 8 weeks). In conclusion, oral short-course three-drug regimens, including TBI-166 with high efficacy, were identified.

Long, complex treatment regimens coupled with frequent adverse events have resulted in poor treatment adherence and patient outcomes. Smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer national TB programmes an appealing platform to improve patient care and management; however, clinical trial evidence to support their use is lacking. This trial will test the hypothesis that an mHealth intervention can improve treatment success among patients with MDR-TB and is cost-effective compared with standard practice.
A community-based, open-label, parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted among patients treated for MDR-TB in seven provinces of Vietnam. Patients commencing therapy for microbiologically confirmed rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the past 30 days will be recruited to the study. Participants will be individually randomised to an intervention arm, comprising use of an mHealth application for treatment support, or a 'standard care' arm. In both arms, patients will be managed by the national TB programme according to current national treatment guidelines. The primary outcome measure of effectiveness will be the proportion of patients with treatment success (defined as treatment completion and/or bacteriological cure) after 24 months. A marginal Poisson regression model estimated via a generalised estimating equation will be used to test the effect of the intervention on treatment success. A prospective microcosting of the intervention and within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will also be undertaken from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness will be presented as an incremental cost per patient successfully treated and an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
Ethical approval for the study was granted by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2019/676).
Study findings will be disseminated to participants and published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings.

Some drugs are associated with improved outcome. It is unknown whether particular pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships predict outcome.
Adults with pulmonary RR/MDR-TB in Tanzania, Bangladesh, and the Russian Federation receiving local regimens were enrolled from June 2016 to July 2018. Serum was collected after 2, 4, and 8 weeks for each drug's area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC0-24). Quantitative susceptibility of the M. tuberculosis isolate was measured by minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Individual drug AUC0-24/MIC targets were assessed by adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for favorable treatment outcome, and hazard ratios (HRs) for time to sputum culture conversion. K-means clustering algorithm separated the cohort of the most common multidrug regimen into 4 clusters by AUC0-24/MIC exposures.
Among 290 patients, 62 (21%) experienced treatment failure, including 30 deaths. Moxifloxacin AUC0-24/MIC target of 58 was associated with favorable treatment outcome (OR, 3.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-11.56; P = .022); levofloxacin AUC0-24/MIC of 118.3, clofazimine AUC0-24/MIC of 50.5, and pyrazinamide AUC0-24 of 379 mg × h/L were associated with faster culture conversion (HR >1.0, P < .05).

TB-PRACTECAL is an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase II/III non-inferiority trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 24-week regimens containing bedaquiline and pretomanid to treat rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Conducted in Uzbekistan, South Africa and Belarus, patients aged 15 and above with rifampicin-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and requiring a new course of therapy were eligible for inclusion irrespective of HIV status. In the first stage, equivalent to a phase IIB trial, patients were randomly assigned one of four regimens, stratified by site. Investigational regimens include oral bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid. Additionally, two of the regimens also included moxifloxacin (arm 1) and clofazimine (arm 2) respectively. Treatment was administered under direct observation for 24 weeks in investigational arms and 36 to 96 weeks in the standard of care arm. The second stage of the study was equivalent to a phase III trial, investigating the safety and efficacy of the most promising regimen/s. The primary outcome was the percentage of unfavourable outcomes at 72 weeks post-randomisation. This was a composite of early treatment discontinuation, treatment failure, recurrence, lost-to-follow-up and death. The study is being conducted in accordance with ICH-GCP and full ethical approval was obtained from Médecins sans Frontières ethical review board, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ethical review board as well as ERBs and regulatory authorities at each site.
TB-PRACTECAL is an ambitious trial using adaptive design to accelerate regimen assessment and bring novel treatments that are effective and safe to patients quicker. The trial took a patient-centred approach, adapting to best practice guidelines throughout recruitment. The implementation faced significant challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was terminated early for efficacy on the advice of the DSMB and will report on data collected up to the end of recruitment and, additionally, the planned final analysis at 72 weeks after the end of recruitment.

We aimed to investigate the relationships between the drugs' plasma concentrations and the prolongation of observed QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and to evaluate their combined effects on QTcF, using a model-based population approach. Furthermore, we predicted the safety profiles of once daily regimens. Data were obtained from a trial where participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive delamanid, bedaquiline, or delamanid + bedaquiline. The effect on QTcF of delamanid and/or its metabolite (DM-6705) and the pharmacodynamic interactions under coadministration were explored based on a published model between bedaquiline's metabolite (M2) and QTcF. The metabolites of each drug were found to be responsible for the drug-related QTcF prolongation. The final drug-effect model included a competitive interaction between M2 and DM-6705 acting on the same cardiac receptor and thereby reducing each other's apparent potency, by 28% (95% confidence interval (CI), 22-40%) for M2 and 33% (95% CI, 24-54%) for DM-6705. The generated combined effect was not greater but close to ""additivity"" in the analyzed concentration range. Predictions with the final model suggested a similar QT prolonging potential with simplified, once-daily dosing regimens compared with the approved regimens, with a maximum median change from baseline QTcF increase of 20 milliseconds in both regimens. The concentrations-QTcF relationship of the combination of bedaquiline and delamanid was best described by a competitive binding model involving the two main metabolites.

Similar levels of severe adverse events were reported on both regimens suggesting the need for further research to optimise treatment. Stage 2 of STREAM evaluates two additional short-course regimens, both of which include bedaquiline. Throughout stage 2 of STREAM, new drug choices and a rapidly changing treatment landscape have necessitated changes to the trial's design to ensure it remains ethical and relevant. This paper describes changes to the trial design to ensure that stage 2 continues to answer important questions. These changes include the early closure to recruitment of two trial arms and an adjustment to the definition of the primary endpoint. If the STREAM experimental regimens are shown to be non-inferior or superior to the stage 1 study regimen, this would represent an important contribution to evidence about potentially more tolerable and more efficacious MDR-TB regimens, and a welcome advance for patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and tuberculosis control programmes globally.Trial registration: ISRCTN ISRCTN18148631 .

CBD exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-expressing GN diplococcus (GND) (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Moraxella catarrhalis), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but not against GNB. For most of the GNB studied, our results showed that low concentrations of PB (≤ 2 µg/mL) allow CBD (≤ 4 µg/mL) to exert antibacterial activity against GNB (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii), including PB-resistant GNB. CBD + PB also showed additive and/or synergistic effect against LOS-expressing GND. Time-kill assays results showed that the combination CBD + PB leads to a greater reduction in the number of colony forming units per milliliter compared to CBD and PB alone, at the same concentration used in combination, and the combination CBD + PB was synergistic for all four PB-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates evaluated.

Aside from regulatory, logistic and cost barriers at country level, uptake of the novel agents was complicated by gaps in knowledge for optimal use in clinical practice after initial market approval. The main incentives of the current pharmaceutical research and development paradigm are structured around obtaining regulatory approval, which in turn requires efficacy and safety data generated by clinical trials. Recently completed and ongoing clinical trials did not answer critical questions of how to provide shorter, less toxic treatment DR-TB treatment regimens containing bedaquiline and delamanid and improve patient outcomes. Voluntary generation of evidence that is not part of this process-yet essential from a clinical or policy perspective-has been left to non-sponsor partners and researchers, often without collaborative efforts to improve post-regulatory approval access to life-saving drugs.

Data were analysed with STATAv15 using cross-tabulation for frequency and proportions of known resistance-conferring mutations to injectable agents (IA) and fluoroquinolones (FQ).
Among the eligible participants, 12,993/20,508 (63.4%) were male and median (IQR) age 32 (24-43). A total of 576/20,508 (2.8%) of the M. tuberculosis isolates from participants had resistance to RIF and/or INH. These included; 102/576 (17.7%) single drug-resistant and 474/576 (82.3%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Only 102 patients had test results for FQ of whom 70/102 (68.6%) and 01/102 (0.98%) had resistance-conferring mutations in the gyrA locus and gyrB locus respectively. Among patients with FQ resistance, gyrAD94G 42.6% (30.0-55.9) and gyrA A90V 41.1% (28.6-54.3) mutations were most observed. Only one mutation, E540D was detected in the gyrB locus.

We hypothesized that adherence using electronic dose monitoring (EDM) would identify an antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence threshold for emergent ART resistance and predict treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB and HIV on ART and bedaquiline-containing TB regimens.
A prospective cohort of adults with MDR-TB and HIV on ART and initiating MDR-TB treatment with bedaquiline were enrolled at a public hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (PRAXIS Study). Participants received separate EDM devices that measure adherence to bedaquiline and ART (nevirapine or lopinavir/ritonavir). Adherence was calculated cumulatively over 6 months. Participants were followed through completion of MDR-TB treatment. HIV genome sequencing was performed at baseline and 2 and 6 months on samples with HIV RNA ≥1000 copies/mL.
From November 2016 through February 2018, 198 persons with MDR-TB and HIV were enrolled and followed (median, 17.2 months; interquartile range, 12.2-19.6). Eleven percent had baseline ART resistance mutations, and 7.5% developed emergent ART resistance at 6 months. ART adherence was independently associated with ART resistance and mortality.

Here, two murine models of tuberculosis were used to test whether novel regimens replacing rifapentine and isoniazid with bedaquiline and another drug would maintain or increase the sterilizing activity of the regimen. In BALB/c mice, replacing rifapentine in the PZM backbone with bedaquiline (i.e., BZM) significantly reduced both lung CFU counts after 1 month and the proportion of mice relapsing within 3 months after completing 1.5 months of treatment. The addition of rifabutin to BZM (BZMRb) further increased the sterilizing activity. In the C3HeB/FeJ mouse model characterized by caseating lung lesions, treatment with BZMRb resulted in significantly fewer relapses than PZMH after 2 months of treatment. A regimen combining the new DprE1 inhibitor OPC-167832 and delamanid (BZOD) also had superior bactericidal and sterilizing activity compared to PZM in BALB/c mice and was similar in efficacy to PZMH in C3HeB/FeJ mice. Thus, BZM represents a promising backbone for treatment-shortening regimens. Given the prohibitive drug-drug interactions between bedaquiline and rifampin or rifapentine, the BZMRb regimen represents the best opportunity to combine, in one regimen, the treatment-shortening potential of the rifamycin class with that of BZM and deserves high priority for evaluation in clinical trials.

The primary goal of this study was to evaluate MOX efficacy and toxicity using integrative model-based approaches in MDR-TB patients.
In total, 113 MDR-TB patients from 5 different clinical trials were analyzed for the development of a population pharmacokinetics (PK) model. A final population PK model was merged with a previously developed lung-lesion distribution and QT prolongation model. Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the probability target attainment value based on concentration. An area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based target was identified as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MOX isolated from MDR-TB patients.
The presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increased clearance by 32.7% and decreased the AUC by 27.4%, compared with HIV-negative MDR-TB patients. A daily dose of 800 mg or a 400-mg, twice-daily dose of MOX is expected to be effective in MDR-TB patients with an MIC of ≤0.25 µg/mL, regardless of PK differences resulting from the presence of HIV. The effect of MOX in HIV-positive MDR-TB patients tended to be decreased dramatically from 0.5 µg/mL, in contrast to the findings in HIV-negative patients.

Therefore, there is an imperative to develop novel highly efficient (synthetic) agents against both drug-sensitive-TB and DR-TB. The exploration of various heterocycles as prospective core scaffolds for the discovery, development and optimization of anti-TB drugs remains an intriguing scientific endeavour. Telacebec (Q203; TCB), a molecule containing an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IPA) structural motif, is considered a novel very promising anti-TB agent showing a unique mechanism of action. The compound blocks oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting a mycobacterial respiratory chain due to interference with a specific cytochrome b subunit (QcrB) of transmembrane bc1 menaquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase as an essential component for transporting electrons across the membrane from menaquinol to other specific subunit, cytochrome c (QcrC). Thus, the ability of mycobacteria to synthesize adenosine-5´-triphosphate is limited and energy generating machinery is disabled. The TCB molecule effectively fights drug-susceptible, MDR as well as XDR M. tuberculosis strains. The article briefly explains a mechanism of an anti-TB action related to the compounds containing a variously substituted IPA scaffold and is focused on their fundamental structure-anti-TB activity relationships as well. Special consideration is paid to TCB indicating the importance of particular structural fragments for maintaining (or even improving) favourable pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and/or toxicological properties. High lipophilicity of TCB might be regarded as one of the key physicochemical properties with positive impact on anti-TB effect of the drug.

35065702,Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysis.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to human health around the world. Previous publications have estimated the effect of AMR on incidence, deaths, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs for specific pathogen-drug combinations in select locations. To our knowledge, this study presents the most comprehensive estimates of AMR burden to date.
We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations in 204 countries and territories in 2019. We obtained data from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources, covering 471 million individual records or isolates and 7585 study-location-years. We used predictive statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including for locations with no data. Our approach can be divided into five broad components: number of deaths where infection played a role, proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome, proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen, the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest, and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden based on two counterfactuals: deaths attributable to AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by drug-susceptible infections), and deaths associated with AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection). We generated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for out-of-sample predictive validity. We present final estimates aggregated to the global and regional level.
On the basis of our predictive statistical models, there were an estimated 4·95 million (3·62-6·57) deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1·27 million (95% UI 0·911-1·71) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. At the regional level, we estimated the all-age death rate attributable to resistance to be highest in western sub-Saharan Africa, at 27·3 deaths per 100 000 (20·9-35·3), and lowest in Australasia, at 6·5 deaths (4·3-9·4) per 100 000. Lower respiratory infections accounted for more than 1·5 million deaths associated with resistance in 2019, making it the most burdensome infectious syndrome. The six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance (Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were responsible for 929 000 (660 000-1 270 000) deaths attributable to AMR and 3·57 million (2·62-4·78) deaths associated with AMR in 2019. One pathogen-drug combination, meticillin-resistant S aureus, caused more than 100 000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, while six more each caused 50 000-100 000 deaths: multidrug-resistant excluding extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant A baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae.
To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR, as well as an evaluation of the availability of data. AMR is a leading cause of death around the world, with the highest burdens in low-resource settings. Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen-drug combinations contributing to it is crucial to making informed and location-specific policy decisions, particularly about infection prevention and control programmes, access to essential antibiotics, and research and development of new vaccines and antibiotics. There are serious data gaps in many low-income settings, emphasising the need to expand microbiology laboratory capacity and data collection systems to improve our understanding of this important human health threat.

CFZ exhibits complex, context-dependent pharmacokinetics that are characterized by an increasing half-life in long term treatment regimens. The systemic pharmacokinetics of CFZ have been previously represented by a nonlinear, 2-compartment model incorporating an expanding volume of distribution. This expansion reflects the soluble-to-insoluble phase transition that the drug undergoes as it precipitates out and accumulates within macrophages disseminated throughout the organism. Using mice as a model organism, we studied the mechanistic underpinnings of this increasing half-life and how the systemic pharmacokinetics of CFZ are altered with continued dosing.

A narrative review].,"drug-resistant, extensively resistant, mono-resistant, multi-drug resistant, treatment, tuberculosis",Medicina,"Since 2018, important changes in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis have been produced in the light of new evidence. The discovery of new anti-tuberculosis drugs, such as bedaquiline and nitroimidazopirane derivatives, as well as the use of repurposed drugs, led to international organizations to recommend new, totally oral, treatment regimens for mono-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, leaving aside the prolonged use of injectables, with their inherent toxicity and discomfort. Some definitions of drug-resistant tuberculosis have changed. The duration of treatment is also under review, leading some new regimens under study, such as BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid), to a duration similar to that for treating susceptible tuberculosis. In this narrative review, we describe the new definitions, some basic diagnostic aspects, the pharmacological aspects, and the new classification of drugs to be used in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis as well as the currently proposed schemes to treat it available within the Argentinean context. Finally, we include a brief review of ongoing clinical trials on new shortened treatments.

Additionally, rising incidence of treatment resistance threatens the global effort to eradicate this disease. With limited options available, additional novel antibiotics are needed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Telacebec is a first-in-class antibiotic that targets the pathogen's energy metabolism.
This paper provides an overview of the recent progress in the development and testing of telacebec. We discuss published clinical data and examine the design and setup of its clinical trials. We also offer insights on the therapeutic potential of telacebec and aspects of which should be evaluated in the future.
The first phase 2a trial showed a correlation between dosage and bacterial load in patient sputum, which should be confirmed using a direct measurement method such as colony-forming unit counting. Its clinical efficacy, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, low arrhythmogenic risk, and activity against MDR-TB strains make telacebec a suitable candidate for further development. Future clinical testing in combination with approved second-line drugs will reveal its full potential against MDR-TB.

Since 2017, 12 new antibacterial drugs have been approved globally, but only vaborbactam belongs to a new antibacterial class. Also innovative is the cephalosporin derivative cefiderocol, which incorporates an iron-chelating siderophore that facilitates Gram-negative bacteria cell entry. Overall, there were 76 antibacterial agents in clinical development (45 traditional and 31 nontraditional), with 28 in phase 1, 32 in phase 2, 12 in phase 3, and 4 under regulatory evaluation. Forty-one out of 76 (54%) targeted WHO priority pathogens, 16 (21%) were against mycobacteria, 15 (20%) were against C. difficile, and 4 (5%) were nontraditional agents with broad-spectrum effects. Nineteen of the 76 antibacterial agents have new pharmacophores, and 4 of these have new modes of actions not previously exploited by marketed antibacterial drugs. Despite there being 76 antibacterial clinical candidates, this analysis indicated that there were still relatively few clinically differentiated antibacterial agents in late-stage clinical development, especially against critical-priority pathogens.

Therefore, there is an imperative to develop novel highly efficient (synthetic) agents against both drug-sensitive-TB and DR-TB. The exploration of various heterocycles as prospective core scaffolds for the discovery, development and optimization of anti-TB drugs remains an intriguing scientific endeavour. Telacebec (Q203; TCB), a molecule containing an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IPA) structural motif, is considered a novel very promising anti-TB agent showing a unique mechanism of action. The compound blocks oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting a mycobacterial respiratory chain due to interference with a specific cytochrome b subunit (QcrB) of transmembrane bc1 menaquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase as an essential component for transporting electrons across the membrane from menaquinol to other specific subunit, cytochrome c (QcrC). Thus, the ability of mycobacteria to synthesize adenosine-5´-triphosphate is limited and energy generating machinery is disabled. The TCB molecule effectively fights drug-susceptible, MDR as well as XDR M. tuberculosis strains. The article briefly explains a mechanism of an anti-TB action related to the compounds containing a variously substituted IPA scaffold and is focused on their fundamental structure-anti-TB activity relationships as well. Special consideration is paid to TCB indicating the importance of particular structural fragments for maintaining (or even improving) favourable pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and/or toxicological properties. High lipophilicity of TCB might be regarded as one of the key physicochemical properties with positive impact on anti-TB effect of the drug.

The growing costs for diagnosis and management of drug resistance threaten tuberculosis control where the disease is endemic and resources limited. Bacteriophages are viruses that attack bacteria. Phage preparations served as anti-infective agents long before antibiotics were discovered. Though small in size, phages are the most abundant and diverse biological entity on earth. Phages have co-evolved with their hosts and possess all the tools needed to infect and kill bacteria, independent of drug resistance. Modern biotechnology has improved our understanding of the biology of phages and their possible uses. Phage preparations are available to treat meat, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products against parasites or to prevent contamination with human pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus aureus. Such phage-treated products are considered fit for human consumption. A number of recent case reports describe in great detail the successful treatment of highly drug-resistant infections with individualized phage preparations. Formal clinical trials with standardized products are slowly emerging. With its highly conserved genome and relative paucity of natural phage defence mechanisms Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be a suitable target for phage treatment. A phage cocktail with diverse and strictly lytic phages that kill all lineages of M. tuberculosis, and can be propagated on Mycobacterium smegmatis, has been assembled and is available for the evaluation of optimal dosage and suitable routes of administration for tuberculosis in humans.

34766068,Potential contribution of HIV during first-line tuberculosis treatment to subsequent rifampicin-monoresistant tuberculosis and acquired tuberculosis drug resistance in South Africa: a retrospective molecular epidemiology study.,,The Lancet. Microbe,"South Africa has a high burden of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug-resistant [MDR] tuberculosis), with increasing rifampicin-monoresistant (RMR) tuberculosis over time. Resistance acquisition during first-line tuberculosis treatment could be a key contributor to this burden, and HIV might increase the risk of acquiring rifampicin resistance. We assessed whether HIV during previous treatment was associated with RMR tuberculosis and resistance acquisition among a retrospective cohort of patients with MDR or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.
In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients routinely diagnosed with MDR or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa, between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017. Patient-level data were obtained from a prospective database, complemented by data on previous tuberculosis treatment and HIV from a provincial health data exchange. Stored MDR or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis isolates from patients underwent whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS data were used to infer resistance acquisition versus transmission, by identifying genomically unique isolates (single nucleotide polymorphism threshold of five). Logistic regression analyses were used to assess factors associated with RMR tuberculosis and genomic uniqueness.
The cohort included 2041 patients diagnosed with MDR or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017; of those, 463 (22·7%) with RMR tuberculosis and 1354 (66·3%) with previous tuberculosis treatment. In previously treated patients, HIV positivity during previous tuberculosis treatment versus HIV negativity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·07, 95% CI 1·35-3·18), and three or more previous tuberculosis treatment episodes versus one (1·96, 1·21-3·17) were associated with RMR tuberculosis. WGS data showing MDR or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis were available for 1169 patients; 360 (30·8%) isolates were identified as unique. In previously treated patients, RMR tuberculosis versus MDR tuberculosis (adjusted OR 4·96, 3·40-7·23), HIV positivity during previous tuberculosis treatment (1·71, 1·03-2·84), and diagnosis in 2013-17 (1·42, 1·02-1·99) versus 2008-12, were associated with uniqueness. In previously treated patients with RMR tuberculosis, HIV positivity during previous treatment (adjusted OR 5·13, 1·61-16·32) was associated with uniqueness as was female sex (2·50 [1·18-5·26]).
These data suggest that HIV contributes to rifampicin-resistance acquisition during first-line tuberculosis treatment and that this might be driving increasing RMR tuberculosis over time. Large-scale prospective cohort studies are required to further quantify this risk.

Although no reliable evidence has been found, it is considered that combining chemotherapeutic drugs with Chinese herbs can significantly improves the cure rate and the clinical therapeutic effect.
Multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-PTB, n = 258) patients with Qi-yin deficiency syndrome will be randomly assigned into a treatment group (n = 172) or control/placebo group (n = 86). The treatment group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs combined with Chinese herbs granules (1 + 3 granules), while the control group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs combined with Chinese herbs placebo (1 + 3 placebo granules). In addition, MDR-PTB (n = 312) patients with Yin deficiency lung heat syndrome will be randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 208) or control/placebo (n = 104) group. The treatment group will receive the chemotherapeutic regimen combined with Chinese herbs granules (2 + 4 granules), while the control group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs and Chinese herbs placebo (2 + 4 placebo granules). The primary outcome is cure rate, the secondary outcomes included time to sputum culture conversion, lesion absorption rate and cavity closure rate. BACTEC™ MGIT™ automated mycobacterial detection system will be used to evaluate the M.tb infection and drug resistance. Chi-square test and Cox regression will be conducted with SAS 9.4 Statistical software to analyze the data.
The treatment cycle for MDR-PTB using standardized modern medicine could cause lengthy substantial side effects. Chinese herbs have been used for many years to treat MDR-PTB, but are without high-quality evidence. Hence, it is unknown whether Chinese herbs enhances the clinical therapeutic effect of synthetic drugs for treating MDR-PTB. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate the clinical therapeutic effect of combining Chinese herbs and chemotherapeutic drugs to treat MDR-PTB cases. It will assist in screening new therapeutic drugs and establishing treatment plan that aims to improve the clinical therapeutic effect for MDR-PTB patients.

The clinical outcome of TB infection and susceptibility varies among individuals and even among different populations, contributed by host genetic factors such as polymorphism in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as well as in cytokine genes, nutritional differences between populations, immunometabolism, and other environmental factors. Till now, BCG is the only vaccine available to prevent TB but the protection rendered by BCG against pulmonary TB is not uniform. To deliver a vaccine which can give consistent protection against TB is a great challenge with rising burden of drug-resistant TB. Thus, expectations are quite high with new generation vaccines that will improve the efficiency of BCG without showing any discordance for all forms of TB, effective for individual of all ages in all parts of the world. In order to enhance or improve the efficacy of BCG, different strategies are being implemented by considering the immunogenicity of various Mtb virulence factors as well as of the recombinant strains, co-administration with adjuvants and use of appropriate vehicle for delivery. This chapter discusses several such pre-clinical attempts to boost BCG with subunit vaccines tested in murine models and also highlights various recombinant TB vaccines undergoing clinical trials. Promising candidates include new generation of live recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccines, VPM1002, which are deleted in one or two virulence genes.

However, exposure-safety relationships must be explored to extend the use of BDQ. Two reported safety findings for BDQ are prolongation of the QTc interval and elevation of transaminase levels. In this study, we investigated the potential relationships between BDQ and/or its main metabolite (M2) pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics and QTcF interval or transaminase levels in patients with MDR-TB using the approved dose regimen. Data from 429 patients with MDR-TB from two phase IIb studies were analyzed via nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Individual model-predicted concentrations and summary PK metrics were evaluated, respectively, in the QTcF interval and transaminase level exposure-response models. Investigation of further covariate effects was performed in both models. M2 concentrations were found to be responsible for the drug-related QTcF increase in a model accounting for circadian rhythm patterns, time on study, effect of concomitant medication with QT liability, and patient demographics. Simulations with the final model suggested that doses higher than the approved dose (leading to increased M2 concentrations) are not expected to lead to a critical QTcF interval increase. No exposure-safety relationship could be described with transaminase levels despite previous reports of higher levels in patients treated with BDQ. The developed longitudinal models characterized the role of M2 concentrations in QTc interval prolongation and found no concentration dependency for transaminase level elevation, together suggesting that BDQ exposure at the high end of the observed range may not be associated with a higher risk of safety events.",,,,2021-10-10,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Pharmacovigilance is typically the task of national medicines regulatory agencies (NMRAs), but the active drug safety monitoring and management (aDSM) recommended for the new TB medicines and regimens was introduced through the NTPs. We assessed the strengths and challenges of pharmacovigilance systems in Eswatini, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Tanzania, focusing on their capacity to monitor safety of medicines registered and not registered by the NMRAs for the treatment of DR-TB.
Assessment visits were conducted to all four countries by a multidisciplinary team. We used a pharmacovigilance indicator tool derived from existing tools, interviewed key stakeholders, and visited health facilities where DR-TB patients were treated with new medicines. Assessment results were verified with the local NMRAs and NTPs.

Simulations compared safety outcomes for daily linezolid of 1200 and 600 mg, with and without dose adjustments for toxicity. Severe neuropathy was based on symptom scores from the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen. Severe anemia and thrombocytopenia were defined as ≥ grade 3 adverse events according to the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Disease Adult Toxicity table.
Predicted concentration-time profiles were a major predictor in all toxicodynamic models.

While most MDR/RR-TB patients do not receive treatment, many who do are treated for 18 months or more. A shorter all-oral regimen is currently recommended for only a sub-set of MDR/RR-TB. Its use is only conditionally recommended because of very low-quality evidence underpinning the recommendation. Novel combinations of newer and repurposed drugs bring hope in the fight against MDR/RR-TB, but their use has not been optimized in all-oral, shorter regimens. This has greatly limited their impact on the burden of disease. There is, therefore, dire need for high-quality evidence on the performance of new, shortened, injectable-sparing regimens for MDR-TB which can be adapted to individual patients and different settings.
endTB is a phase III, pragmatic, multi-country, adaptive, randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of shorter treatment regimens containing new drugs for patients with fluoroquinolone-susceptible, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. Study participants are randomized to either the control arm, based on the current standard of care for MDR/RR-TB, or to one of five 39-week multi-drug regimens containing newly approved and repurposed drugs. Study participation in all arms lasts at least 73 and up to 104 weeks post-randomization. Randomization is response-adapted using interim Bayesian analysis of efficacy endpoints. The primary objective is to assess whether the efficacy of experimental regimens at 73 weeks is non-inferior to that of the control. A sample size of 750 patients across 6 arms affords at least 80% power to detect the non-inferiority of at least 1 (and up to 3) experimental regimens, with a one-sided alpha of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 12%, against the control in both modified intention-to-treat and per protocol populations.
The lack of a safe and effective regimen that can be used in all patients is a major obstacle to delivering appropriate treatment to all patients with active MDR/RR-TB. Identifying multiple shorter, safe, and effective regimens has the potential to greatly reduce the burden of this deadly disease worldwide.

Regimens that are available are toxic, may involve injections and take up to 2 years to complete treatment, with success rates as low as 50%. The TB-PRACTECAL trial is evaluating shorter, more tolerable regimens of oral drugs; we detail the substudy within this trial, PRACTECAL-PRO, which aims to evaluate patient experiences and perspectives on treatment, to understand outcomes more fully.
We are conducting a mixed-methods evaluation within both investigational and standard of care arms within the TB-PRACTECAL trial, using sequential quality of life (QoL) surveys and in-depth interviews. Data collection involves the Short Form 12 (SF-12) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), collected at up to four fixed timepoints, from baseline, to up to 12 months later. Healthy volunteers will be surveyed to establish locally relevant controls. We will also purposively sample participants for qualitative data collection and analysis, to provide rich explanation of QoL scores. The study will be implemented in all six TB-PRACTECAL study sites in Uzbekistan, South Africa and Belarus. QoL surveys will be scored and analysed according to SF-12 and SGRQ developers' manuals. Differences between scores at baseline and later timepoints will be evaluated as well as graphical exploration of group score trajectories of investigational and standard of care arms.

Bedaquiline accumulates within cells, but its intracellular pharmacokinetics have not been characterized, which may have implications for dose optimization. We developed a novel assay using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure the intracellular concentrations of bedaquiline and its primary metabolite M2 in patients with RR-TB in South Africa. Twenty-one participants were enrolled and underwent sparse sampling of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at months 1, 2, and 6 of treatment and at 3 and 6 months after bedaquiline treatment completion. Intensive sampling was performed at month 2. We used noncompartmental analysis to describe plasma and intracellular exposures and a population pharmacokinetic model to explore the relationship between plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics and the effects of key covariates. Bedaquiline concentrations from month 1 to month 6 of treatment ranged from 94.7 to 2,540 ng/ml in plasma and 16.2 to 5,478 ng/ml in PBMCs, and concentrations of M2 over the 6-month treatment period ranged from 34.3 to 496 ng/ml in plasma and 109.2 to 16,764 ng/ml in PBMCs. Plasma concentrations of bedaquiline were higher than those of M2, but intracellular concentrations of M2 were considerably higher than those of bedaquiline. In the pharmacokinetic modeling, we estimated a linear increase in the intracellular-plasma accumulation ratio for bedaquiline and M2, reaching maximum effect after 2 months of treatment. The typical intracellular-plasma ratios 1 and 2 months after start of treatment were 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42 to 0.92) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.74 to 1.63) for bedaquiline and 12.4 (95% CI: 8.8 to 17.8) and 22.2 (95% CI: 15.6 to 32.3) for M2.

M. tuberculosis hominis (human strain), M. microti, M. pinnipedii and M. canettii. The other pathogenic strain is M. africanum, which belongs to the M. tuberculosis complex and it is fully virulent for humans. The non-pathogenic strains in the complex may include M. fortuitum and M.smegmatis. Extensive research has been carried out to combat this dangerous disease. World Health Organization proposed Directly Observed Treatment Short-course regimen (DOTS) for the eradication of TB. In addition, the compounds such as TBA-7371, TBI-166, AZD5847 and PBTZ-169 are under clinical trials whereas the recently FDA-approved anti-tubercular drugs are Pretomanid (PA-824), Bedaquiline (TMC207), Linezolid (PNU-100480) and Delamanid (OPC-67683). The early detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis can be permanently cured by DOTS comprising Pyrazinamide (Z), Isoniazid (H), Rifampin (R) and Ethambutol (E). The duration of treatment depends on the viability of the disease. DOTS can target to disrupt the biosynthesis of mycobacterial cell wall proteins expressed by various genes. Overexpression of these genes may produce drug-resistant due to dose misuse or the intake of quality compromised anti-tubercular drug regimen. Therefore, in the present review, there has been a necessity to report the second line anti-tubercular chemotherapeutics to target various proteins which are the building blocks of M. tb cell wall, overexpression of which may produce drug resistance.",,,,2021-07-29,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

While streptomycin was tested as a single agent in the first controlled TB clinical trial, introduction of amikacin and kanamycin into MDR-TB regimens was not preceded by randomized controlled trials. A recent large retrospective meta-analysis revealed that compared with regimens without any injectable drug, amikacin provided modest benefits, and kanamycin was associated with worse outcomes. Although their long-term use can cause irreversible ototoxicity, they remain part of MDR-TB regimens because they have a role in preventing emergence of resistance to other drugs. To quantify the contribution of amikacin and kanamycin to second-line regimens, we applied two-dimensional matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging in large lung lesions, quantified drug exposure in lung and in lesions of rabbits with active TB, and measured the concentrations required to kill or inhibit growth of the resident bacterial populations. Using these metrics, we applied site-of-action pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) concepts and simulated drug coverage in patients' lung lesions. The results provide a pharmacological explanation for the limited clinical utility of both agents and reveal better PK-PD lesion coverage for amikacin than kanamycin, consistent with retrospective data of contribution to treatment success. Together with recent mechanistic studies dissecting antibacterial activity from aminoglycoside ototoxicity, the limited but rapid penetration of streptomycin, amikacin, and kanamycin to the sites of TB disease supports the development of analogs with improved efficacy and tolerability.",,,,2021-07-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Infectious diseases,"To contain multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong subregion needs to be accelerated while current antimalarials remain effective. We evaluated the safety, effectiveness, and potential resistance selection of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine mass drug administration (MDA) in a region with artemisinin resistance in Myanmar.
We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in rural community clusters in Kayin (Karen) state in southeast Myanmar. Malaria prevalence was assessed using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR (uPCR) in villages that were operationally suitable for MDA (villages with community willingness, no other malaria control campaigns, and a population of 50-1200). Villages were eligible to participate if the prevalence of malaria (all species) in adults was greater than 30% or P falciparum prevalence was greater than 10% (or both). Contiguous villages were combined into clusters. Eligible clusters were paired based on P falciparum prevalence (estimates within 10%) and proximity. Community health workers provided routine malaria case management and distributed long-lasting insecticidal bed-nets (LLINs) in all clusters. Randomisation of clusters (1:1) to the MDA intervention group or control group was by public coin-flip. Group allocations were not concealed. Three MDA rounds (3 days of supervised dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine [target total dose 7 mg/kg dihydroartemisinin and 55 mg/kg piperaquine] and single low-dose primaquine [target dose 0·25 mg base per kg]) were delivered to intervention clusters. Parasitaemia prevalence was assessed at 3, 5, 10, 15, 21, 27, and 33 months. The primary outcomes were P falciparum prevalence at months 3 and 10. All clusters were included in the primary analysis. Adverse events were monitored from the first MDA dose until 1 month after the final dose, or until resolution of any adverse event occurring during follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01872702.
Baseline uPCR malaria surveys were done in January, 2015, in 43 villages that were operationally suitable for MDA (2671 individuals). 18 villages met the eligibility criteria. Three villages in close proximity were combined into one cluster because a border between them could not be defined. This gave a total of 16 clusters in eight pairs. In the intervention clusters, MDA was delivered from March 4 to March 17, from March 30 to April 10, and from April 27 to May 10, 2015. The weighted mean absolute difference in P falciparum prevalence in the MDA group relative to the control group was -10·6% (95% CI -15·1 to -6·1; p=0·0008) at month 3 and -4·5% (-10·9 to 1·9; p=0·14) at month 10. At month 3, the weighted P falciparum prevalence was 1·4% (0·6 to 3·6; 12 of 747) in the MDA group and 10·6% (7·0 to 15·6; 56 of 485) in the control group. Corresponding prevalences at month 10 were 3·2% (1·5 to 6·8; 34 of 1013) and 5·8% (2·5 to 12·9; 33 of 515). Adverse events were reported for 151 (3·6%) of 4173 treated individuals. The most common adverse events were dizziness (n=109) and rash or itching (n=20). No treatment-related deaths occurred.
In this low-transmission setting, the substantial reduction in P falciparum prevalence resulting from support of community case management was accelerated by MDA. In addition to supporting community health worker case management and LLIN distribution, malaria elimination programmes should consider using MDA to reduce P falciparum prevalence rapidly in foci of higher transmission.

This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants' discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue. Through discursive formations, these revealed the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Considering the complexity involved in the dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, advancing in terms of equity in health, that is, in reducing unjust differences, is a challenge for public policies, especially at the current moment in Brazil, which is of accentuated economic, political and social crisis. The importance of psychosocial stressors and the lack of social support should also be highlighted as intermediary determinants of health. The study has also shown the situation of COVID-19, which consists of an important barrier for patients seeking care.

AaRSs have become a hot target in antimicrobial research. Three aaRS inhibitors are already in clinical practice; antibacterial mupirocin inhibits the synthetic site of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, antifungal tavaborole inhibits the editing site of leucyl-tRNA synthetase, and antiprotozoal halofuginone inhibits proline-tRNA synthetase. According to the World Health Organization, tuberculosis globally remains the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. The rising incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is alarming and urges the search for new antimycobacterial compounds, preferably with yet unexploited mechanism of action. In this literature review, we have covered the up-to-date state in the field of inhibitors of mycobacterial aaRSs. The most studied aaRS in mycobacteria is LeuRS with at least four structural types of inhibitors, followed by TyrRS and AspRS. Inhibitors of MetRS, LysRS, and PheRS were addressed in a single significant study each. In many cases, the enzyme inhibition activity translated into micromolar or submicromolar inhibition of growth of mycobacteria. The most promising aaRS inhibitor as an antimycobacterial compound is GSK656 (compound 8), the only aaRS inhibitor in clinical trials (Phase IIa) for systemic use against tuberculosis.

We investigated the epidemiologic impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of hypothetical novel prophylactic prevention of disease TB vaccines on RR/MDR-TB in China and India.
We constructed a deterministic, compartmental, age-, drug-resistance- and treatment history-stratified dynamic transmission model of tuberculosis. We introduced novel vaccines from 2027, with post- (PSI) or both pre- and post-infection (P&PI) efficacy, conferring 10 years of protection, with 50% efficacy. We measured vaccine cost-effectiveness over 2027-2050 as USD/DALY averted-against 1-times GDP/capita, and two healthcare opportunity cost-based (HCOC), thresholds. We carried out scenario analyses.
By 2050, the P&PI vaccine reduced RR/MDR-TB incidence rate by 71% (UI: 69-72) and 72% (UI: 70-74), and the PSI vaccine by 31% (UI: 30-32) and 44% (UI: 42-47) in China and India, respectively. In India, we found both USD 10 P&PI and PSI vaccines cost-effective at the 1-times GDP and upper HCOC thresholds and P&PI vaccines cost-effective at the lower HCOC threshold. In China, both vaccines were cost-effective at the 1-times GDP threshold. P&PI vaccine remained cost-effective at the lower HCOC threshold with 49% probability and PSI vaccines at the upper HCOC threshold with 21% probability.

New efficient regimens for MDR-TB have obtained high treatment success rates. However, those regimens without drug susceptibility testing (DST) are also likely to contribute to the emergence of resistance. Precision treatments guided by DST might optimize the patients' treatment outcome individually and minimize resistance amplification.
TB-TRUST is a phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial of non-inferiority comparing the treatment success rate between the World Health Organization (WHO) shorter regimen and the refined ultra-short regimen for fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs susceptible rifampicin-resistant TB. The control arm uses the WHO injectable-containing shorter regimen for 36-44 weeks depending on time of sputum smear conversion. The investigational arm uses a refined ultra-short regimen guided by molecular DST to pyrazinamide via whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to optimize the treatment of pyrazinamide-susceptible patients with levofloxacin, linezolid, cycloserine and pyrazinamide for 24-32 weeks and pyrazinamide-resistant with levofloxacin, linezolid, cycloserine and clofazimine for 36-44 weeks. The primary outcome is the treatment success rate without relapse at 84 weeks after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes include the time of sputum culture conversion and occurrence of adverse events. Assuming α = 0.025 level of significance (one-sided test), a power of 80%, a < 10% difference in treatment success rate between control arm and investigational (80% vs. 82%), and a 5% lost follow-up rate, the number of participants per arm to show non-inferiority was calculated as 177(354 in total).
Rapid molecular testing distinguishes patients who are eligible for shorter regimen with fluoroquinolone and the WGS-guided results shorten the treatment to 6 months for pyrazinamide susceptible patients. It's foreseeable that not only novel developed medicines, but also traditional powerful medicines with the susceptibility confirmed by DST are the key factors to ensure the effect of anti-MDR-TB drugs. As a DST-guided precision treatment, TB-TRUST are expected to optimize therapy outcome in more patients who cannot afford the expensive new medicines and minimize and even avoid resistance amplification with the rational use of anti-TB drugs.

Infectious diseases,"Bedaquiline and delamanid are the first drugs of new classes registered for tuberculosis treatment in 40 years. Each can prolong the QTc interval, with maximum effects occurring weeks after drug initiation. The cardiac safety and microbiological activity of these drugs when co-administered are not well-established. Our aim was to characterise the effects of bedaquiline, delamanid, or both on the QTc interval, longitudinally over 6 months of multidrug treatment, among patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis taking multidrug background therapy.
ACTG A5343 is a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial in which adults with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis receiving multidrug background treatment were randomly assigned 1:1:1 by centrally, computer-generated randomisation, by means of permuted blocks to receive bedaquiline, delamanid, or both for 24 weeks. Participants were enrolled at TASK in Cape Town and the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative in Worcester, both in South Africa, and Hospital Maria Auxiliadora in Peru. Individuals with QTc greater than 450 ms were excluded. HIV-positive participants received dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy. Clofazimine was disallowed, and levofloxacin replaced moxifloxacin. ECG in triplicate and sputum cultures were done fortnightly. The primary endpoint was mean QTcF change from baseline (averaged over weeks 8-24); cumulative culture conversation at week 8-24 was an exploratory endpoint. Analyses included all participants who initiated study tuberculosis treatment (modified intention-to-treat population). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02583048 and is ongoing.
Between Aug 26, 2016 and July 13, 2018, of 174 screened, 84 participants (28 in each treatment group, and 31 in total with HIV) were enrolled. Two participants did not initiate study treatment (one in the delamanid group withdrew consent and one in the bedaquiline plus delamanid group) did not meet the eligibility criterion). Mean change in QTc from baseline was 12·3 ms (95% CI 7·8-16·7; bedaquiline), 8·6 ms (4·0-13·1; delamanid), and 20·7 ms (16·1-25·3) (bedaquiline plus delamanid). There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse QTc prolongation events and no deaths during study treatment. Cumulative culture conversion by week 8 was 21 (88%) of 24 (95% CI 71-97; bedaquiline), 20 (83%) of 24 (65-95; delamanid), and 19 (95%) of 20 (79-100; bedaquiline plus delamanid) and was 92% (77-99) for bedaquiline, 91% (76-99), for delamanid, and 95% (79-100) for bedaquiline plus delamanid at 24 weeks.
Combining bedaquiline and delamanid has a modest, no more than additive, effect on the QTc interval, and initial microbiology data are encouraging. This study provides supportive evidence for use of these agents together in patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis with normal baseline QTc values.

To explore the feasibility and acceptability of a non-specialist health worker-delivered 4-session brief motivational interviewing and relapse prevention (MI-RP) intervention for problem substance use and to obtain preliminary data on the effects of this intervention on substance use severity, depressive symptoms, psychological distress and functional impairment at 3 months after hospital discharge.
Between December 2015 and October 2016, consenting MDR-TB patients admitted to Brewelskloof Hospital who screened at moderate to severe risk for substance-related problems on the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) were enrolled, and a baseline questionnaire administered. In the 4 weeks prior to planned discharge, trained counsellors delivered the MI-RP intervention. The baseline questionnaire was re-administered 3 months post-discharge and qualitative interviews were conducted with a randomly selected sample of participants (n = 10).
Sixty patients were screened: 40 (66%) met inclusion criteria of which 39 (98%) were enrolled. Of the enrolled patients, 26 (67%) completed the counselling sessions and the final assessment. Qualitative interviews revealed participants' perceptions of the value of the intervention. From baseline to follow-up, patients reported reductions in substance use severity, symptoms of depression, distress and functional impairment.
In this feasibility study, participant retention in the study was moderate.

However, for the treatment and diagnosis of various lung diseases, such as pneumonia, asthma, cancer, and pulmonary tuberculosis, are becoming increasingly challenging. Currently, several types of treatments and/or diagnostic methods are used to treat lung diseases; however, the occurrence of adverse reactions to chemotherapy, drug-resistant bacteria, side effects that can be significantly toxic, and poor drug delivery necessitates the development of more promising treatments. Nanotechnology, as an emerging technology, has been extensively studied in medicine. Several studies have shown that nano-delivery systems can significantly enhance the targeting of drug delivery. When compared to traditional delivery methods, several nanoparticle delivery strategies are used to improve the detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Transporting nanoparticles to the lungs, loading appropriate therapeutic drugs, and the incorporation of intelligent functions to overcome various lung barriers have broad prospects as they can aid in locating target tissues and can enhance the therapeutic effect while minimizing systemic side effects. In addition, as a new and highly contagious respiratory infection disease, COVID-19 is spreading worldwide. However, there is no specific drug for COVID-19. Clinical trials are being conducted in several countries to develop antiviral drugs or vaccines. In recent years, nanotechnology has provided a feasible platform for improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, nanotechnology-based strategies may have broad prospects in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Cross-sectional and cohort studies using non-respiratory specimens. Forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis: tuberculous meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, disseminated tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture and a study-defined composite reference standard (tuberculosis detection); phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and line probe assays (rifampicin resistance detection).
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and applicability using QUADAS-2. For tuberculosis detection, we performed separate analyses by specimen type and reference standard using the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% credible intervals (CrIs). We applied a latent class meta-analysis model to three forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE.
69 studies: 67 evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF and 11 evaluated Xpert Ultra, of which nine evaluated both tests. Most studies were conducted in China, India, South Africa, and Uganda. Overall, risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains, and low (49%) or unclear (43%) for the reference standard domain. Applicability for the patient selection domain was unclear for most studies because we were unsure of the clinical settings. Cerebrospinal fluid Xpert Ultra (6 studies) Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 89.4% (79.1 to 95.6) (89 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 91.2% (83.2 to 95.7) (386 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculous meningitis, 168 would be Xpert Ultra-positive: of these, 79 (47%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives) and 832 would be Xpert Ultra-negative: of these, 11 (1%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives). Xpert MTB/RIF (30 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 71.1% (62.8 to 79.1) (571 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 96.9% (95.4 to 98.0) (2824 participants; high-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculous meningitis, 99 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive: of these, 28 (28%) would not have tuberculosis; and 901 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative: of these, 29 (3%) would have tuberculosis. Pleural fluid Xpert Ultra (4 studies) Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 75.0% (58.0 to 86.4) (158 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 87.0% (63.1 to 97.9) (240 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have pleural tuberculosis, 192 would be Xpert Ultra-positive: of these, 117 (61%) would not have tuberculosis; and 808 would be Xpert Ultra-negative: of these, 25 (3%) would have tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/RIF (25 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against culture were 49.5% (39.8 to 59.9) (644 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 98.9% (97.6 to 99.7) (2421 participants; high-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have pleural tuberculosis, 60 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive: of these, 10 (17%) would not have tuberculosis; and 940 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative: of these, 50 (5%) would have tuberculosis. Lymph node aspirate Xpert Ultra (1 study) Xpert Ultra sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) against composite reference standard were 70% (51 to 85) (30 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 100% (92 to 100) (43 participants; low-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have lymph node tuberculosis, 70 would be Xpert Ultra-positive and 0 (0%) would not have tuberculosis; 930 would be Xpert Ultra-negative and 30 (3%) would have tuberculosis. Xpert MTB/RIF (4 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity against composite reference standard were 81.6% (61.9 to 93.3) (377 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 96.4% (91.3 to 98.6) (302 participants; low-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have lymph node tuberculosis, 118 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive and 37 (31%) would not have tuberculosis; 882 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative and 19 (2%) would have tuberculosis. In lymph node aspirate, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity against culture was 86.2% (78.0 to 92.3), lower than that against a composite reference standard. Using the latent class model, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled specificity was 99.5% (99.1 to 99.7), similar to that observed with a composite reference standard. Rifampicin resistance Xpert Ultra (4 studies) Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% (95.1 to 100.0), (24 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 100.0% (99.0 to 100.0) (105 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 100 would be Xpert Ultra-positive (resistant): of these, zero (0%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 900 would be Xpert Ultra-negative (susceptible): of these, zero (0%) would have rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF (19 studies) Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 96.5% (91.9 to 98.8) (148 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 99.1% (98.0 to 99.7) (822 participants; high-certainty evidence). Of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin resistance, 105 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive (resistant): of these, 8 (8%) would not have rifampicin resistance; and 895 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative (susceptible): of these, 3 (0.3%) would have rifampicin resistance.
Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF may be helpful in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens: while for most specimens specificity is high, the tests rarely yield a positive result for people without tuberculosis. For tuberculous meningitis, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity than Xpert MTB/RIF against culture. Xpert Ultra and Xpert MTB/RIF had similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance. Future research should acknowledge the concern associated with culture as a reference standard in paucibacillary specimens and consider ways to address this limitation.",,,,2021-01-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Barriers include a propensity for drug resistance with monotherapy, practical limits on numbers of treatment arms for component dose combinations, and limited application of current dose selection methods to multidrug regimens. A multi-objective optimization approach to dose selection was developed as a conceptual and computational framework for currently evolving approaches to clinical testing of novel TB regimens. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling was combined with an evolutionary algorithm to identify dosage regimens that yield optimal trade-offs between multiple conflicting therapeutic objectives. The phase IIa studies for pretomanid, a newly approved nitroimidazole for specific cases of highly drug-resistant pulmonary TB, were used to demonstrate the approach with Pareto optimized dosing that best minimized sputum bacillary load and the probability of drug-related adverse events. Results include a population-typical characterization of the recommended 200 mg once daily dosage, the optimality of time-dependent dosing, examples of individualized therapy, and the determination of optimal loading doses. The approach generalizes conventional PK-PD target attainment to a design problem that scales to drug combinations, and provides a benefit-risk context for clinical testing of complex drug regimens.",,,,2021-01-14,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Newer treatments are needed that could offer simplified regimens with activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant bacilli, while optimizing safety. Pretomanid (PA-824), a nitroimidazooxazine compound, is a new drug for the treatment of pulmonary TB that was recently approved in the United States and Europe in the context of a regimen combined with bedaquiline and linezolid. This phase 1 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study specifically examined the effect of single-dose administration of pretomanid 400 or 1000 mg and pretomanid 400 mg plus moxifloxacin 400 mg on the QTc interval in 74 healthy subjects. Subjects were fasting at the time of drug administration. Pretomanid concentrations following single 400- or 1000-mg doses were not associated with any QT interval prolongation of clinical concern. Moxifloxacin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of pretomanid, and the effect of pretomanid 400 mg plus moxifloxacin 400 mg on the individually corrected QT interval was consistent with the effect of moxifloxacin alone. Both drugs were generally well tolerated.

STREAM is the first randomised controlled trial with an economical evaluation to compare all-oral and injectable-containing 9-11-month MDR-TB treatment regimens.
Health system costs of delivering a 9-month injectable-containing regimen and a 9-month all-oral bedaquiline-containing regimen will be collected in Ethiopia, India, Moldova and Uganda, using 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' costing approaches. Patient costs will be collected using questionnaires that have been developed based on the STOP-TB questionnaire. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the cost utility of the two regimens, from a health system perspective. Secondary objectives include estimating the cost utility from a societal perspective as well as evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the regimens, using both health system and societal perspectives. The effect measure for the cost-utility analysis will be the quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while the effect measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the efficacy outcome from the clinical trial.

Respiratory medicine,"A therapeutic vaccine that prevents recurrent tuberculosis would be a major advance in the development of shorter treatment regimens. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the ID93 + GLA-SE vaccine at various doses and injection schedules in patients with previously treated tuberculosis.
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial was conducted at three clinical sites near Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were recruited at local clinics after receiving 4 months of tuberculosis treatment, and screened for eligibility after providing written informed consent. Participants were aged 18-60 years, BCG-vaccinated, HIV-uninfected, and diagnosed with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Eligible patients had completed standard treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis in the past 28 days. Participants were enrolled after completing standard treatment and randomly assigned sequentially to receive vaccine or placebo in three cohorts: 2 μg intramuscular ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 (cohort 1); 10 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 (cohort 2); 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 and placebo on day 28 (cohort 3); 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE on days 0, 28, and 56 (cohort 3); or placebo on days 0 and 56 (cohorts 1 and 2), with the placebo group for cohort 3 receiving an additional injection on day 28. Randomisation was in a ratio of 3:1 for ID93 + GLA-SE and saline placebo in cohorts 1 and 2, and in a ratio of 3:3:1 for (2 ×) ID93 + GLA-SE, (3 ×) ID93 + GLA-SE, and placebo in cohort 3. The primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity (vaccine-specific antibody response and T-cell response). For the safety outcome, participants were observed for 30 min after each injection, injection site reactions and systemic adverse events were monitored until day 84, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest were monitored for 6 months after the last injection. Vaccine-specific antibody responses were measured by serum ELISA, and T-cell responses after stimulation with vaccine antigens were measured in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02465216.
Between June 17, 2015, and May 30, 2016, we assessed 177 patients for inclusion. 61 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive: saline placebo (n=5) or (2 ×) 2 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE (n=15) on days 0 and 56 (cohort 1); saline placebo (n=2) or (2 ×) 10 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE (n=5) on days 0 and 56 (cohort 2); saline placebo (n=5) on days 0, 28 and 56, or 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE (n=15) on days 0 and 56 and placebo injection on day 28, or (3 ×) 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE (n=14) on days 0, 28, and 56 (cohort 3). ID93 + GLA-SE induced robust and durable antibody responses and specific, polyfunctional CD4 T-cell responses to vaccine antigens. Two injections of the 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE dose induced antigen-specific IgG and CD4 T-cell responses that were significantly higher than those with placebo and persisted for the 6-month study duration. Mild to moderate injection site pain was reported after vaccination across all dose combinations, and induration and erythema in patients given 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE in two or three doses. One participant had grade 3 erythema and induration at the injection site. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed.
Vaccination with ID93 + GLA-SE was safe and immunogenic for all tested regimens. These data support further evaluation of ID93 + GLA-SE in therapeutic vaccination strategies to improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes.

Global burdens of drug-resistant TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens have a particular impact on paediatric age groups, necessitating a paediatric-focused agenda to address emerging resistance. Dedicated approaches are needed to find, successfully treat and prevent resistant infections in paediatric populations worldwide. Challenges include the diagnosis and identification of resistant infections, limited access to novel antimicrobials or to paediatric-friendly formulations, limited access to research and clinical trials and implementation challenges related to prevention and successful completion of treatment. In this review, the particular complexities of emerging resistance in TB, HIV and gram-negative pathogens in children, with attention to both clinical and public health challenges, are highlighted. Key principles of a paediatric-focused agenda to address antimicrobial resistance are outlined. They include quality of care, increasing equitable access to key diagnostics, expanding antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention across global settings, and health system strengthening. Increased access to research studies, including clinical trials, is needed. Further study and implementation of care models and strategies for child- or adolescent-centred management of infections such as HIV and TB can critically improve outcome and avoid development of resistance.

In November 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened an independent international expert panel to review new evidence on the treatment of multidrug- (MDR) and rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.Updated WHO guidelines emerging from this review, published in June 2020, recommend a shorter treatment regimen for patients with MDR/RR-TB not resistant to fluoroquinolones (of 9-11 months), with the inclusion of bedaquiline instead of an injectable agent, making the regimen all oral. For patients with MDR-TB and additional fluoroquinolone resistance, a regimen composed of bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid may be used under operational research conditions (6-9 months). Depending on the drug-resistance profile, extent of TB disease or disease severity, a longer (18-20 months) all-oral, individualised treatment regimen may be used. In addition, the review of new data in 2019 allowed the WHO to conclude that there are no major safety concerns on the use of bedaquiline for >6 months' duration, the use of delamanid and bedaquiline together and the use of bedaquiline during pregnancy, although formal recommendations were not made on these topics.The 2020 revision has highlighted the ongoing need for high-quality evidence and has reiterated the need for clinical trials and other research studies to contribute to the development of evidence-based policy.",,,,2020-11-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We aimed to explore patients' viewpoints and experiences with personal and socio-behavioral obstacles from MDR-TB diagnosis to treatment in an attempt to understand these prior findings.
The study was conducted in December 2016 with MDR-TB patients admitted at Kibong'oto Infectious Diseases Hospital. A qualitative approach deploying focus group discussions (FGDs) was used to gather information. Groups were sex aggregated to allow free interaction and to gauge gender specific issues in the social and behavioral contexts. The FGDs explored pathways and factors in the service delivery that may have contributed in the delay in accessing MDR-TB diagnostics and/or treatment. Collected data were coded, categorized and thematically interpreted.
Forty MDR-TB patients participated in six FGDs. Challenges and barriers contributing to the delay in accessing MDR-TB diagnosis to treatment were as follows: 1) Participants had a different understanding of MDR-TB that led to seeking services outside the conventional health system; 2) Socio-economic adversity made health-seeking behavior difficult and often unproductive; 3) In the health system, challenges included inadequacy of MDR-TB diagnostic centers, lack of knowledge on behalf of health care providers to consider MDR-TB and order appropriate diagnostics; 4) The specimen referral system for early diagnosis of MDR-TB was inefficient. Non-adherence of TB patients to first-line anti-TB drugs prior to MDR-TB diagnosis, given the multitude of barriers discussed, was coupled with both intentional and unintentional non-adherence of health care providers to international standards of TB care.

33143704,Investigation of the efficacy of the short regimen for rifampicin-resistant TB from the STREAM trial.,"Causal inference, Inverse probability of censoring weighting, MDR-TB, Multiple imputation, Non-inferiority, Short regimen, Tuberculosis",BMC medicine,"The STREAM trial demonstrated that a 9-11-month ""short"" regimen had non-inferior efficacy and comparable safety to a 20+ month ""long"" regimen for the treatment of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Imbalance in the components of the composite primary outcome merited further investigation.
Firstly, the STREAM primary outcomes were mapped to alternatives in current use, including WHO programmatic outcome definitions and other recently proposed modifications for programmatic or research purposes. Secondly, the outcomes were re-classified according to the likelihood that it was a Failure or Relapse (FoR) event on a 5-point Likert scale: Definite, Probable, Possible, Unlikely, and Highly Unlikely. Sensitivity analyses were employed to explore the impact of informative censoring. The protocol-defined modified intention-to-treat (MITT) analysis population was used for all analyses.
Cure on the short regimen ranged from 75.1 to 84.2% across five alternative outcomes. However, between-regimens results did not exceed 1.3% in favor of the long regimen (95% CI upper bound 10.1%), similar to the primary efficacy results from the trial. Considering only Definite or Probable FoR events, there was weak evidence of a higher risk of FoR in the short regimen, HR 2.19 (95%CI 0.90, 5.35), p = 0.076; considering only Definite FoR events, the evidence was stronger, HR 3.53 (95%CI 1.05, 11.87), p = 0.030. Cumulative number of grade 3-4 AEs was the strongest predictor of censoring. Considering a larger effect of informative censoring attenuated treatment differences, although 95% CI were very wide.
Five alternative outcome definitions gave similar overall results. The risk of failure or relapse (FoR) may be higher in the short regimen than in the long regimen, highlighting the importance of how loss to follow-up and other censoring is accounted for in analyses. The outcome of time to FoR should be considered as a primary outcome for future drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB treatment trials, provided sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of departures from independent censoring are also included.",,"Cure on the short regimen ranged from 75.1 to 84.2% across five alternative outcomes.

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg) and early initiation (≤3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate. Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONAdministration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment for time-varying confounders.FUNDINGNone.",,,,2020-11-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The final PopPK data set contained 20,483 plasma samples from 744 patients with MDR-TB receiving an optimized background regimen (OBR). Delamanid PK was adequately described for all observed dosing regimens and subpopulations by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination and absorption, an absorption lag time, and decreased relative bioavailability with increasing dose. Relative bioavailabilities of 200-mg and higher doses (250 and 300 mg) were 76% and 58% of a 100-mg dose, respectively. Relative bioavailability was 26% higher after evening doses than morning doses and 9% higher in outpatient settings than inpatient settings. The rate of absorption was higher, and lag time was shorter, following a morning dose than an evening dose. Relative bioavailabilities in patients in Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian regions were 53% and 40% higher, respectively, than in patients in non-Asian regions. Apparent clearance was higher (to the power of -0.892) in patients with hypoalbuminemia (albumin levels of <3.4 g/dl). Coadministration of efavirenz in patients with HIV increased delamanid clearance by 35%. Delamanid exposure was not affected by age (18 to 64 years), mild or moderate renal impairment, anti-TB antibiotic resistance status, HIV status, or markers of hepatic dysfunction or by concomitant administration of OBR, lamivudine, tenofovir, pyridoxine, CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, or antacids.

Furthermore, the costs of treating MDR-TB are much greater than those for treating drug-susceptible TB, both for health service and patient-incurred costs. Urgent action is needed to identify short, effective, tolerable and cheaper treatments for people with both quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant MDR-TB. We present the protocol for an economic evaluation (PRACTECAL-EE substudy) alongside an ongoing clinical trial (TB-PRACTECAL) aiming to assess the costs to patients and providers of new regimens, as well as their cost-effectiveness and impact on participant poverty levels. This substudy is based on data from the three countries participating in the main trial.
Primary cost data will be collected from the provider and patient perspectives, following economic best practice. We will estimate the probability that new MDR-TB regimens containing bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid are cost-effective from a societal perspective as compared with the standard of care for MDR-TB patients in Uzbekistan, South Africa and Belarus. Analysis uses a Markov model populated with primary cost and outcome data collected at each study site. We will also estimate the impact of new regimens on prevalence of catastrophic patient costs due to TB.
Ethical approval has been obtained from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Médecins Sans Frontières. Local ethical approval will be sought in each study site. The results of the economic evaluation will be shared with the country health authorities and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Decaprenylphosphoryl-d-ribose 2'-epimerase (DprE), is important for the growth and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DprE1 is a donor of arabinose sugars which helps in the formation of cell wall components-lipoarabinomannan and arabinogalactan through Decaprenyl-phosphoryl d-arabinose (DPA) pathway. In our study, we have chosen Azaindole derivatives as DprE1 inhibitors which possess non-covalent property. TBA7371 (azaindole derivative, non-covalent inhibitor) is currently in first phase of clinical trials as DprE1 inhibitor. Azaindoles have been found to be equally potent against drug-sensitive and isoniazid/rifampin-resistant strains. Hence, azaindoles are an attractive class for further optimization as potential DprE1 inhibitors for TB. Structure-based pharmacophore model was generated to investigate the compounds with similar molecular features. Compounds having a good fitness score and pharmacophoric features were compared with the molecules in clinical trial and were proceeded for molecular docking studies to identify the binding affinity of the compounds with target protein DprE1. Energy based calculations using Prime MM-GBSA of Schrodinger was further executed to examine free binding energy of the ligands. The prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters (ADME) plays an important role to identify safe and potent molecules which may further have potential to become drug candidates. Induced-fit docking approach and Molecular Dynamics integrated with Prime MM-GBSA calculations of both hit compounds has further confirmed the binding affinity and stability. All the results obtained from our study were interpreted and compared with DprE1 inhibitor in clinical trials.

In addition to the originator pharmaceutical company, Janssen, a range of governmental and non-profit entities have contributed to the development of bedaquiline.
We identified various avenues of public investments in the development of bedaquiline: direct funding of clinical trials and a donation programme, tax credits and deductions, and revenues resulting from the priority review voucher (PRV) awarded to the originator. Data on investments were gathered through contact with study leads and/or funders; for non-responses, published average costs were substituted. The originator company's expenses were estimated by similar methods. Tax credits and deductions were calculated based on estimated originator trial costs and donation expenses. The value of the PRV was estimated by application of a published model.
Public contributions through clinical trials funding were estimated at US$109-252 million, tax credits at US$22-36 million, tax deductions at US$8-27 million, administration of a donation programme at US$5 million, PRV revenues at US$300-400 million.

Tuberculosis treatment consists in an intensive phase and a continuation phase. Unfortunately, the appearance of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis, mainly due to low adherence to prescribed therapies or inefficient healthcare structures, requires at least 20 months of treatment with second-line, more toxic and less efficient drugs, i.e., capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin and fluoroquinolones. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for discovery and development of new drugs to reduce the global burden of this disease, including the multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. To this end, many plant species, as well as marine organisms and fungi have been and continue to be used in various traditional healing systems around the world to treat tuberculosis, thus representing a nearly unlimited source of active ingredients. Besides their antimycobacterial activity, natural products can be useful in adjuvant therapy to improve the efficacy of conventional antimycobacterial therapies, to decrease their adverse effects and to reverse mycobacterial multi-drug resistance due to the genetic plasticity and environmental adaptability of Mycobacterium. However, even if some natural products have still been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies, the validation of their efficacy and safety as antituberculosis agents is far from being reached, and, therefore, according to an evidence-based approach, more high-level randomized clinical trials are urgently needed.",,,,2020-09-09,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

As per the World Health Organization (WHO) report of 2019, there were 1.5 million deaths in the year 2018, mainly because of multi- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR & XDR-TB). Among several antitubercular drugs in clinical trials, bedaquiline (TMC207) is a highly promising drug that was approved by the FDA in 2012 and marketed in 2016 for the treatment of multidrug resistant TB in combination with other drugs. Bedaquiline acts on mycobacterial ATP synthase and is highly effective in replicating as well as on dormant mycobacteria. Several series of substituted quinolines have been reported with their antitubercular and ATP synthase inhibitory activity.
To understand the role of physicochemical parameters like hydrophobicity, electronic and steric factors in eliciting the biological response, the Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out using the computed parameters as independent variable and activity (-log IC50/MIC) as the dependent variable.
The developed QSAR models in terms of positively contributing Molar Refractivity (MR) and negatively contributing Partition Coefficient (PC) and Connolly Molecular Area (CMA) parameters have high predictivity as also shown on external data set and the mean value of the computed 3D parameters of enantiomers may be used in QSAR analysis for racemic compounds.
These results are also substantiated by pharmacophore modeling.

Globally, approximately 3.4% of new TB patients and 20% of the patients with a history of previous treatment for TB were diagnosed with MDR-TB. The treatment of MDR-TB requires medications for a long duration (up to 20-24 months) with less effective and toxic second-line drugs and has unfavorable outcomes. However, treatment outcomes are expected to improve due to the introduction of a new agent (bedaquiline), repurposed drugs (linezolid, clofazimine, and cycloserine), and technological advancement in rapid drug sensitivity testing.

The emergence of resistance against anti-TB drugs has reached an alarming level in various parts of the world, providing an active platform for the design of new targeted drug delivery. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have an important role in controlling TB pathogenesis. At macrophage activation, ROS that are produced inside macrophages directly kill resident bacteria. These ROS possess a dual character because they can kill macrophages along with the resident bacteria. Targeting these ROS can play a remarkable part in overcoming resistance of conventional drugs. Nanoparticles (NPs) have evolved as a potential drug carrier for targeted delivery and elimination of various resistance mechanisms against antimicrobials. Receptor-mediated targeting of macrophages via different NPs may be a promising strategy for combating drug resistance and enhancing efficacy of old-fashioned antimycobacterial agents.",,,,2020-09-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra are World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid molecular tests that simultaneously detect tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and children with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, at lower health system levels. To inform updated WHO guidelines on molecular assays, we performed a systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in children presumed to have active tuberculosis.
Primary objectives • To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for (a) pulmonary tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (b) tuberculous meningitis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; (c) lymph node tuberculosis in children presumed to have tuberculosis; and (d) rifampicin resistance in children presumed to have tuberculosis - For tuberculosis detection, index tests were used as the initial test, replacing standard practice (i.e. smear microscopy or culture) - For detection of rifampicin resistance, index tests replaced culture-based drug susceptibility testing as the initial test Secondary objectives • To compare the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for each of the four target conditions • To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in accuracy estimates - For tuberculosis detection, we considered age, disease severity, smear-test status, HIV status, clinical setting, specimen type, high tuberculosis burden, and high tuberculosis/HIV burden - For detection of rifampicin resistance, we considered multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis burden • To compare multiple Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra results (repeated testing) with the initial Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra result SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) Registry up to 29 April 2019, without language restrictions.
Randomized trials, cross-sectional trials, and cohort studies evaluating Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children younger than 15 years. Reference standards comprised culture or a composite reference standard for tuberculosis and drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus (molecular assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance) for rifampicin resistance. We included studies evaluating sputum, gastric aspirate, stool, nasopharyngeal or bronchial lavage specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis), cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis), fine needle aspirates, or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis).
Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy - Revised (QUADAS-2). For each target condition, we used the bivariate model to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We stratified all analyses by type of reference standard. We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.
For pulmonary tuberculosis, 299 data sets (68,544 participants) were available for analysis; for tuberculous meningitis, 10 data sets (423 participants) were available; for lymph node tuberculosis, 10 data sets (318 participants) were available; and for rifampicin resistance, 14 data sets (326 participants) were available. Thirty-nine studies (80%) took place in countries with high tuberculosis burden. Risk of bias was low except for the reference standard domain, for which risk of bias was unclear because many studies collected only one specimen for culture. Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis For sputum specimens, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 64.6% (55.3% to 72.9%) (23 studies, 493 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 99.0% (98.1% to 99.5%) (23 studies, 6119 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For other specimen types (nasopharyngeal aspirate, 4 studies; gastric aspirate, 14 studies; stool, 11 studies), Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity ranged between 45.7% and 73.0%, and pooled specificity ranged between 98.1% and 99.6%. For sputum specimens, Xpert Ultra pooled sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) verified by culture were 72.8% (64.7% to 79.6%) (3 studies, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 97.5% (95.8% to 98.5%) (3 studies, 551 participants; high-certainty evidence). For nasopharyngeal specimens, Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) were 45.7% (28.9% to 63.3%) and 97.5% (93.7% to 99.3%) (1 study, 195 participants). For all specimen types, Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra sensitivity were lower against a composite reference standard than against culture. Detection of tuberculous meningitis For cerebrospinal fluid, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 54.0% (95% CI 27.8% to 78.2%) (6 studies, 28 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 93.8% (95% CI 84.5% to 97.6%) (6 studies, 213 participants; low-certainty evidence). Detection of lymph node tuberculosis For lymph node aspirates or biopsies, Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity, verified by culture, were 90.4% (95% CI 55.7% to 98.6%) (6 studies, 68 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 89.8% (95% CI 71.5% to 96.8%) (6 studies, 142 participants; low-certainty evidence). Detection of rifampicin resistance Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (67.6% to 97.5%) (6 studies, 20 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 98.3% (87.7% to 99.8%) (6 studies, 203 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
We found Xpert MTB/RIF sensitivity to vary by specimen type, with gastric aspirate specimens having the highest sensitivity followed by sputum and stool, and nasopharyngeal specimens the lowest; specificity in all specimens was > 98%. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra sensitivity in sputum was higher and specificity slightly lower. Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF was sensitive for diagnosing lymph node tuberculosis. For children with presumed tuberculous meningitis, treatment decisions should be based on the entirety of clinical information and treatment should not be withheld based solely on an Xpert MTB/RIF result. The small numbers of studies and participants, particularly for Xpert Ultra, limits our confidence in the precision of these estimates.",,,,2020-08-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
32790867,Carprofen elicits pleiotropic mechanisms of bactericidal action with the potential to reverse antimicrobial drug resistance in tuberculosis.,,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,"The rise of antimicrobial drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis coupled with the shortage of new antibiotics has elevated TB to a major global health priority. Repurposing drugs developed or used for other conditions has gained special attention in the current scenario of accelerated drug development for several global infectious diseases. In a similar effort, previous studies revealed that carprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, selectively inhibited the growth of replicating, non-replicating and MDR clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis.
We aimed to reveal the whole-cell phenotypic and transcriptomic effects of carprofen in mycobacteria.
Integrative molecular and microbiological approaches such as resazurin microtitre plate assay, high-throughput spot-culture growth inhibition assay, whole-cell efflux inhibition, biofilm inhibition and microarray analyses were performed. Analogues of carprofen were also synthesized and assessed for their antimycobacterial activity.
Carprofen was found to be a bactericidal drug that inhibited mycobacterial drug efflux mechanisms. It also restricted mycobacterial biofilm growth. Transcriptome profiling revealed that carprofen likely acts by targeting respiration through the disruption of membrane potential. The pleiotropic nature of carprofen's anti-TB action may explain why spontaneous drug-resistant mutants could not be isolated in practice.

The knowledge about the molecular diversity of M.tb enables the implementation of more effective surveillance and control measures and, nowadays, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) holds the potential to produce high-resolution epidemiological data in a high-throughput manner. Florianópolis, the state capital of Santa Catarina (SC) in south Brazil, shows a high TB incidence (46.0/100,000). Here we carried out a WGS-based evaluation of the M.tb strain diversity, drug-resistance and ongoing transmission in the capital metropolitan region. Resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin was identified respectively in 4.0% (n = 6), 2.0% (n = 3) and 1.3% (n = 2) of the 151 studied strains by WGS. Besides, resistance to pyrazinamide and ethambutol was detected in 0.7% (n = 1) and reistance to ethionamide and fluoroquinolone (FQ) in 1.3% (n = 2), while a single (0.7%) multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain was identified. SNP-based typing classified all isolates into M.tb Lineage 4, with high proportion of sublineages LAM (60.3%), T (16.4%) and Haarlem (7.9%). The average core-genome distance between isolates was 420.3 SNPs, with 43.7% of all isolates grouped across 22 genomic clusters thereby showing the presence of important ongoing TB transmission events. Most clusters were geographically distributed across the study setting which highlights the need for an urgent interruption of these large transmission chains. The data conveyed by this study shows the presence of important and uncontrolled TB transmission in the metropolitan area and provides precise data to support TB control measures in this region.",,,,2020-08-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences","Tuberculosis remains a global challenge, particularly with a growing number of resistant cases, which may become an obstacle to eliminating this disease. Standardized short-course therapy composed of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA) is playing vital roles for curbing the rapid spread of tuberculosis. However, some patients have poor responses to standardized short-course therapy. As the number of drug-resistant tuberculosis increase, some other anti-tuberculous drugs are needed to achieve better treatment outcomes. In this study, we established a UPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous detection of ten anti-tuberculosis drugs in human plasma including INH, EMB, PZA, RIF, rifampin, rifapentine as well as four second-line antituberculosis drugs, i.e. ethionamide, protionamide, thiosemicarbazone and clofazimine. This study contains almost all the commonly used anti-tuberculosis drugs. The plasma samples were treated with acetonitrile to precipitate proteins, and doped with the isotope internal standard. A Shiseido CAPCELL RAK-ADME (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 3 μm) column was used for chromatographic separation, and acetonitrile-water (containing 0.1% formic acid) was the mobile phase. The separation used gradient elution with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The column temperature was 40 °C, and the sample volume was 1 μL. The electrospray ionization source (ESI) and the positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode were used for the detection. The analysis time was as short as 7 min.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a country with a high burden of TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), but there are no nationally representative data on drug resistance. In 2016-2017, a national survey of TB patients was conducted in 108 microscopy centres across all 11 provinces of the country using innovative molecular approaches. Sputum samples were collected from 1,545 new and 163 previously treated patients. These were tested by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, followed by targeted next-generation sequencing performed directly on sputum. The prevalence of rifampicin resistance was low, at 1.8% (95% CI: 1.0-3.2) among new and 17.3% (95% CI: 11.9-24.4) among previously treated patients. Resistance to pyrazinamide, fluoroquinolones and second-line injectables was also low. The prevalence of resistance to isoniazid among rifampicin-susceptible patients was higher, at 6.6% (95% CI: 4.4-9.8) among new and 8.7% (95% : 3.2-21.2) among previously treated patients. Diagnosing and treating isoniazid-resistant patients remains a challenge, given that many will be missed by the current national diagnostic algorithm that is driven by detecting rifampicin resistance by Xpert MTB/RIF. This is the first nationwide survey incorporating targeted sequencing directly on sputum. It serves as a proof-of-concept for other settings that do yet have rapid specimen transport networks or capacity to conduct culture.",,,,2020-07-03,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Many studies have confirmed the efficacy of the surgical treatment of STB through anterior, anterolateral, posterior debridement, and intervertebral fusion or combined with internal fixation. However, the conventional surgical approach requires extensive exposure of the affected areas with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Recently, minimally invasive surgery has come into use to reduce iatrogenic trauma and relevant complications. Here, we introduced a novel technique for the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine tuberculosis: minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation (MI-FLDPI). In this study, we evaluated the technical feasibility, the clinical outcomes, and the postoperative complications.
We did a prospective, non-randomized study on this new technique. Twenty three patients (13 males) with thoracic or lumbar spine tuberculosis who underwent minimally invasive far lateral debridement and posterior instrumentation were included in the study. The preoperative comorbidities, operation duration, intra-operative hemorrhage, Cobb's angles, and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), neurological recovery, and eradication of tuberculosis. Radiological outcomes were evaluated by changes in Cobb's angle and fusion status of the affected segments.
The patients were followed for an average of 19 months (ranging from 12 to 36 months). At the final follow-up, CRP and ESR of all patients were normal. The VAS and ODI were significantly improved compared with preoperative values (P < 0.05). No evident progression of the kyphotic deformity was found after surgery. Twenty two patients showed spontaneous peripheral interbody fusion 1 year after surgery. There were no failure of the instrumentation even though a young female with drug-resistant tuberculosis showed no sign of interbody fusion at the third year follow-up. All the patients with preoperative neurological deficit showed complete recovery at the final follow-up.

We compared the costs to health systems and participants of long (20 to 22 months) and short (9 to 11 months) MDR tuberculosis regimens in Ethiopia and South Africa. Cost data were collected from participants in the STREAM phase-III randomized controlled trial and we estimated health-system costs using bottom-up and top-down approaches. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by calculating the incremental cost per unfavourable outcome avoided.
Health-care costs per participant in South Africa were 8340.7 United States dollars (US$) with the long and US$ 6618.0 with the short regimen; in Ethiopia, they were US$ 6096.6 and US$ 4552.3, respectively. The largest component of the saving was medication costs in South Africa (67%; US$ 1157.0 of total US$ 1722.8) and social support costs in Ethiopia (35%, US$ 545.2 of total US$ 1544.3). In Ethiopia, trial participants on the short regimen reported lower expenditure for supplementary food (mean reduction per participant: US$ 225.5) and increased working hours (i.e. 667 additional hours over 132 weeks). The probability that the short regimen was cost-effective was greater than 95% when the value placed on avoiding an unfavourable outcome was less than US$ 19 000 in Ethiopia and less than US$ 14 500 in South Africa.
The short MDR tuberculosis treatment regimen was associated with a substantial reduction in health-system costs and a lower financial burden for participants.
Étudier les variations de coût liées à l'adoption d'un traitement court de la tuberculose multirésistante (MR) pour les systèmes de santé et les participants.
Nous avons comparé les coûts pris en charge par les systèmes de santé et les participants pour des schémas thérapeutiques longs (20 à 22 mois) et courts (9 à 11 mois) en Éthiopie et en Afrique du Sud. Les données ont été récoltées auprès des participants à la phase III de l'essai clinique randomisé STREAM, et nous avons estimé les dépenses assumées par les systèmes de santé en utilisant des approches ascendantes et descendantes. Enfin, pour analyser l'efficacité des coûts, nous avons calculé les frais additionnels qu'entraîne chaque issue défavorable évitée.
Les dépenses en soins de santé par participant en Afrique du Sud s'élevaient à 8340,7 dollars américains (US$) avec le traitement long et à 6618,0 US$ avec le traitement court; en Éthiopie, le montant équivalait respectivement à 6096,6 US$ et 4552,3 US$. La principale composante économique en Afrique du Sud était le coût des médicaments (67%, 1157,0 US$ sur un total de 1722,8 US$) tandis qu'en Éthiopie, il s'agissait de l'aide sociale (35%, 545,2 US$, sur un total de 1544,3 US$). En Éthiopie, les participants à l'essai clinique pour le traitement court ont signalé une baisse des dépenses consacrées à l'alimentation complémentaire (réduction moyenne par participant : 225,5 US$) et une hausse des heures de travail (c'est-à-dire 667 heures en plus sur 132 semaines). La probabilité que le traitement court soit plus rentable dépassait les 95% lorsque la valeur accordée aux issues défavorables évitées était inférieure à 19 000 US$ en Éthiopie, et à 14 500 US$ en Afrique du Sud.

Investigar los cambios en los costos para los sistemas sanitarios y los participantes, derivados del cambio a planes de tratamiento a corto plazo para la tuberculosis multirresistente (MDR, por sus siglas en inglés).
Se compararon los costos para los sistemas sanitarios y los participantes de los planes de tratamiento a largo (20 a 22 meses) y a corto plazo (9 a 11 meses) de la tuberculosis en Etiopía y Sudáfrica. Se recopilaron datos sobre los costos de los participantes en el ensayo STREAM fase III, controlado y aleatorizado y se estimaron los costos del sistema sanitario utilizando enfoques ascendentes y descendentes. Se realizó un análisis costo-efectividad calculando el costo incremental por cada resultado negativo que se evitó.
Los costos de atención sanitaria por participante en Sudáfrica fueron de 8340,7 dólares estadounidenses (USD) con el plan largo y de 6618,0 USD con el plan corto; en Etiopía, fueron de 6096,6 y 4552,3 USD, respectivamente. El mayor factor de ahorro fue el costo de los medicamentos en Sudáfrica (67 %; 1157,0 USD del total de 1722,8 USD) y los costos de apoyo social en Etiopía (35 %; 545,2 USD del total de 1544,3 USD). En Etiopía, los participantes del ensayo que siguieron el plan corto notificaron un menor gasto en alimentos suplementarios (reducción media por participante: 225,5 USD) y un aumento en las horas de trabajo (es decir, 667 horas adicionales en 132 semanas). La probabilidad de que el plan corto fuera rentable era superior al 95 % cuando el valor asignado para evitar un resultado negativo era inferior a 19 000 USD en Etiopía y a 14 500 USD en Sudáfrica.
El plan de tratamiento a corto plazo de la tuberculosis MDR se asoció con una reducción sustancial de los costos del sistema sanitario y con una menor carga financiera para los participantes.

Изучение изменений в расходах для систем здравоохранения и участников в результате перехода на краткосрочную схему лечения туберкулеза со множественной лекарственной устойчивостью (МЛУ-ТБ).
Авторы сравнили затраты систем здравоохранения и участников долгосрочных (от 20 до 22 месяцев) и краткосрочных (от 9 до 11 месяцев) схем лечения МЛУ-ТБ в Эфиопии и Южной Африке. Данные о затратах были получены от участников рандомизированного контролируемого клинического исследования фазы III STREAM. Авторы оценивали затраты системы здравоохранения, используя подходы «снизу вверх» и «сверху вниз». Оценка клинико-экономической эффективности выполнялась путем расчета дополнительных затрат на неблагоприятный исход, которого удалось избежать.
Расходы системы здравоохранения на одного участника в Южной Африке составляли 8340,7 долл. США для долгосрочной и 6618,0 долл. США для краткосрочной схемы лечения; в Эфиопии они составляли 6096,6 долл. США и 4552,3 долл. США соответственно. Самым крупным компонентом экономии были расходы на лекарственные препараты в Южной Африке (67%, 1157,0 долл. США от общей суммы 1722,8 долл. США) и расходы на социальную поддержку в Эфиопии (35%, 545,2 долл. США от общей суммы 1544,3 долл. США). В Эфиопии участники исследования по краткосрочной схеме лечения сообщали о более низких расходах на дополнительное питание (среднее сокращение на участника: 225,5 долл. США) и увеличении количества рабочих часов (то есть 667 дополнительных часов на протяжении 132 недель). Вероятность того, что краткосрочная схема лечения была более экономически рентабельной, превышала 95%, в то время как расходы на предотвращение неблагоприятного исхода в Эфиопии составили менее 19 000 долл. США, а в Южной Африке — менее 14 500 долл. США.

35544156,Prevalence and drivers of false-positive rifampicin-resistant Xpert MTB/RIF results: a prospective observational study in Rwanda.,,The Lancet. Microbe,"The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay is used globally to rapidly diagnose tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin. We investigated the frequency and predictors of false-positive findings of rifampicin resistance with Xpert.
We did a prospective, observational study of individuals who were enrolled in a Rwandan nationwide diagnostic cohort study (DIAMA trial; NCT03303963). We included patients identified to have rifampicin resistance on initial Xpert testing. We did a repeat Xpert assay and used rpoB Sanger and deep sequencing alongside phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) to ascertain final rifampicin susceptibility status, with any (hetero)resistant result overriding. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess predictors of false rifampicin resistance on initial Xpert testing, adjusted for HIV status, tuberculosis treatment history, initial Xpert semi-quantitative bacillary load, and initial Xpert probe.
Between May 4, 2017, and April 30, 2019, 175 people were identified with rifampicin resistance at initial Xpert testing, of whom 154 (88%) underwent repeat Xpert assay. 54 (35%) patients were confirmed as rifampicin resistant on repeat testing and 100 (65%) were not confirmed with resistance. After further testing and sequencing, 121 (79%) of 154 patients had a final confirmed status for rifampicin susceptibility. 57 (47%) of 121 patients were confirmed to have a false rifampicin resistance result and 64 (53%) had true rifampicin resistance. A high pretest probability of rifampicin resistance did not decrease the odds of false rifampicin resistance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6·0, 95% CI 1·0-35·0, for new tuberculosis patients vs patients who needed retreatment). Ten (16%) of the 64 patients with true rifampicin resistance did not have confirmed rifampicin resistance on repeat Xpert testing, of whom four had heteroresistance. Of 63 patients with a very low bacillary load on Xpert testing, 54 (86%) were falsely diagnosed with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Having a very low bacillary load on Xpert testing was strongly associated with false rifampicin resistance at the initial Xpert assay (aOR 63·6, 95% CI 9·9-410·4).
The Xpert testing algorithm should include an assessment of bacillary load and retesting in case rifampicin resistance is detected on a paucibacillary sputum sample. Only when rifampicin resistance has been confirmed on repeat testing should multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment be started. When rifampicin resistance has not been confirmed on repeat testing, we propose that patients should be given first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs and monitored closely during treatment, including by baseline culture, pDST, and further Xpert testing.

32470182,The pharmacokinetics of para-aminosalicylic acid and its relationship to efficacy and intolerance.,"efficacy, intolerance, para-aminosalicylic acid, pharmacokinetics",British journal of clinical pharmacology,"Following its introduction as an antituberculosis agent close to 75 years ago, the use of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) has been limited by gastrointestinal intolerance and multiple formulations were produced in attempts to reduce its occurrence. More recently, an enteric-coated, granular, slow-release PAS formulation (PASER) was introduced and is now in wide-spread use for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The current PASER dosing regimen is based on recommendations derived from older studies using a variety of different PAS formulations and relegate PAS to a role as an exclusively bacteriostatic agent. However, there is ample evidence that if sufficiently high serum concentrations are reached, PAS can be bactericidal and that intolerance following once daily dosing, that aids the achievement of such concentrations, is no worse than that following intermittent daily dosing. In particular, prevention of resistance to companion drugs appears to be dependent on the size of the single dose, and hence the peak concentrations, and not on maintaining serum levels consistently above minimum inhibitory concentration. We present a narrative review of the development of PAS formulations, dosing practices, and published data regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and the relationship of PAS dosage to intolerance and efficacy. Our conclusions suggests that we are at present not using PAS to its maximum ability to contribute to regimen efficacy and protect companion drugs.",,,,2020-05-30,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these new drugs bedaquiline (Bdq) and delamanid (Dlm).
A total of 318 patients with MDR-TB were reviewed by the committee from September 2016 to February 2018; 282 (88.7%) of them were treated with the new drugs (Bdq, 107 patients; Dlm, 108 patients; and both concurrently or sequentially, 67 patients) and retrospectively evaluated. Culture conversion rates, interim treatment outcomes at 12 months, and predictors of unfavorable outcomes were analyzed. Treatment efficacy was also compared between Bdq and Dlm.
The mean age of the patients was 49.3 years, and 197 (69.9%) were male. Three patients were HIV seropositive and 151 (53.5%) were quinolone resistant. The culture conversion rates at 2 and 6 months were 57.4% (81/141) and 89.4% (126/141), respectively. A favorable outcome at 12 months was achieved in 84.8% of patients (239/282).

32411461,N-Acetyl Cysteine as an Adjunct in the Treatment of Tuberculosis.,,Tuberculosis research and treatment,"Oxidative stress is a common feature of tuberculosis (TB), and persons with reduced antioxidants are at more risk of TB. TB patients with relatively severe oxidative stress had also more advanced disease as measured by the Karnofsky performance index. Since adverse effects from anti-TB drugs are also mediated by free radicals, TB patients are prone to side effects, such as hearing loss. In previous articles, researchers appealed for clinical trials aiming at evaluating N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in attenuating the dreaded hearing loss during multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) treatment. However, before embarking on such trials, considerations of NAC's overall impact on TB treatment are crucial. Unfortunately, such a comprehensive report on NAC is missing in the literature and this manuscript reviews the broader effect of NAC on TB treatment. This paper discusses NAC's effect on mycobacterial clearance, hearing loss, drug-induced liver injury, and its interaction with anti-TB drugs. Based on the evidence accrued to date, NAC appears to have various beneficial effects on TB treatment. However, despite the favorable interaction between NAC and first-line anti-TB drugs, the interaction between the antioxidant and some of the second-line anti-TB drugs needs further investigations.",,,,2020-05-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In this study, we analyse the effectiveness and patient cost-difference of VOT compared to clinic-based directly observed therapy (DOT) in improving medication adherence in Moldova, a LMIC in Eastern Europe.
The study was a two-arm individually randomised trial with 197 TB patients (n=99 DOT control group; n=98 VOT treatment group; multidrug-resistant TB cases were excluded). The primary outcome was observed medication adherence, measured by the number of days that a patient failed to be observed adhering to medication for every 2-week period during the course of their treatment.
VOT significantly decreased nonadherence by 4 days (95% CI 3.35-4.67 days, p<0.01) per 2-week period: 5.24 days missed per 2-week period for DOT and 1.29 days for VOT.

The long duration of treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) is associated with nonadherence and loss to follow up, and the treatment success rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is low (approximately 50%) with longer regimens. In this review article, we report recent advances and ongoing clinical trials aimed at shortening regimens for DS-TB and MDR-TB. We discuss the role of high-dose rifampin, as well as that of clofazimine and linezolid in regimens for DS-TB. There are at least 5 ongoing clinical trials and 17 observational studies and clinical trials evaluating shorter regimens for DS-TB and MDR-TB, respectively. We also report the results of observational studies and clinical trials evaluating a standardized nine-month moxifloxacin-based regimen for MDR-TB. Further studies, especially randomized clinical trials, are needed to evaluate regimens including newer drugs, drugs proven to be or highly likely to be efficacious, and all-oral drugs in an effort to eliminate the need for injectable drugs.

However, globally, TB is still one of the leading causes of death by infectious diseases. In 2018, approximately 10.0 million people were diagnosed with TB owing to the development of advanced strategies by M. tuberculosis to resist antibiotics, including the development of a dormant state. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are dedicated to ending TB by 2030. However, the development of strategies to discover new TB drugs and new therapies is crucial for the achievement of this goal. Unfortunately, the rapid occurrence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis has worsened the current situation, thereby warranting prioritized discovery of new anti-TB drugs and the development of new treatment regimens in academia and the pharmaceutical industry.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the drug combination for 26 weeks in patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that was not responsive to treatment or for which a second-line regimen had been discontinued because of side effects. The primary end point was the incidence of an unfavorable outcome, defined as treatment failure (bacteriologic or clinical) or relapse during follow-up, which continued until 6 months after the end of treatment. Patients were classified as having a favorable outcome at 6 months if they had resolution of clinical disease, a negative culture status, and had not already been classified as having had an unfavorable outcome. Other efficacy end points and safety were also evaluated.
A total of 109 patients were enrolled in the study and were included in the evaluation of efficacy and safety end points. At 6 months after the end of treatment in the intention-to-treat analysis, 11 patients (10%) had an unfavorable outcome and 98 patients (90%; 95% confidence interval, 83 to 95) had a favorable outcome. The 11 unfavorable outcomes were 7 deaths (6 during treatment and 1 from an unknown cause during follow-up), 1 withdrawal of consent during treatment, 2 relapses during follow-up, and 1 loss to follow-up. The expected linezolid toxic effects of peripheral neuropathy (occurring in 81% of patients) and myelosuppression (48%), although common, were manageable, often leading to dose reductions or interruptions in treatment with linezolid.

Long-term use of antimicrobial treatments has led to the development of severe bacterial resistance, which has become increasingly serious due to antibiotic abuse, resulting in the treatment of bacterial infections becoming challenging. The repurposing of approved drugs presents a promising strategy to address current bottlenecks in the development of novel antibacterial agents. Drug repurposing is a cost-effective emerging strategy, which aims to treat resistant infectious diseases by identifying known drugs with predicted efficacy for diseases other than the target disease. This strategy has potential in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), particularly drug-resistant TB. In recent years, a panel of drugs approved for clinical use or clinical trials, such as linezolid, vancomycin and celecoxib, have been found to have anti-TB activities. However, the utility of drug repurposing is limited by the number of candidate compounds and their low activities. The low activities of repurposed drugs have slowed the development of a drug-repurposing strategy for anti-TB drugs. The present review discusses progress in the discovery of new anti-TB agents through drug repurposing since 2014. We also discuss the challenges faced and analyze the innovative ways that are being used to overcome these difficulties. This review may provide a useful guide for researchers in the field of drug repurposing.",,,,2020-03-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Clofazimine (CLO) and pyrazinamide (PZA) are important components of recommended standard multidrug treatments of TB. Paradoxically, in a phase IIa trial aiming to define the early bactericidal activity (EBA) of CLO and PZA monotherapy over the first 14 days of treatment, no significant drug effect was demonstrated for the two drugs using traditional statistical analysis. Using a model-based analysis, we characterized the statistically significant exposure-response relationships for both drugs that could explain the original findings of an increase in the numbers of CFU with CLO treatment and no effect with PZA. Sensitive analyses are crucial for exploring drug effects in early clinical trials to make the right decisions for advancement to further development. We propose that this quantitative semimechanistic approach provides a rational framework for analyzing phase IIa EBA studies and can accelerate anti-TB drug development.",,,,2020-03-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Ongoing clinical trials will hopefully transform the landscape for treatment of drug sensitive TB, drug resistant TB, and latent TB infection. Multiple trials are evaluating novel agents, repurposed agents, adjunctive host directed therapies, and novel treatment strategies that will increase the probability of success of future clinical trials. Guidelines for HIV-TB co-infection treatment continue to be updated and drug resistance testing has been revolutionized in recent years with the shift from phenotypic to genotypic testing and the concomitant increased speed of results. These coming changes are long overdue and are sorely needed to address the vast disparities in global TB incidence rates.

A retrospective longitudinal analysis on four surveys of anti-TB drug resistance done in 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013 in Zhejiang province, China. 4289 sputum-smear microscopy positive suspected tuberculosis patients were eligible at 30 investigation points, chosen by stratified random sampling at survey sites from all over the province. Culturing samples in L-J medium and the drug-susceptibility testing for the 4 first-line anti-TB drugs were performed to all patients. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to determine the factors associated with the rifampicin-resistance in the study population.
Overall, there were 3832 patients with positive mycobacterial cultures, and 2813 of the isolates (73.4%) were susceptible to all 4 first-line drugs. Analysis of rifampin monoresistant (RMR) TB indicated the prevalence was 1.1% in new cases and 3.4% in previously treated cases. Among the 359 rifampicin resistant TB (RR-TB) cases, 279 (77.7%) were also resistant to isoniazid, indicating MDR-TB. From 1998 to 2013, the proportion of MDR-TB among rifampicin-resistant TB cases varied between 80.0% and 87.5% (P for trend: 0.768) among previously treated cases and varied from 68.6% to 79.5% (P for trend: 0.403) among new cases. Among previously treated patients, those who received treatment for less than 6 months were less likely to have drug resistant TB (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.16-0.97) or MDR-TB (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07-0.81).

32053584,"Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020.",,MMWR. Recommendations and reports : Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Recommendations and reports,"Comprehensive guidelines for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among persons living in the United States were last published in 2000 (American Thoracic Society. CDC targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000;161:S221-47). Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update previous guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review and make new recommendations for the most effective and least toxic regimens for treatment of LTBI among persons who live in the United States.The systematic literature review included clinical trials of regimens to treat LTBI. Quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) from clinical trial comparisons was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. In addition, a network meta-analysis evaluated regimens that had not been compared directly in clinical trials. The effectiveness outcome was tuberculosis disease; the toxicity outcome was hepatotoxicity. Strong GRADE recommendations required at least moderate evidence of effectiveness and that the desirable consequences outweighed the undesirable consequences in the majority of patients. Conditional GRADE recommendations were made when determination of whether desirable consequences outweighed undesirable consequences was uncertain (e.g., with low-quality evidence).These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines include the NTCA- and CDC-recommended treatment regimens that comprise three preferred rifamycin-based regimens and two alternative monotherapy regimens with daily isoniazid. All recommended treatment regimens are intended for persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin. These updated guidelines do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; recommendations for treating contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were published in 2019 (Nahid P, Mase SR Migliori GB, et al. Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA clinical practice guideline. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2019;200:e93-e142). The three rifamycin-based preferred regimens are 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, 4 months of daily rifampin, or 3 months of daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Prescribing providers or pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable, and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correct medication for the intended regimen. Preference for these rifamycin-based regimens was made on the basis of effectiveness, safety, and high treatment completion rates. The two alternative treatment regimens are daily isoniazid for 6 or 9 months; isoniazid monotherapy is efficacious but has higher toxicity risk and lower treatment completion rates than shorter rifamycin-based regimens.In summary, short-course (3- to 4-month) rifamycin-based treatment regimens are preferred over longer-course (6-9 month) isoniazid monotherapy for treatment of LTBI. These updated guidelines can be used by clinicians, public health officials, policymakers, health care organizations, and other state and local stakeholders who might need to adapt them to fit individual clinical circumstances.",,,,2020-02-14,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Regimens including the oral agent bedaquiline have been shown to be efficacious and safe, leading to its incorporation into multiple national TB treatment programs. This analysis evaluated the impact of increased adoption of bedaquiline-containing regimens on the DR-TB burden in China.
A state-transition model was developed that permits movement and interaction between susceptible, latent, and active TB disease states, while distinguishing between drug-sensitive (DS) and DR-TB. Model inputs were obtained from the published literature or derived such that model metrics approximated those published by the WHO. Expected improvements in infrastructure were built into the model to forecast the epidemiology of DR-TB in China through 2040 in the absence of bedaquiline (baseline forecast). The impact of higher utilization of bedaquiline-containing regimens (85% peak share) was then assessed in two scenarios that differed with regard to treatment success rates of the regimens: 61% (reflecting findings of clinical trials) and 80% (reflecting data from observational studies), versus the 44% success rate associated with standard-of-care treatment.
In the baseline scenario, the model predicted increases in annual incidence of DR-TB by 6-8% during each five-year period between 2020 and 2040, with an increase of 30% over the entire study duration. Adoption of bedaquiline-based regimens limits the incidence increases to only 1-3% in each five-year period and to 8% over the study duration in the 61% success rate scenario. Incidence declines by 1-6% during each five-year period and by 12% over the study duration in the 80% success rate scenario. Similar effects on DR-TB prevalence (4-5% increase in baseline, 0-7% decline in scenario 1, and 4-19% decline in scenario 2) and mortality (5-7% increase in baseline, 0-16% decline in scenario 1, and 6-40% decline in scenario 2) were seen following bedaquiline adoption.

Mechanism of anti-TB action of perchlozone might be similar to that of thiacetazone, which belongs into the same chemical class. Perchlozone has to be probably activated into reactive species by a mycobacterially encoded monoxygenase (EthA). The activated forms might act in multiple ways, including inhibition of mycobacterial cell wall synthesis due to interfence with a dehydration step of the type II fatty acid synthase pathway or sensitization of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell to oxidative stress. Favorable toxicological properties of perchlozone and its tolerability by the human organism were confirmed within revevant preclinical and clinical studies. However, recent preliminary investigations in vivo (animal models) could indicate genotoxicity after subacute inhalation of the drug.

If patients miss too many doses (non-adherence), they may transmit infection for longer and the infecting bacteria may develop resistance to the standard drugs used for treatment. Non-adherence may therefore risk both their health and that of others. Within England, certain population groups are thought to be at higher risk of non-adherence, but the factors contributing to this have been insufficiently determined, as have the best interventions to promote adherence. The objective of this study was to develop a manualised package of interventions for use as part of routine care within National Health Services to address the social and cultural factors that lead to poor adherence to treatment for TB disease.
This study uses a mixed-methods approach, with six study components. These are (1) scoping reviews of the literature; (2) qualitative research with patients, carers and healthcare professionals; (3) development of the intervention; (4) a pilot randomised controlled trial of the manualised intervention; (5) a process evaluation to examine clinical utility; and (6) a cost analysis.
This study received ethics approval on 24 December 2018 from Camberwell St. Giles Ethics Committee, UK (REC reference 18/LO/1818). Findings will be published and disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, published in an end of study report to our funder (the National Institute for Health Research, UK) and presented to key stakeholders.

31833904,Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,,Chinese medical journal,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most debilitating diseases worldwide. Current studies have shown that vitamin D plays a significant role in host immune defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but clinical trials reported inconsistent results. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation could improve the effect of anti-TB therapy.
We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from their inception to February 8th, 2019 for randomized controlled trials on vitamin D supplementation in patients with pulmonary TB receiving anti-TB therapy. The primary outcomes were time to sputum culture and smear conversion and proportion of participants with negative sputum culture. The secondary outcomes were clinical response to treatment and adverse events. A random-effects model was used to pool studies. Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software.
Five studies with a total of 1126 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation did not shorten the time to sputum culture and smear conversion (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.23, P = 0.60; HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93-1.41, P = 0.20, respectively) and did not lead to an increase in the proportion of participants with negative sputum culture (relative risk [RR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.97-1.11, P = 0.32). However, it reduced the time to sputum culture conversion in the sub-group of participants with TaqI tt genotype (HR 8.09, 95% CI 1.39-47.09, P = 0.02) and improved the multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB sputum culture conversion rate (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.11-5.18, P = 0.03). There was no influence on secondary outcomes.

Currently, antitubercular drugs are unable to eradicate subpopulations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli and therapeutic vaccinations have been postulated to overcome some of the critical issues related to the increase of drug-resistant forms and the difficult clinical and public health management of tuberculosis patients. The Horizon 2020 EC funded project ""In Silico Trial for Tuberculosis Vaccine Development"" (STriTuVaD) to support the identification of new therapeutic interventions against tuberculosis through novel in silico modelling of human immune responses to disease and vaccines, thereby drastically reduce the cost of clinical trials in this critical sector of public healthcare.
We present the application of the Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) computational modeling infrastructure as a disease model for TB. The model is capable to simulate the main features and dynamics of the immune system activities i.e., the artificial immunity induced by RUTI® vaccine, a polyantigenic liposomal therapeutic vaccine made of fragments of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells (FCMtb). Based on the available data coming from phase II Clinical Trial in subjects with latent tuberculosis infection treated with RUTI® and isoniazid, we generated simulation scenarios through validated data in order to tune UISS accordingly to STriTuVaD objectives. The first case simulates the establishment of MTB latent chronic infection with some typical granuloma formation; the second scenario deals with a reactivation phase during latent chronic infection; the third represents the latent chronic disease infection scenario during RUTI® vaccine administration.
The application of this computational modeling strategy helpfully contributes to simulate those mechanisms involved in the early stages and in the progression of tuberculosis infection and to predict how specific therapeutical strategies will act in this scenario. In view of these results, UISS owns the capacity to open the door for a prompt integration of in silico methods within the pipeline of clinical trials, supporting and guiding the testing of treatments in patients affected by tuberculosis.",,"We present the application of the Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) computational modeling infrastructure as a disease model for TB.

This study aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of new re-treatment regimens, and explore risk factors associated with recurrence after successful treatment. We conducted a cohort study in nine regions of China and enrolled previously treated TB patients from October, 2008 to December, 2010. Patients were randomly divided into four treatment regimen groups including standard, high-dose, long-course, and individualized treatment. After treatment, those with successful treatment outcomes were followed up to 7 years. The effects of different regimens and the information of recurrence were recorded. Risk factors to poor treatment outcomes were calculated using logistic regression model, while risk factors to recurrence or death were calculated using Cox model. Four hundred ninety-two participants were enrolled during the study time and 419 patients were included in our analysis of treatment effects. Overall, the treatment success rate is 75.9%, and the recurrence and death rate is 6.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Reduced risks of poor outcomes were observed in patients who were treated with high-dose and individualized regimen compared with standard regimen, and the adjusted ORs were 0.3 (0.1-0.6), 0.2 (0.1-0.5), respectively. In our analysis of factors associated with recurrence, all documented variables were not significant. Revised re-treatment regimen has better therapeutic effects compared to standard regimen, but it was not associated with lower risk of TB recurrence. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the role of other revised re-treatment regimens in recurrence risk.

Preventative antibiotic treatment for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections in high-prevalence settings is unfeasible due to unclear treatment durability, drug toxicity, logistical constraints related to directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) and the lengthy treatment protocols. Together, these factors promote non-adherence, contributing to relapse and establishment of drug-resistant Mtb strains. Although antibiotic treatment of drug-susceptible Mtb is generally effective, drug-resistant TB has a treatment efficacy below 50% and can, in a proportion, develop into progressive, untreatable disease. Other immune compromising co-infections and/or co-morbidities require more complex prevention/treatment approaches, posing huge financial burdens to national health services. Novel TB treatment strategies, such as host-directed therapeutics, are required to complement pathogen-targeted approaches. Pre-clinical studies have highlighted promising candidates that enhance endogenous pathways and/or limit destructive host responses. This review discusses promising pre-clinical candidates and forerunning compounds at advanced stages of clinical investigation in TB host-directed therapeutic (HDT) efficacy trials.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately one-quarter of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In Ger- many, the incidence of tuberculosis was in decline over several decades but rose in 2015 to 7.3 new cases per 100 000 persons. In 2018, a total of 5429 new cases were documented, corresponding to 6.5 new cases per 100 000 persons.
This article is based on literature retrieved by a selective search in PubMed and on the authors' clinical experience.
Tuberculosis involves the lungs in almost 75% of patients but can generally involve any organ. In Germany, the majority of patients come from high-incidence countries. If a patient's differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, the main tests for the detection of the pathogen in sputum and tissue samples are culture (the gold standard), microscopy, and nucleic acid amplification tests. Imaging studies are also used for diagnosis and follow-up. The standard treatment consists of a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, followed by a combination of isoniazid and rifampicin only. Liver damage is one of the more common adverse effects of this treatment, arising in 2.4% of patients. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which is rare in Germany (around 100 cases per year), should be treated in special- ized centers.
Rapid diagnosis and targeted treatment are essential to prevent an unfavorable course of the disease as well as its transmission to other individuals. In patients presenting with unclear symptoms, tuberculosis should always be considered as a differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of latent tuberculosis and decision-making regarding its treatment are difficult because of the lack of specific biomarkers and of relevant data from clinical trials.",,"Tuberculosis involves the lungs in almost 75% of patients but can generally involve any organ.

We evaluate a novel system in which patient-nominated lay carers were trained to deliver intramuscular injections to patients in their own homes.
A pragmatic, individually randomised non-inferiority trial was conducted at two hospitals in Malawi. Adults starting TB retreatment were recruited. Patients randomised to the intervention received home-based care from patient-nominated lay people trained to deliver intramuscular streptomycin. Patients receiving standard care were admitted to hospital for 2 months of streptomycin. The primary outcome was successful treatment (alive and on treatment) at the end of the intervention.
Of 456 patients screened, 204 participants were randomised. The trial was terminated early due to futility. At the end of the intervention, 97/101 (96.0%) in the hospital arm were still alive and on treatment compared with 96/103 (93.2%) in the home-based arm (risk difference -0.03 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.03); p value 0.538).

Thus, efforts to improve existing TB drugs should also be prioritized. Improved efficacy and decreased dose and associated toxicity of existing drugs would translate to greater compliance, life expectancy and quality of life of Mtb infected individuals. One potential strategy to improve existing drugs is to deliver them by inhalation as aerosols to the lung, the primary site of Mtb infection.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ensartinib in ALK-positive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in whom crizotinib therapy was unsuccessful. The associations between ensartinib efficacy and crizotinib-resistant mutations were also explored.
We did a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study at 27 centres in China. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had stage IIIb or stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed while they were on crizotinib therapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, had measurable disease, and had received fewer than three previous treatments. Patients with CNS metastases were included if these metastases were asymptomatic and did not require steroid therapy. All patients received 225 mg ensartinib orally once daily on a continuous dosing schedule. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1), as assessed by an independent review committee in all patients who received at least one dose of ensartinib with no major violations of the inclusion criteria (ie, the full analysis set). Safety was assessed in all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of ensartinib. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03215693.
Between Sept 28, 2017, and April 11, 2018, 160 patients were enrolled and had at least one dose of ensartinib (safety analysis set). Four patients had inclusion violations and were excluded from the efficacy analysis, which thus included 156 patients (full analysis set). 97 (62%) patients in the full analysis set had brain metastases. 76 (52% [95% CI 43-60]) of 147 patients in the full analysis set, with responses that could be assessed by the independent review committee, had an objective response. 28 (70% [53-83]) of 40 patients with measurable brain metastases as assessed by the independent review committee had an intracranial objective response. 145 (91%) of 160 patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event, which were mostly grade 1 or 2. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash (89 [56%]), increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations (74 [46%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (65 [41%]).
Ensartinib has activity and is well tolerated in patients with crizotinib-refractory, ALK-positive NSCLC, including those with brain metastases. The role of ensartinib in patients in whom other second-generation ALK inhibitors have been unsuccessful warrants further studies.

In a set of studies designed to validate this approach, we show moxifloxacin to be the most effective fluoroquinolone, and PDi modeling-based Monte Carlo simulations accurately predict negative culture conversion (sputum sterilization) rates compared to eight independent clinical trials. In addition, PDi-based simulations were used to predict the risk of relapse. Our analyses show that the duration of treatment following culture conversion can be used to predict the relapse rate.

We carried out a prospective, randomized, multicenter study in China that was focused on the potential of a shorter regimen containing clofazimine (CFZ) for the treatment of MDR-TB. There were 135 MDR-TB cases that met eligibility requirements and were randomly stratified into either the control group or experimental group. Patients in the control group received an 18-month treatment regimen, whereas patients in the experimental group received a 12-month treatment regimen containing CFZ.
At the completion of the treatment period, the difference in sputum-culture conversion rates between the experimental group and the control group was not significant. Notably, by the end of 3 months of treatment, 68.7% patients receiving the experimental regimen had sputum-culture conversion, as compared with 55.9% of those receiving the control regimen; this was a significant difference, suggesting an early sputum conversion (P = .04). There were 67 adverse events reported in 56 patients in this study, including 32 in the control group and 35 in the experimental group. No significant difference in the overall incidences of adverse events was observed between the 2 groups.
The MDR-TB patients treated with the shorter regimen containing CFZ had a comparable successful outcome rate when compared to those with the standard regimen. The patients assigned to the experimental group achieved more rapid sputum-culture conversion, reflecting superior antimicrobial activity against MDR-TB.

31526739,Management of drug-resistant tuberculosis.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major public health concern in many countries. Over the past decade, the number of patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the most effective drugs against tuberculosis (ie, rifampicin and isoniazid), which is called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, has continued to increase. Globally, 4·6% of patients with tuberculosis have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but in some areas, like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine, this proportion exceeds 25%. Treatment for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is prolonged (ie, 9-24 months) and patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have less favourable outcomes than those treated for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Individualised multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment with novel (eg, bedaquiline) and repurposed (eg, linezolid, clofazimine, or meropenem) drugs and guided by genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can improve treatment outcomes. Some clinical trials are evaluating 6-month regimens to simplify management and improve outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

Decisions about whether and how to implement such regimens will require an understanding of their likely clinical impact and how this impact depends on local epidemiology and implementation strategy.
A Markov state-transition model of 100,000 representative South African adults with TB was used to simulate implementation of the regimen BPaMZ (bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide), either for RR-TB only or universally for all patients. Patient outcomes, including cure rates, time with active TB, and time on treatment, were compared to outcomes under current care. Sensitivity analyses varied the drug-resistance epidemiology, rifampin susceptibility testing practices, and regimen efficacy.
Using BPaMZ exclusively for RR-TB increased the proportion of all RR-TB that was cured by initial treatment from 60 ± 1% to 67 ± 1%. Expanding use of BPaMZ to all patients increased cure of RR-TB to 89 ± 1% and cure of all TB from 87.3 ± 0.1% to 89.5 ± 0.1%, while shortening treatment by 1.9 months/person. In sensitivity analyses, reducing the coverage of rifampin susceptibility testing resulted in lower projected proportions of patients cured under all regimen scenarios (current care, RR-only BPaMZ, and universal BPaMZ), compared to the proportions projected using South Africa's high coverage; however, this reduced coverage resulted in greater expected incremental benefits of universal BPaMZ implementation, both when compared to RR-only BPaMZ implementation and when compared to to current care under the same low rifampin susceptibility testing coverage. In settings with higher RR-TB prevalence, the benefits of BPaMZ were magnified both for RR-specific and universal BPaMZ implementation.
Novel regimens such as BPaMZ could improve RR-TB outcomes and shorten treatment for all patients, particularly with universal use. Decision-makers weighing early options for implementing such regimens at scale will want to consider the expected impact on patient outcomes and on the burden of treatment in their local context.",,"Using BPaMZ exclusively for RR-TB increased the proportion of all RR-TB that was cured by initial treatment from 60 ± 1% to 67 ± 1%.

Despite improvements in addressing this epidemic in Georgia, tuberculosis remains a significant public health concern due to sub-optimal patient management. Low remuneration for specialists, limited private-sector interest in provision of infectious disease care and incomplete integration in primary care are at the core of this problem.
This protocol sets out the methods of a two-arm cluster randomized control trial which aims to generate evidence on the effectiveness of a performance-based financing and integrated care intervention on tuberculosis loss to follow-up and treatment adherence. The trial will be implemented in health facilities (clusters) under-performing in tuberculosis management. Eligible and consenting facilities will be randomly assigned to either intervention or control (standard care). Health providers within intervention sites will form a case management team and be trained in the delivery of integrated tuberculosis care; performance-related payments based on monthly records of patients adhering to treatment and quality of care assessments will be disbursed to health providers in these facilities. The primary outcomes include loss to follow-up among adult pulmonary drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis patients. Secondary outcomes are adherence to treatment among drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis patients and treatment success among drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment regimen will also be collected. The required sample size to detect a 6% reduction in loss to follow-up among drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients and a 20% reduction in loss to follow-up among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients is 948 and 136 patients, respectively.
The trial contributes to a limited body of rigorous evidence and literature on the effectiveness of supply-side performance-based financing interventions on tuberculosis patient outcomes. Realist and health economic evaluations will be conducted in parallel with the trial, and associated composite findings will serve as a resource for the Georgian and wider regional Ministries of Health in relation to future tuberculosis and wider health policies. The trial and complementing evaluations are part of Results4TB, a multidisciplinary collaboration engaging researchers and Georgian policy and practice stakeholders in the design and evaluation of a context-sensitive tuberculosis management intervention.

Early treatment of TB is critical; in the absence of rapid- susceptibility testing, the empiric selection of drugs should be guided by clinical data. This study aimed to determine the clinical predictors of DR-TB. From September 2010 to August 2017, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected from 144 patients with tuberculosis at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. Isolates were subjected to drug-susceptibility testing. Clinical predictors of DR-TB were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. Any drug, isoniazid, and rifampin resistance rates were 47.7, 23.0, and 11.6%, respectively. The visualization of cavities and nodules through either chest radiography or computed tomography were independent predictors of DR-TB. In conclusion, early detection of DR-TB in this population could be based on multiple cavities being observed using chest imaging.

Innovative technology is the need of the hour to identify these cases that remain either undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed due to the unavailability of appropriate tools at primary healthcare settings. We developed and evaluated 3 kits, namely 'TB Detect' (containing BioFM-Filter device), 'TB Concentration and Transport' (containing Trans-Filter device) and 'TB DNA Extraction' kits. These kits enable bio-safe equipment-free concentration of sputum on filters and improved fluorescence microscopy at primary healthcare centres, ambient temperature transport of dried inactivated sputum filters to central laboratories and molecular detection of drug resistance by PCR and DNA sequencing (Mol-DST). In a 2-site evaluation (n = 1190 sputum specimens) on presumptive TB patients, BioFM-Filter smear exhibited a significant increase in positivity of 7% and 4% over ZN smear and LED-FM smear (p<0.05), respectively and an increment in smear grade status (1+ or 2+ to 3+) of 16% over ZN smear and 20% over LED-FM smear. The sensitivity of Mol-DST in presumptive MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases (n = 148) was 90% for Rifampicin (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-96%), 84% for Isoniazid (95% CI, 72-92%), 83% for Fluoroquinolones (95% CI, 66-93%) and 75% for Aminoglycosides (95% CI, 35-97%), using phenotypic DST as the reference standard. Test specificity was 88-93% and concordance was ~89-92% (κ value 0.8-0.9). The patient-friendly kits described here address several of the existing challenges and are designed to provide 'Universal Access' to rapid TB diagnosis, including drug-resistant disease.

The final analysis data set contained 17,725 observations from 1,054 subjects, including healthy subjects and subjects with drug-sensitive, multidrug-resistant, or extensively drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis dosed pretomanid in monotherapy or combination therapy for up to 6 months. Pretomanid pharmacokinetic behavior was described by a one-compartment model that at a given dose was linear in its absorption and clearance processes but where the rate of absorption and extent of bioavailability changed with dose. Clearance and volume of distribution scaled allometrically with weight. Apparent clearance in females was 18% less than in males. Among HIV-positive subjects, absent the effect of CYP3A4-inducing antiretrovirals, apparent clearance was 6% higher. Some effects of total bilirubin and albumin were found, but the impacts on exposure were small. Bioavailability in the fasted condition was about half that in the fed condition. Relative bioavailability decreased with increasing dose in the fasted condition, but not for doses of ≤200 mg in the fed condition. HIV-positive subjects taking efavirenz and lopinavir/ritonavir had exposures that were reduced by 46 and 17%, respectively. There was little evidence for noteworthy effects of regimen partners on pretomanid.

Three heart rate corrections to QT were considered: Fridericia's QTcF, Bazett's QTcB, and a population-specific correction, QTcN. QTc increased with the plasma concentrations of pretomanid, bedaquiline's M2 metabolite, and moxifloxacin in a manner described by a linear model in which the three slope coefficients were constant across studies, visits within study, and times postdose within visit but where the intercept varied across those dimensions. The intercepts tended to increase on treatment to a plateau after several weeks, a pattern termed the secular trend. The slope terms were similar for the three QTc corrections, but the secular trends differed, suggesting that at least some of the secular trend was due to the elevated heart rates of tuberculosis patients decreasing to normal levels on treatment.

Antimicrobial activity of rifampicin was initially proved in vitro; subsequently numerous in vivo studies showed the bactericidal properties and dose-dependent effect of rifampicin. Rifampicin was first during the late 1960s to treat patients suffering from chronic drug-resistant pulmonary TB. Decades later, rifampicin continues to be studied with particular emphasis on whether higher doses could shorten the duration of treatment without increasing relapse or having adverse effects. Lesion-specific drug penetration and pharmacokinetics of rifampicin are improving our understanding of effective concentration while potentially refining drug regimen designs. Another prospective aspect of high-dose rifampicin is its potential use in treating discrepant mutation thereby eliminating the need for MDR treatment. To date, several clinical trials have shown the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of high-dose rifampicin. Currently, high-dose rifampicin has been used successfully in a routine clinical setting for the treatment of high-risk patients.

To determine diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra for tuberculosis in adults with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and for rifampicin resistance in adults with presumptive rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, to 11 October 2018, without language restriction.
Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies using respiratory specimens that evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, or both against the reference standard, culture for tuberculosis and culture-based drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus for rifampicin resistance.
Four review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. When possible, we also extracted data by smear and HIV status. We assessed study quality using QUADAS-2 and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity separately for tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. Most analyses used a bivariate random-effects model. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated accuracy using all included studies and then only the subset of studies where participants were unselected, i.e. not selected based on prior microscopy testing.
We identified in total 95 studies (77 new studies since the previous review): 86 studies (42,091 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis and 57 studies (8287 participants) for rifampicin resistance.

Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 88% (83% to 92%) in HIV-negative and 81% (75% to 86%) in HIV-positive participants; specificities were similar 98% (97% to 99%), (14 studies).Rifampicin resistance detectionXpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% Crl) were 96% (94% to 97%) and 98% (98% to 99%), (48 studies, 8020 participants; high-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, 114 would be positive for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and 18 (16%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false-positives); 886 would be would be negative for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and four (0.4%) would have rifampicin resistance (false-negatives).Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) was 95% (90% to 98%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 95% (91% to 98%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 98% (97% to 99%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 98% (96% to 99%), (1 study, 551 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
We found Xpert MTB/RIF to be sensitive and specific for diagnosing PTB and rifampicin resistance, consistent with findings reported previously. Xpert MTB/RIF was more sensitive for tuberculosis in smear-positive than smear-negative participants and HIV-negative than HIV-positive participants.

Mycobacterial burden assessed by smear microscopy grade and time to culture positivity is clearly interpretable by most physicians. GeneXpert (Xpert) has been recommended by WHO as a first line tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic test as an alternative to smear microscopy. Xpert gives cycle threshold (Ct) values as a potential measure for mycobacterial burden. For physicians to clearly interpret Ct values as measures of mycobacterial burden, this study compared the Xpert quantification capabilities with those of smear microscopy and culture. The study also determined a linear relationship between Xpert Ct values and MGIT culture time to positivity (MGIT-TTP) and associated factors. A cut off Ct value which best predicts smear positivity was also determined using the Receiver Operator Curve analysis method.
Excluding missing results and rifampicin resistant TB cases, a moderately strong correlation of 0.55 between Xpert Ct value and smear grade was obtained. A weak correlation of 0.37 was obtained between Xpert Ct values and MGIT time to positivity while that between Xpert Ct values and LJ culture was 0.34. The Xpert Ct values were found to increase by 2.57 for every unit increase in days to positive and HIV status was significantly associated with this relationship. A cut off Ct value of 23.62 was found to best predict smear positivity regardless of HIV status.
Our study findings show that GeneXpert Ct values are comparable to smear microscopy as a measure of M. tuberculosis burden and can be used to replace smear microscopy. However, given the low correlation between Xpert Ct value and culture positivity, Xpert Ct values cannot replace culture as a measure of M. tuberculosis burden among TB patients.",,"Excluding missing results and rifampicin resistant TB cases, a moderately strong correlation of 0.55 between Xpert Ct value and smear grade was obtained.

31075149,Artificial intelligence enabled parabolic response surface platform identifies ultra-rapid near-universal TB drug treatment regimens comprising approved drugs.,,PloS one,"Shorter, more effective treatments for tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. While many TB drugs are available, identification of the best regimens is challenging because of the large number of possible drug-dose combinations. We have found consistently that responses of cells or whole animals to drug-dose stimulations fit a parabolic response surface (PRS), allowing us to identify and optimize the best drug combinations by testing only a small fraction of the total search space. Previously, we used PRS methodology to identify three regimens (PRS Regimens I-III) that in murine models are much more effective than the standard regimen used to treat TB. However, PRS Regimens I and II are unsuitable for treating drug-resistant TB and PRS Regimen III includes an experimental drug. Here, we use PRS methodology to identify from an expanded pool of drugs new highly effective near-universal drug regimens comprising only approved drugs.
We evaluated combinations of 15 different drugs in a human macrophage TB model and identified the most promising 4-drug combinations. We then tested 14 of these combinations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected BALB/c mice and chose for PRS dose optimization and further study the two most potent regimens, designated PRS Regimens IV and V, consisting of clofazimine (CFZ), bedaquiline (BDQ), pyrazinamide (PZA), and either amoxicillin/clavulanate (AC) or delamanid (DLM), respectively. We then evaluated the efficacy in mice of optimized PRS Regimens IV and V, as well as a 3-drug regimen, PRS Regimen VI (CFZ, BDQ, and PZA), and compared their efficacy to PRS Regimen III (CFZ, BDQ, PZA, and SQ109), previously shown to reduce the time to achieve relapse-free cure in mice by 80% compared with the Standard Regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, PZA, and ethambutol). Efficacy measurements included early bactericidal activity, time to lung sterilization, and time to relapse-free cure. PRS Regimens III-VI all rapidly sterilized the lungs and achieved relapse-free cure in 3 weeks (PRS Regimens III, V, and VI) or 5 weeks (PRS Regimen IV). In contrast, mice treated with the Standard Regimen still had high numbers of bacteria in their lungs after 6-weeks treatment and none achieved relapse-free cure in this time-period.
We have identified three new regimens that rapidly sterilize the lungs of mice and dramatically shorten the time required to achieve relapse-free cure. All mouse drug doses in these regimens extrapolate to doses that are readily achievable in humans. Because PRS Regimens IV and V contain only one first line drug (PZA) and exclude fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, they should be effective against most TB cases that are multidrug resistant (MDR-TB) and many that are extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB). Hence, these regimens have potential to shorten dramatically the time required for treatment of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. If clinical trials confirm that these regimens dramatically shorten the time required to achieve relapse-free cure in humans, then this radically shortened treatment has the potential to improve treatment compliance, decrease the emergence of drug resistance, and decrease the healthcare burden of treating both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB.",,,,2019-05-11,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
31063472,Genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains circulating in Botswana.,,PloS one,"Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) isolates can inform Tuberculosis (TB) control programs on the relative proportion of transmission driving the TB epidemic. There is limited data on the M. tb genotypes that are circulating in Botswana. The aim of this study was to generate baseline data on the genetic diversity of M.tb isolates circulating in the country.
A total of 461 M.tb isolates received at the Botswana National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory between March 2012 and October 2013 were included in this study. Drug susceptibility testing was conducted using the BD BACTEC MGIT 960 System. M.tb strains were genotyped using spoligotyping and spoligotype patterns were compared with existing patterns in the SITVIT Web database. A subset of drug resistant isolates which formed spoligo clusters (n = 65) was additionally genotyped with 12-loci MIRU. Factors associated with drug resistance and clustering were evaluated using logistic regression.
Of the 461 isolates genotyped, 458 showed 108 distinct spoligotype patterns. The predominant M.tb lineages were Lineage 4 (81.9%), Lineage 2 (9%) and Lineage 1 (7.2%). The predominant spoligotype families within Lineage 4 were LAM (33%), S (14%), T (16%), X (16%). Three hundred and ninety-two (86%) isolates could be grouped into 44 clusters (2-46 isolates per cluster); giving a clustering rate of 76%. We identified 173 (37.8%) drug resistant isolates, 48 (10.5%) of these were multi-drug resistant. MIRU typing of the drug resistant isolates allowed grouping of 46 isolates into 14 clusters, giving a clustering rate of 49.2%.

Effective chemotherapy has been used and improved since the 1950s, but strains resistant to this therapy and most antibacterial drugs on the market are emerging. Only 10 new drugs are in clinical trials, and two of them have already demonstrated resistance. This paper gives an overview of current treatment options against tuberculosis and points out a promising approach of discovering new effective drugs. The serine production pathway is composed of three enzymes (SerA1, SerC and SerB2), which are considered essential for bacterial growth, and all of them are considered as a therapeutic drug target. Their crystal structure are described and essential regulatory domains pointed out. Sequence alignment with similar enzymes in other host would help to identify key residues to target in order to achieve selective inhibition. Currently, only inhibitors of SerB2 are described in the literature. However, inhibitors of human enzymes are discussed, and could be used as a good starting point for a drug discovery program. The aim of this paper is to give some guidance for the design of new hits for every enzyme in this pathway.",,,,2019-05-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
30978186,Insights into the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Tanzania.,,PloS one,"Human tuberculosis (TB) is caused by seven phylogenetic lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), Lineage 1-7. Recent advances in rapid genotyping of MTBC based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), allow for phylogenetically robust strain classification, paving the way for defining genotype-phenotype relationships in clinical settings. Such studies have revealed that, in addition to host and environmental factors, strain variation in the MTBC influences the outcome of TB infection and disease. In Tanzania, such molecular epidemiological studies of TB however are scarce in spite of a high TB burden.
Here we used SNP-typing to characterize a nationwide collection of 2,039 MTBC clinical isolates representative of 1.6% of all new and retreatment TB cases notified in Tanzania during 2012 and 2013. Four lineages, namely Lineage 1-4 were identified within the study population. The distribution and frequency of these lineages varied across regions but overall, Lineage 4 was the most frequent (n = 866, 42.5%), followed by Lineage 3 (n = 681, 33.4%) and 1 (n = 336, 16.5%), with Lineage 2 being the least frequent (n = 92, 4.5%). We found Lineage 2 to be independently associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.31 - 3.50, p = 0.002) and retreatment cases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 0.95 - 2.84, p = 0. 065) in the study population. We found no associations between MTBC lineage and patient age or HIV status. Our sublineage typing based on spacer oligotyping on a subset of Lineage 1, 3 and 4 strains revealed the presence of mainly EAI, CAS and LAM families. Finally, we detected low levels of multidrug resistant isolates among a subset of 144 retreatment cases.

Under the Global Fund programmatic management of drug-resistant TB (2006-13), we assessed the attrition and delay in the pathway and the factors associated.
Cohort study involving secondary programme data. All patients identified as presumptive MDR-TB (defined as i) previously treated TB patients which included recurrent TB, return after loss to follow up, treatment after failure and ii) new TB patients that were non-converters at three months of treatment or in close contact with a known MDR-TB patient) during October 2006 to June 2013 were eligible for phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). Pre-diagnosis attrition (presumptive MDR-TB not undergoing culture and DST) and pre-treatment attrition (confirmed MDR-TB patients not initiated on treatment) was calculated. Diagnosis delay was the time interval from DST eligibility to DST result, treatment initiation delay was fom DST result to treatment initiation and total delay was from DST eligbility to treatment initiation. Factors associated with attrition and delay were identified using log binomial regression and linear regression, respectively.
Of 78 564 presumptive MDR-TB patients, 2 470 (3.1%) underwent pre-diagnosis attrition. Of 9 283 MDR-TB patients, 3 361 (36.2%) underwent pre-treatment attrition.

The recommendation was based on successful clinical trials conducted in Asia and Africa, but studies, using mainly European data, have shown few patients in higher-resource settings would meet WHO eligibility criteria.
We assessed eligibility for the shorter regimen among US MDR-TB cases that had full drug susceptibility testing (DST) results and were reported during 2011-2016 to the US National TB Surveillance System. We estimated costs by applying the eligibility criteria for the shorter regimen, and proportional inpatient/outpatient costs from a previous, population-based study, to all MDR-TB patients reported to the National TB Surveillance System.
Of 586 reported MDR-TB cases, 10% (59) were eligible for the shorter regimen.

There is limited evidence on the willingness of MDR-TB HHCs to take MDR-TB preventive therapy (MDR TPT) to decrease their risk of TB disease.
In this cross-sectional study of HHCs of MDR-TB and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) index cases from 16 clinical research sites in 8 countries, enrollees were interviewed to assess willingness to take a hypothetical, newly developed MDR TPT if offered. To identify factors associated with willingness to take MDR TPT, a marginal logistic model was fitted using generalized estimating equations to account for household-level clustering.
From 278 MDR-TB/RR-TB index case households, 743 HHCs were enrolled; the median age of HHCs was 33 (interquartile range, 22-49) years, and 62% were women. HHC willingness to take hypothetical MDR TPT was high (79%) and remained high even with the potential for mild side effects (70%). Increased willingness was significantly associated with current employment or schooling (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.83 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.07-3.13]), appropriate TB-related knowledge (aOR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.23-3.99]), confidence in taking MDR TPT (aOR, 7.16 [95% CI, 3.33-15.42]), and being comfortable telling others about taking MDR TPT (aOR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.29-4.06]).

Linezolid use carries a considerable risk of toxicity, with the optimal dose and duration remaining unclear. Current guidelines are mainly based on evidence from observational non-comparative studies.
To assess the efficacy of linezolid when used as part of a second-line regimen for treating people with MDR and XDR pulmonary tuberculosis, and to assess the prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with linezolid use in this patient group.
We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Specialized Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; and LILACS up to 13 July 2018. We also checked article reference lists and contacted researchers in the field.
We included studies in which some participants received linezolid, and others did not. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of linezolid for MDR and XDR pulmonary tuberculosis to evaluate efficacy outcomes. We added non-randomized cohort studies to evaluate adverse events.Primary outcomes were all-cause and tuberculosis-associated death, treatment failure, and cure. Secondary outcomes were treatment interrupted, treatment completed, and time to sputum culture conversion. We recorded frequency of all and serious adverse events, adverse events leading to drug discontinuation or dose reduction, and adverse events attributed to linezolid, particularly neuropathy, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia.
Two review authors (BS and DC) independently assessed the search results for eligibility and extracted data from included studies. All review authors assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data when necessary.We were unable to perform a meta-analysis as one of the RCTs adopted a study design where participants in the study group received linezolid immediately and participants in the control group received linezolid after two months, and therefore there were no comparable data from this trial. We deemed meta-analysis of non-randomized study data inappropriate.
We identified three RCTs for inclusion. One of these studies had serious problems with allocation of the study drug and placebo, so we could not analyse data for intervention effect from it. The remaining two RCTs recruited 104 participants. One randomized 65 participants to receive linezolid or not, in addition to a background regimen; the other randomized 39 participants to addition of linezolid to a background regimen immediately, or after a delay of two months. We included 14 non-randomized cohort studies (two prospective, 12 retrospective), with a total of 1678 participants.Settings varied in terms of income and tuberculosis burden. One RCT and 7 out of 14 non-randomized studies commenced recruitment in or after 2009. All RCT participants and 38.7% of non-randomized participants were reported to have XDR-TB.Dosing and duration of linezolid in studies were variable and reported inconsistently. Daily doses ranged from 300 mg to 1200 mg; some studies had planned dose reduction for all participants after a set time, others had incompletely reported dose reductions for some participants, and most did not report numbers of participants receiving each dose. Mean or median duration of linezolid therapy was longer than 90 days in eight of the 14 non-randomized cohorts that reported this information.Duration of participant follow-up varied between RCTs. Only five out of 14 non-randomized studies reported follow-up duration.Both RCTs were at low risk of reporting bias and unclear risk of selection bias. One RCT was at high risk of performance and detection bias, and low risk for attrition bias, for all outcomes. The other RCT was at low risk of detection and attrition bias for the primary outcome, with unclear risk of detection and attrition bias for non-primary outcomes, and unclear risk of performance bias for all outcomes. Overall risk of bias for the non-randomized studies was critical for three studies, and serious for the remaining 11.One RCT reported higher cure (risk ratio (RR) 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 4.90, very low-certainty evidence), lower failure (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.70, very low-certainty evidence), and higher sputum culture conversion at 24 months (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.40, very low-certainty evidence), amongst the linezolid-treated group than controls, with no differences in other primary and secondary outcomes. This study also found more anaemia (17/33 versus 2/32), nausea and vomiting, and neuropathy (14/33 versus 1/32) events amongst linezolid-receiving participants. Linezolid was discontinued early and permanently in two of 33 (6.1%) participants who received it.The other RCT reported higher sputum culture conversion four months after randomization (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.28), amongst the group who received linezolid immediately compared to the group who had linezolid initiation delayed by two months. Linezolid was discontinued early and permanently in seven of 39 (17.9%) participants who received it.Linezolid discontinuation occurred in 22.6% (141/624; 11 studies), of participants in the non-randomized studies. Total, serious, and linezolid-attributed adverse events could not be summarized quantitatively or comparatively, due to incompleteness of data on duration of follow-up and numbers of participants experiencing events.
We found some evidence of efficacy of linezolid for drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis from RCTs in participants with XDR-TB but adverse events and discontinuation of linezolid were common. Overall, there is a lack of comparative data on efficacy and safety. Serious risk of bias and heterogeneity in conducting and reporting non-randomized studies makes the existing, mostly retrospective, data difficult to interpret. Further prospective cohort studies or RCTs in high tuberculosis burden low-income and lower-middle-income countries would be useful to inform policymakers and clinicians of the efficacy and safety of linezolid as a component of drug-resistant TB treatment regimens.",,,,2019-03-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Recently, several clinical trials of ""universal"" drug regimens, aiming to treat drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, have included a fluoroquinolone. In the absence of clinical data comparing their side-by-side efficacies in controlled MDR-TB trials, a pharmacological rationale is needed to guide the selection of the most efficacious fluoroquinolone. The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that fluoroquinolone concentrations (pharmacokinetics) and activity (pharmacodynamics) at the site of infection are better predictors of efficacy than the plasma concentrations and potency measured in standard growth inhibition assays and are better suited to determinations of whether one of the fluoroquinolones outperforms the others in rabbits with active TB. We first measured the penetration of these fluoroquinolones in lung lesion compartments, and their potency against bacterial populations that reside in each compartment, to compute lesion-centric pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters. PK modeling methods were used to quantify drug penetration from plasma to tissues at human-equivalent doses. On the basis of these metrics, moxifloxacin emerged with a clear advantage, whereas plasma-based PK/PD favored levofloxacin (the ranges of the plasma AUC/MIC ratio [i.e., the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC] are 46 to 86 for moxifloxacin and 74 to 258 for levofloxacin). A comparative efficacy trial in the rabbit model of active TB demonstrated the superiority of moxifloxacin in reducing bacterial burden at the lesion level and in sterilizing cellular and necrotic lesions. Collectively, these results show that PK/PD data obtained at the site of infection represent an adequate predictor of drug efficacy against TB and constitute the baseline required to explore synergies, antagonism, and drug-drug interactions in fluoroquinolone-containing regimens.",,,,2019-02-26,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The development of new efficient regimens with shorter treatment durations for MDR-TB will solve these issues and improve treatment outcomes.
This study is a phase II/III, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial of non-inferiority design comparing a new regimen to the World Health Organization-endorsed conventional regimen for fluoroquinolone-sensitive MDR-TB. The control arm uses a conventional treatment regimen with second-line drugs including injectables for 20-24 months. The investigational arm uses a new shorter regimen including delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide for 9 or 12 months depending on time to sputum culture conversion. The primary outcome is the treatment success rate at 24 months after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes include time to sputum culture conversion on liquid and solid media, proportions of sputum culture conversion on liquid media after 2 and 6 months of treatment, treatment success rate according to pyrazinamide resistance, and occurrence of adverse events grade 3 and above as evaluated by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Based on an α = 0.025 level of significance (one-sided test), a power of 80%, and a < 10% difference in treatment success rate between the control and investigational arms (80% vs. 70%) when the anticipated actual success rate in the treatment group is assumed to be 90%, the number of participants needed per arm to show non-inferiority of the investigational regimen was calculated as 48. Additionally, assuming the proportion of fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR-TB among participants as 50%, and 5% loss to follow-up, the number of participants is calculated as N/( 0.50 × 0.95), resulting in 102 persons per group (204 in total).
This trial will reveal the effectiveness and safety of a new shorter regimen comprising four oral drugs, including delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide, for the treatment of fluoroquinolone-sensitive MDR-TB. Results from this trial will provide evidence for adopting a shorter and more convenient treatment regimen for MDR-TB.

Respiratory medicine,"Delamanid is one of two recently approved drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of delamanid in the first 6 months of treatment.
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 17 sites in seven countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Peru, the Philippines, and South Africa). We enrolled eligible adults (>18 years) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive, in combination with an optimised background regimen developed according to WHO and national guidelines, either oral delamanid (100 mg twice daily) for 2 months followed by 200 mg once daily for 4 months or placebo (same regimen). Patients were centrally randomised (2:1) and stratified by risk category for delayed sputum culture conversion. Primary outcomes were the time to sputum culture conversion over 6 months and the difference in the distribution of time to sputum culture conversion over 6 months between the two groups, as assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01424670.
Between Sept 2, 2011, and Nov 27, 2013, we screened 714 patients, of whom 511 were randomly assigned (341 to delamanid plus optimised background regimen [delamanid group] and 170 to placebo plus optimised background regimen [placebo group]) and formed the safety analysis population. 327 patients were culture-positive for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at baseline and comprised the efficacy analysis population (226 in the delamanid group and 101 in the placebo group). Median time to sputum culture conversion did not differ between the two groups (p=0·0562; modified Peto-Peto), with 51 days (IQR 29-98) in the delamanid group and 57 days (43-85) in the placebo group; the hazard ratio was 1·17 (95% CI 0·91-1·51, p=0·2157). 501 (98·0%) of 511 patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. 136 (26·6%) of 511 patients had at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event; the incidence was similar between treatment groups (89 [26·1%] of 341 patients for delamanid and 47 [27·6%] of 170 for placebo). Deaths related to treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups (15 [4·4%] of 341 for delamanid and six [3·5%] of 170 for placebo). No deaths were considered to be related to delamanid.
The reduction in median time to sputum culture conversion over 6 months was not significant in the primary analysis. Delamanid was well tolerated with a highly characterised safety profile. Further evaluation of delamanid is needed to determine its role in a rapidly evolving standard of care.

A total of 1007 HHCs of 284 index cases were enrolled in eight countries. HIV status was known at enrolment for 226 (22%) HHCs; 39 (4%) were HIV-positive. HIV testing was offered to 769 (98%) of the 781 remaining HHCs; 544 (71%) agreed to testing. Of 535 who were actually tested, 26 (5%) were HIV-infected. HIV testing uptake varied by site (median 86%, range 0-100%; 
HIV testing of HHCs of MDR-TB index cases is feasible and high-yield, with 5% testing positive. Reasons for low test uptake among children and at specific sites-including sites with high HIV prevalence-require further study to ensure all persons at risk for HIV are aware of their status.

Studies have explored the status of antituberculosis drug (ATD) resistance in different regions of China. However, few studies have focused on DR-TB in Sichuan to date. Due to the large population in Sichuan, detailed investigations of the DR-TB burden in Sichuan are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the drug resistance characteristics of TB isolates from tuberculosis patients with and without HIV (TB-HIV patients and TBw/oHIV patients) in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
Isolates from respiratory samples of TBw/oHIV patients and TB-HIV patients hospitalized between January 2014 and December 2017 were collected. Nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) were excluded. Drug sensitivity testing (DST) was performed according to the dilution method in microplates with 4 first-line ATDs and 8 second-line ATDs. TB strains were separated according to patient treatment history, patient age, calendar year and GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) assay results for further analysis.
For the 7470 patients recruited, the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) rate was 2.1-fold (14.6% vs. 6.8%) higher than the national baseline level. The repeatedly admitted patients were more likely to have a resistance profile than the first-time-admitted cases in both the TB-only group (P<0.05) and the TB-HIV corresponding group (P<0.05). Among the 7273 TBw/oHIV cases and 197 TB-HIV cases, the positivity rates of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the TB-HIV group were significantly lower than those in the TBw/oHIV group (P<0.05). The repeatedly admitted TB-HIV patients had lower resistance rates to INH than the repeatedly admitted TBw/oHIV patients (24.4% vs. 41.5%, P<0.05). The Rifampicin-resistant TB strains in the TBw/oHIV group were more likely to be resistant to INH in the repeatedly admitted group than those in the first-time admitted patients (P<0.05). The proportions of XDR (3.6% vs. 1.3%, P<0.05) and XDR-TB/MDR-TB (7.3% vs. 2.2%, P<0.05) in all TB-HIV patients were significantly higher than those in all TBw/oHIV patients.

Long delays in the initiation of treatment are a barrier to MDR-TB control.
The main objectives of this study were (1) to identify the determinants of delay in treatment initiation after MDR-TB diagnosis, and (2) to explore the effects of treatment delay on disease infectivity, severity, treatment adherence, and treatment outcomes.
This retrospective study reviewed 330 MDR-TB treatment cards for patients enrolled for treatment at Yangon Regional Tuberculosis Centre, in 2014.
Median treatment delay was 105 days, interquartile range (IQR) 106 (61-167) days; (51.5%) of patients experienced a long treatment delay (≥ 105 days). Regarding the determinants of treatment delay, this study identified important patient-healthcare system interaction factors. Significant risk factors of long treatment delay included female sex, age > 30 years, and prior contact with patients with MDR-TB. Patients with long treatment delays were significantly different from those with short delays, in terms of having high sputum smear grade, resistance to more than two main drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin), and long culture conversion time. In this study, delay in the initiation of treatment was associated with poor treatment outcome, but this was not statistically significant after adjusting for other risk factors. Median treatment-delay times were longer among patients with poor outcomes (144 days) than those with successful outcomes (102 days).
Post-diagnosis delays in the initiation of treatment among MDR-TB patients were significantly long. The study results showed that inadequate MDR-TB treatment initiation center, centralization of treatment initiation, limitation of human resources, were health-system factors delaying timely treatment initiation and implementation of an effective TB-control program. Our findings highlight the need for immediate interventions to reduce treatment delay and improve treatment outcomes, including scaling up diagnostic capacity with Xpert MTB/RIF at township level, expansion of decentralized MDR-TB treatment initiation centers, ensuring a productive health workforce comprising trained health personnel, and providing health education and treatment-adherence counseling to patients and family members.",,"Median treatment delay was 105 days, interquartile range (IQR) 106 (61-167) days; (51.5%) of patients experienced a long treatment delay (≥ 105 days).

30580758,Effect of the duration of antimicrobial exposure on the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) for macrolide antibiotics: protocol for a systematic review with a network meta-analysis.,"Antimicrobial resistance, Carriage, Disease recurrence, Macrolides, Network meta-analysis, Prescriptions, Resistance mechanisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Treatment duration, Treatment failure",Systematic reviews,"Antimicrobial resistance generates a huge health and economic burden and has the potential to become the leading cause of death globally, but its underlying drivers are yet to be fully described. The association between a microbe's exposure to antimicrobials and subsequent development of, or selection for, resistance is well documented, as are the exacerbating microbial and human factors. However, the nature and extent of this risk, and how it varies by antimicrobial class and duration of treatment, is poorly defined. The goal of our systematic review and network meta-analysis is to determine the relationship between the duration of antimicrobial exposure and selection for resistance. We will use macrolides as the antimicrobial class of interest and Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage as an indicator organism. Our secondary outcomes include duration of symptoms, risk of treatment failure and recurrence, and descriptions of resistance mechanisms.
We will conduct a systematic review, selecting studies if they are published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which report the relationship between taking a macrolide for any indication and incidence of resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients of any age group. We will use a predefined search strategy to identify studies meeting these eligibility criteria in MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of RCTs. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts, review the full texts and undertake data extraction. We will use the Cochrane Collaboration's tool to assess the quality of included RCTs. If feasible, we will perform pair-wise meta-analysis modelling to determine the relationship between the duration of macrolide treatment and development of macrolide resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. If the identified studies meet the assumptions for a network meta-analysis (NMA), we will additionally model this relationship using indirect comparisons. Our protocol utilises reporting guidance by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and the extensions for protocols (PRISMA-P) and network meta-analyses (PRISMA for NMA). Our review will also report to these standards.
Establishing the relationship between the duration of antimicrobial exposure and development of, or selection for, resistance will inform the design of antimicrobial prescriptions, treatment guidelines and the behaviour of both physicians and patients. This work will therefore be a strong contribution towards the full realisation of current antimicrobial resistance stewardship strategies.

Treating individuals with MDR-TB infection to prevent progression to disease could be an effective public health strategy. Young children are at high risk of developing TB disease following infection and are commonly infected by an adult in their household. Identifying young children with household exposure to MDR-TB and providing them with MDR-TB preventive therapy could reduce the risk of disease progression. To date, no trials of MDR-TB preventive therapy have been completed and World Health Organization guidelines suggest close observation with no active treatment.
The tuberculosis child multidrug-resistant preventive therapy (TB-CHAMP) trial is a phase III cluster randomised placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of levofloxacin in young child contacts of MDR-TB cases. The trial is taking place at three sites in South Africa where adults with MDR-TB are identified. If a child aged < 5 years lives in their household, we assess the adult index case, screen all household members for TB disease and evaluate any child aged < 5 years for trial eligibility. Eligible children are randomised by household to receive daily levofloxacin (15-20 mg/kg) or matching placebo for six months. Children are closely monitored for disease development, drug tolerability and adverse events. The primary endpoint is incident TB disease or TB death by one year after recruitment. We will enrol 1556 children from approximately 778 households with an average of two eligible children per household. Recruitment will run for 18-24 months with all children followed for 18 months after treatment. Qualitative and health economic evaluations are embedded in the trial.
If the TB-CHAMP trial demonstrates that levofloxacin is effective in preventing TB disease in young children who have been exposed to MDR-TB and that it is safe, well tolerated, acceptable and cost-effective, we would expect that that this intervention would rapidly transfer into policy.

Development of bedaquiline and delamanid has potentially changed the treatment landscape for MDR-TB. This review provides an update on the progress of these novel antitubercular agents. We review published studies aimed at evaluating clinical efficacy and effectiveness of bedaquiline and delamanid. Five prospective clinical studies and seven retrospective studies on bedaquiline showed that patients treated with a bedaquiline-containing regimen had a high culture conversion rate ranging from 65 to 100% and a satisfactory treatment outcome. The combined use with linezolid might add to the effectiveness of bedaquiline. Controversies about bedaquiline resistance are discussed. Three clinical trials have reported outcomes on delamanid and showed that introducing delamanid to a background regimen improved culture conversion rate at 2 months from 29.6% to more than 40%. A higher favorable treatment rate was also observed among patients who received delamanid for more than 6 months, but about a quarter of patients defaulted in the control group. Seven retrospective studies were summarized and found a treatment benefit as well. More reliable evidence from randomized clinical trials reporting on the treatment outcomes is needed urgently to support a strong recommendation for the use of delamanid.

However only a tiny proportion of TB patients in the world have access to isoniazid drug susceptibility testing-the widely implemented Xpert MTB/RIF technology only tests for resistance to rifampicin. Patients with isoniazid mono resistance that is not identified at baseline are treated with a standard regimen that effectively results in rifampicin mono-therapy during the latter four months of the six month treatment course, exposing remaining viable organisms to a single agent and greatly increasing the risk of development of multi drug-resistant TB. Unusually, Peru has pioneered universal pre-treatment drug susceptibility testing with methods that identify isoniazid resistance and has thus identified a large number of individuals requiring tailored therapy. Since 2010, treatment in Peru for isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis without multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (Hr-TB) has been with a standardized nine-month regimen of levofloxacin, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the outcomes of treatment for patients with Hr-TB initiating treatment with this regimen between January 2012 and December 2014 and to determine factors affecting these outcomes.
Retrospective cross-sectional study; case data were obtained from the national registry of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Patients diagnosed with isoniazid resistant TB without resistance to rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and quinolones as determined by either a rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) (nitrate reductase test, MODS, Genotype MTBDRplus) or by the proportion method were included.
A total of 947 cases were evaluated (a further 403 without treatment end date were excluded), with treatment success in 77.2% (731 cases), loss to follow-up in 19.7% (186 cases), treatment failure in 1.2% (12 cases), and death in 1.9% (18 cases). Unfavorable outcomes were associated in multivariate analysis with male gender (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.72, p<0.05), lack of rapid DST (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91, p = 0.01), additional use of an injectable second-line anti-tuberculous drug (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.70, p<0.05), and treatment initiation in 2014 (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.94, p = 0.01).

We performed a 28-day gatifloxacin hollow-fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB) study in order to identify the target exposures associated with optimal kill rates and resistance suppression. Monte Carlo experiments (MCE) were used to identify the dose that would achieve the target exposure in 10000 adult patients with meningeal or pulmonary MDR-TB. The optimal doses identified were validated using probit analyses of clinical data from 2 prospective clinical trials of patients with pulmonary and meningeal tuberculosis. Classification and regression-tree (CART) analyses were used to identify the gatifloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) below which patients failed or relapsed on combination therapy.
The target exposure associated with optimal microbial kill rates and resistance suppression in the HFS-TB was a 0-24 hour area under the concentration-time curve-to-MIC of 184. MCE identified an optimal gatifloxacin dose of 800 mg/day for pulmonary and 1200 mg/day for meningeal MDR-TB, and a clinical susceptibility breakpoint of MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L.

Infectious diseases,"Linezolid improves the treatment outcomes of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis substantially. We investigated whether use of linezolid instead of ethambutol increases the proportion of sputum culture conversion at 8 weeks of treatment in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
We did a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, open-label trial for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis at the three affiliated hospitals to Seoul National University and National Medical Center (Seoul-Seongnam, South Korea). Patients, aged 20-80 years, with a positive sputum for pulmonary tuberculosis, but without resistance to rifampicin, and current treatment administered for 7 days or fewer, were randomly assigned at a 1:1:1 ratio into three groups. The control group received ethambutol (2 months) with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. The second group used linezolid (600 mg/day) for 2 weeks and the third group for 4 weeks instead of ethambutol for 2 months. We used a minimisation method to randomise, and stratified according to institution, cavitation on chest radiographs, and diabetes. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with negative culture conversion of sputum in liquid media after 8 weeks of treatment. The results of this trial were analysed primarily in the modified intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01994460.
Between Feb 19, 2014, and Jan 13, 2017, a total of 429 patients were enrolled and 428 were randomly assigned into either the control group (142 patients), the linezolid 2 weeks group (143 patients), or the linezolid 4 weeks group (143 patients). Among them, 401 were eligible for primary efficacy analyses. In the modified intention-to-treat analyses, negative cultures in liquid media at 8 weeks of treatment were observed in 103 (76·9%) of 134 control patients, 111 (82·2%) of 135 in the linezolid 2 weeks group, and 100 (75·8%) of 132 in the linezolid 4 weeks groups. The difference from the control group was 5.4% (95% CI -4·3 to 15·0, p=0·28) for the linezolid 2 weeks group and -1·1% (-11·3 to 9·1, p=0·83) for the linezolid 4 weeks group. Numbers of patients who experienced at least one adverse event were similar across the groups (86 [62·8%] of 137 in control, 79 [57·2%] of 138 in the linezolid 2 weeks group, and 75 [62·0%] of 121 in the linezolid 4 weeks group). Resistance to linezolid was not identified in any patient.
Higher rates of culture conversion at 8 weeks of treatment with short-term use of linezolid were not observed. However, safety analyses and the resistance profile suggested the potential role of linezolid in shortening of treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis.

30474434,Intensified antibiotic treatment of tuberculosis meningitis.,"TB meningitis, Tuberculous meningitis, antituberculous therapy, intensified",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,"Meningitis is the most severe manifestation of tuberculosis, resulting in death or disability in over 50% of those affected, with even higher morbidity and mortality among patients with HIV or drug resistance. Antimicrobial treatment of Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is similar to treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, although some drugs show poor central nervous system penetration. Therefore, intensification of antibiotic treatment may improve TBM treatment outcomes. Areas covered: In this review, we address three main areas: available data for old and new anti-tuberculous agents; intensified treatment in specific patient groups like HIV co-infection, drug-resistance, and children; and optimal research strategies. Expert commentary: There is good evidence from preclinical, clinical, and modeling studies to support the use of high-dose rifampicin in TBM, likely to be at least 30 mg/kg. Higher dose isoniazid could be beneficial, especially in rapid acetylators. The role of other first and second line drugs is unclear, but observational data suggest that linezolid, which has good brain penetration, may be beneficial. We advocate the use of molecular pharmacological approaches, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies to define optimal regimens to be tested in clinical trials. Exciting data from recent studies hold promise for improved regimens and better clinical outcomes in future.",,,,2018-11-27,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

It is still considered one of the ten most common epidemiologic causes of death in the world. As a transmissible disease, it is initiated by rod-shaped (bacillus) mycobacteria. The management of tuberculosis became possible owing to several discoveries beginning in 1882 with the isolation of the TB bacillus by Robert Koch. The diagnosis of TB was enabled by finding a staining method for TB bacteria identification (1883). It was soon realized that a large-scale policy for the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis was necessary, which resulted in the foundation of International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (1902). An antituberculosis vaccine was developed in 1921 and has been in therapeutic use since then. TB treatment regimens have changed over the decades and the latest recommendations are known as Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS, WHO 1993).
A search of bibliographic databases was performed for peer-reviewed research literature. A focused review question and inclusion criteria were applied. Standard tools were used to assess the quality of retrieved papers.
A total of 112 papers were included comprising original publications and reviews. The paper overviews anti-TB drugs according to their mechanism of action. The chemical structure, metabolism and unwanted effects of such drugs have been discussed. The most recent treatment regimens and new drugs, including those in clinical trials, are also presented.

In 3,405 participants included in analyses, baseline smear grade of 3+ relative to <2+, HIV seropositivity and adherence of ≤90% were significant risk factors for unfavorable outcome. Four-month regimens were non-inferior in participants with minimal disease defined by <2+ sputum smear grade or non-cavitary disease.

In order to maintain strong TB control programmes, it is vital that the experiences of people who receive long-term injectables for TB are well understood. To investigate the feasibility of a novel model of care delivery, a clinical trial (The TB-RROC Study) was conducted at two central hospitals in Malawi. Hospital-based care was compared to a community-based approach for patients on TB retreatment in which 'guardians' (patient-nominated lay people) were trained to deliver injections to patients at home. This study is the qualitative evaluation of the TB-RROC trial. It examines the experiences of people receiving injectables as part of TB treatment delivered in hospital and community-based settings.
A qualitative evaluation of the TB-RROC intervention was conducted using phenomenographic methods. Trial participants were purposively sampled, and in-depth interviews were conducted with patients and guardians in both arms of the trial. Key informant interviews and observations in the wards and community were performed. Thematic content analysis was used to derive analytical themes.
Fourteen patients, 12 guardians and 9 key informants were interviewed. Three key themes relating to TB retreatment emerged: medical experiences (including symptoms, treatment, and HIV); the effects of the physical environment (conditions on the ward, disruption to daily routines and livelihoods); and trust (in other people, the community and in the health system). Experiences were affected by the nature of a person's prior role in their community and resulted in a range of emotional responses. Patients and guardians in the community benefited from better environment, social interactions and financial stability. Concerns were expressed about the potential for patients' health or relationships to be adversely affected in the community. These potential concerns were rarely realised.

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert a) for extrapulmonary TB by site of disease in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB; and b) for rifampicin resistance in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB.
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Registry, and ProQuest up to 7 August 2017 without language restriction.
We included diagnostic accuracy studies of Xpert in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB. We included TB meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, and disseminated TB. We used culture as the reference standard. For pleural TB, we also included a composite reference standard, which defined a positive result as the presence of granulomatous inflammation or a positive culture result. For rifampicin resistance, we used culture-based drug susceptibility testing or MTBDRplus as the reference standard.
Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. We determined pooled predicted sensitivity and specificity for TB, grouped by type of extrapulmonary specimen, and for rifampicin resistance. For TB detection, we used a bivariate random-effects model. Recognizing that use of culture may lead to misclassification of cases of extrapulmonary TB as 'not TB' owing to the paucibacillary nature of the disease, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta-analysis model. For rifampicin resistance detection, we performed univariate meta-analyses for sensitivity and specificity separately to include studies in which no rifampicin resistance was detected. We used theoretical populations with an assumed prevalence to provide illustrative numbers of patients with false positive and false negative results.
We included 66 unique studies that evaluated 16,213 specimens for detection of extrapulmonary TB and rifampicin resistance. We identified only one study that evaluated the newest test version, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), for TB meningitis. Fifty studies (76%) took place in low- or middle-income countries. Risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains and was high or unclear for the reference standard domain (most of these studies decontaminated sterile specimens before culture inoculation). Regarding applicability, in the patient selection domain, we scored high or unclear concern for most studies because either patients were evaluated exclusively as inpatients at tertiary care centres, or we were not sure about the clinical settings.Pooled Xpert sensitivity (defined by culture) varied across different types of specimens (31% in pleural tissue to 97% in bone or joint fluid); Xpert sensitivity was > 80% in urine and bone or joint fluid and tissue. Pooled Xpert specificity (defined by culture) varied less than sensitivity (82% in bone or joint tissue to 99% in pleural fluid and urine). Xpert specificity was ≥ 98% in cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, urine, and peritoneal fluid.Xpert testing in cerebrospinal fluidXpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible interval (CrI)) against culture were 71.1% (60.9% to 80.4%) and 98.0% (97.0% to 98.8%), respectively (29 studies, 3774 specimens; moderate-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have TB meningitis on culture, 89 would be Xpert-positive: of these, 18 (20%) would not have TB (false-positives); and 911 would be Xpert-negative: of these, 29 (3%) would have TB (false-negatives).For TB meningitis, ultra sensitivity and specificity against culture (95% confidence interval (CI)) were 90% (55% to 100%) and 90% (83% to 95%), respectively (one study, 129 participants).Xpert testing in pleural fluidXpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 50.9% (39.7% to 62.8%) and 99.2% (98.2% to 99.7%), respectively (27 studies, 4006 specimens; low-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 150 have pleural TB on culture, 83 would be Xpert-positive: of these, seven (8%) would not have TB (false-positives); and 917 would be Xpert-negative: of these, 74 (8%) would have TB (false-negatives).Xpert testing in urineXpert pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CrI) against culture were 82.7% (69.6% to 91.1%) and 98.7% (94.8% to 99.7%), respectively (13 studies, 1199 specimens; moderate-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 70 have genitourinary TB on culture, 70 would be Xpert-positive: of these, 12 (17%) would not have TB (false-positives); and 930 would be Xpert-negative: of these, 12 (1%) would have TB (false-negatives).Xpert testing for rifampicin resistanceXpert pooled sensitivity (20 studies, 148 specimens) and specificity (39 studies, 1088 specimens) were 95.0% (89.7% to 97.9%) and 98.7% (97.8% to 99.4%), respectively (high-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 120 have rifampicin-resistant TB, 125 would be positive for rifampicin-resistant TB: of these, 11 (9%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false-positives); and 875 would be negative for rifampicin-resistant TB: of these, 6 (1%) would have rifampicin resistance (false-negatives).For lymph node TB, the accuracy of culture, the reference standard used, presented a greater concern for bias than in other forms of extrapulmonary TB.
In people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB, Xpert may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Xpert sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens, while for most specimens, specificity is high, the test rarely yielding a positive result for people without TB (defined by culture). Xpert is accurate for detection of rifampicin resistance. For people with presumed TB meningitis, treatment should be based on clinical judgement, and not withheld solely on an Xpert result, as is common practice when culture results are negative.",,,,2018-08-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
30133504,"Risk factors for mortality among adults registered on the routine drug resistant tuberculosis reporting database in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, 2011 to 2013.",,PloS one,"South Africa is among countries with the highest burden of drug resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). The Eastern Cape Province reported the highest MDR-TB mortality rates in South Africa for the 2010 treatment cohorts. This study aimed to determine risk factors for mortality among adult patients registered for DR-TB treatment in the province.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients treated for laboratory confirmed DR-TB between January 2011 and December 2013. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were obtained from a web-based electronic database of patients treated for DR-TB. We applied modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors to identify risk factors for DR-TB mortality. We also stratified the analyses into multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant (XDR-TB).
Among 3,729 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 39% (n = 1,445) died. Of the patients that died, 53% (n = 766) were male, 68% (n = 982) had MDR-TB, 72% (n = 1,038) were HIV co-infected, and median age was 37 years (Interquartile Range [IQR] 30-46). Patients were at higher risk of mortality during DR-TB treatment if they were HIV co-infected not on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (adjusted incidence risk ratio [aIRR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9-3.8), were 60 years or older (aIRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5-2.0), had a diagnosis of XDR-TB (aIRR 1.6, 95%CI 1.5-1.7), or had been hospitalised at treatment start (aIRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5-1.8). Among MDR-TB patients, risk of mortality was higher if patients were HIV co-infected not on ART (aIRR 3.9, 95%CI 3.3-4.6), were 60 years or older (aIRR 1.9, 95%CI 1.6-2.3), or had been hospitalised at start of MDR-TB treatment (aIRR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5-1.9).

Probiotic administration may modify the gut microbiota; however, whether this modification could decrease VAP occurrence is not known.
In this study, 100 adult critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for >48 hours were randomly assigned to either the probiotic or the control group. The patients in the probiotic group received 2 capsules of probiotic preparation containing Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus spp., and those in the control group received placebo daily for 14 days.
The patients in the probiotic group had a lower incidence of statistically microbiologically confirmed VAP. The duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay was also lower in the probiotic group (P < .05). More than half of the patients in the control group had gastric residuals during ICU stay, compared with only 30% of patients in the probiotic group (P = .004). Probiotic usage led to a nonsignificant decrease in diarrhea, gastric and oropharyngeal colonization, and incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for time to the first episode of VAP did not show a significant difference between probiotic and control groups (log-rank test = 1.89; P = .17).

30071545,Updates in the Treatment of Active and Latent Tuberculosis.,,Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,"First-line therapy for active tuberculosis (TB) has remained unchanged for nearly 40 years. Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the initial two-month phase followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 to 7 months is standard treatment for people at low risk for drug-resistant disease. Directly-observed therapy (DOT) remains the standard of care for pulmonary TB. Virtual treatment monitoring using digital technologies is becoming more common as a way to provide a more patient-centered approach to care. Attempts to shorten treatment duration have been unsuccessful based on recent clinical trials evaluating the role of fluoroquinolones. Treatment-shortening trials using higher doses of rifamycins are currently underway. Recently approved medications for TB treatment are recommended only for drug-resistant disease, but novel agents in varying stages of development are being evaluated. Rifamycin-based regimens for latent TB infection (LTBI) have been successful in preventing progression to TB disease. Once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks by DOT was shown to be safe and effective compared with 9 months of isoniazid. The same regimen was shown to have acceptable treatment completion when given self-administered. Newer studies are investigating even shorter LTBI treatment with durations of less than 2 months. Treatment of LTBI in people likely infected with multidrug resistant TB is very limited, but one observational study found that fluoroquinolones appear to be effective.

The trial that has demonstrated efficacy of bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline that inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase, possesses the requisite features to conduct this evaluation. Approval of bedaquiline for use in MDR-TB was based primarily on the results of the controlled C208 Stage II study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00449644) including 160 patients randomized 1:1 to receive bedaquiline or placebo for 24 weeks when added to an 18-24-month preferred five-drug background regimen. Since randomization in C208 Stage II was preserved until study end, the trial results allow for the investigation of the complex relationship between sustained durable outcome with either Week 8 or Week 24 culture conversion as putative surrogate endpoints. The relationship between Week 120 outcome with Week 8 or Week 24 culture conversion was investigated using a descriptive analysis and with a recently developed statistical methodology for surrogate endpoint evaluation using methods of causal inference.

Little is known about the optimal treatment for these children.
To inform the pediatric aspects of the revised World Health Organization (WHO) MDR-TB treatment guidelines, we performed a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, describing treatment outcomes in children treated for MDR-TB. To identify eligible reports we searched PubMed, LILACS, Embase, The Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, and BioMedCentral databases through 1 October 2014. To identify unpublished data, we reviewed conference abstracts, contacted experts in the field, and requested data through other routes, including at national and international conferences and through organizations working in pediatric MDR-TB. A cohort was eligible for inclusion if it included a minimum of three children (aged <15 years) who were treated for bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR-TB, and if treatment outcomes were reported. The search yielded 2,772 reports; after review, 33 studies were eligible for inclusion, with IPD provided for 28 of these. All data were from published or unpublished observational cohorts. We analyzed demographic, clinical, and treatment factors as predictors of treatment outcome. In order to obtain adjusted estimates, we used a random-effects multivariable logistic regression (random intercept and random slope, unless specified otherwise) adjusted for the following covariates: age, sex, HIV infection, malnutrition, severe extrapulmonary disease, or the presence of severe disease on chest radiograph. We analyzed data from 975 children from 18 countries; 731 (75%) had bacteriologically confirmed and 244 (25%) had clinically diagnosed MDR-TB. The median age was 7.1 years. Of 910 (93%) children with documented HIV status, 359 (39%) were infected with HIV. When compared to clinically diagnosed patients, children with confirmed MDR-TB were more likely to be older, to be infected with HIV, to be malnourished, and to have severe tuberculosis (TB) on chest radiograph (p < 0.001 for all characteristics). Overall, 764 of 975 (78%) had a successful treatment outcome at the conclusion of therapy: 548/731 (75%) of confirmed and 216/244 (89%) of clinically diagnosed children (absolute difference 14%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8%-19%, p < 0.001). Treatment was successful in only 56% of children with bacteriologically confirmed TB who were infected with HIV who did not receive any antiretroviral treatment (ART) during MDR-TB therapy, compared to 82% in children infected with HIV who received ART during MDR-TB therapy (absolute difference 26%, 95% CI 5%-48%, p = 0.006). In children with confirmed MDR-TB, the use of second-line injectable agents and high-dose isoniazid (15-20 mg/kg/day) were associated with treatment success (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.9, 95% CI 1.0-8.3, p = 0.041 and aOR 5.9, 95% CI 1.7-20.5, p = 0.007, respectively). These findings for high-dose isoniazid may have been affected by site effect, as the majority of patients came from Cape Town. Limitations of this study include the difficulty of estimating the treatment effects of individual drugs within multidrug regimens, only observational cohort studies were available for inclusion, and treatment decisions were based on the clinician's perception of illness, with resulting potential for bias.
This study suggests that children respond favorably to MDR-TB treatment. The low success rate in children infected with HIV who did not receive ART during their MDR-TB treatment highlights the need for ART in these children. Our findings of individual drug effects on treatment outcome should be further evaluated.",,,,2018-07-12,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Lidocaine has been shown to be an effective anaesthetic diluent for some intramuscular injections, but has not been investigated with KM in the treatment of adult patients with MDR-TB.
We performed a randomised single-blinded crossover study to determine if lidocaine reduces KM injection-site pain. We recruited patients aged 18 years on MDR-TB treatment at two TB hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa. KM pharmacokinetic parameters and a validated numeric pain scale were used at intervals over 10 h following the injection of KM with and without lidocaine on two separate occasions.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of adherence interventions, including directly observed therapy (DOT), to determine which approaches lead to improved TB treatment outcomes.
We systematically reviewed Medline as well as the references of published review articles for relevant studies of adherence to multidrug treatment of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB through February 3, 2018. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as prospective and retrospective cohort studies (CSs) with an internal or external control group that evaluated any adherence intervention and conducted a meta-analysis of their impact on TB treatment outcomes. Our search identified 7,729 articles, of which 129 met the inclusion criteria for quantitative analysis. Seven adherence categories were identified, including DOT offered by different providers and at various locations, reminders and tracers, incentives and enablers, patient education, digital technologies (short message services [SMSs] via mobile phones and video-observed therapy [VOT]), staff education, and combinations of these interventions. When compared with DOT alone, self-administered therapy (SAT) was associated with lower rates of treatment success (CS: risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.89; RCT: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.98), adherence (CS: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.93), and sputum smear conversion (RCT: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) as well as higher rates of development of drug resistance (CS: RR 4.19, 95% CI 2.34-7.49). When compared to DOT provided by healthcare providers, DOT provided by family members was associated with a lower rate of adherence (CS: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.94).

Unfortunately, although there have been encouraging reports of higher success rates, the overall rate of favorable outcomes of M/XDR-TB treatment is only 54%, or much lower when the spectrum of drug resistance is beyond that of XDR-TB. Treating M/XDR-TB continues to be a difficult task, because of the high incidence of adverse events, the long duration of treatment, the high cost of the regimens used, and the drain on health care resources. Various trials and studies have recently been undertaken (some already published and others ongoing), all aimed at improving outcomes of M/XDR-TB treatment by changing the overall approach, shortening treatment duration, and developing a universal regimen. The objective of this review was to summarize what has been achieved to date, as far as new and repurposed drugs are concerned, with a special focus on delamanid, bedaquiline, pretomanid, clofazimine, carbapenems, and linezolid. After more than 40 years of neglect, greater attention has recently been paid to the need for new drugs to fight the ""white plague"", and promising results are being reported.
A tuberculose multirresistente (TB-MDR, do inglês multidrug-resistant) e a extensivamente resistente (TB-XDR, do inglês extensively drug-resistant) continuam representando um desafio para os clínicos e as autoridades de saúde pública.

We examined the pharmacokinetic interactions of bedaquiline plus either rifampin or rifabutin in 33 healthy volunteers. This sub-study of that trial examined the mycobactericidal activity of these drugs against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis using ex vivo whole blood culture.
Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two single 400 mg doses of bedaquiline, alone, and, after a 4 week washout period, in combination with steady-state daily dosing of either rifabutin 300 mg or rifampin 600 mg. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points subsequently, to measure plasma drug concentrations and bactericidal activity in ex vivo M tuberculosis-infected whole blood cultures (WBA).
Single oral doses of bedaquiline produced readily detectable WBA ex vivo, reaching a maximal effect of -0.28 log/day, with negative values indicating bacterial killing. Plasma concentrations of 355 ng/ml were sufficient for intracellular mycobacteriostasis. Combined dosing with rifampin or rifabutin produced maximal effects of -0.91 and -0.79 log/d, respectively. However, the activity of the rifabutin combination was sustained throughout the dosing interval, thereby producing a greater cumulative or total effect. At low drug concentrations, rifabutin plus bedaquiline yielded greater mycobactericidal activity than the sum of their separate effects. Neither drug metabolites nor cellular drug accumulation could account for this observation.

Community engagement is key to optimising the success of these trials. However, the clinical profile, epidemiology and social perceptions for paediatric multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) complicate the operationalisation of this community engagement. We reflect on a diversity of recent experiences attempting to implement this type of research and the community engagement around it. We describe four recommendations and argue that these should guide the implementation of the community engagement agenda in the new landscape of paediatric MDR-TB clinical trials. Specifically, we argue for 1) dynamic, long-term continuity in community engagement platforms; 2) tiers of TB and research literacy; 3) multiple separate and joint platforms for holding 'stakes'; and 4) addressing the social/structural implications of family participation. We conclude that community-level stakeholders, such as health workers, parents and children, are willing to collaborate in paediatric MDR-TB clinical trials. Using these recommendations, there is considerable opportunity for effective community engagement in this new era of paediatric MDR-TB research.",,,,2018-04-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
29665951,Statistical considerations for pediatric multidrug-resistant tuberculosis efficacy trials.,,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"The inclusion of newly licensed or repurposed drugs in regimens to treat children for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) may lead to treatment that is shorter than traditional regimens and composed only of oral medications. As an all-oral regimen may be more acceptable and have a better safety profile than current regimens, demonstrating non-inferiority may be satisfactory. Demonstrating non-inferior efficacy requires setting a non-inferiority margin and safeguarding study assay sensitivity. Multi-arm, multistage designs may currently not be appropriate in pediatric trials because of the lack of sensitive and specific intermediate outcomes. However, including an arm with an agent to ameliorate toxicity would be efficient. Covariates can be used to stratify randomization, define subgroups, and improve efficiency of analysis. Enriching the sample for the confirmed-TB subgroup to ensure that they are well represented may be important. Primary outcomes using a fixed timepoint from randomization for all study arms will result in variations in post-treatment duration, but may be the best choice. While blinding of site personnel and patients may not be possible when regimens differ substantially in drugs and modes of administration, blinding should be maintained for independent endpoint review groups and other personnel. Type I error and family-wise error rates should be tightly controlled.",,,,2018-04-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
29665950,Conducting efficacy trials in children with MDR-TB: what is the rationale and how should they be done?,,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"Paediatric anti-tuberculosis treatment trials have traditionally been limited to Phase I/II studies evaluating the drug pharmacokinetics and safety in children, with assumptions about efficacy made by extrapolating data from adults. However, it is increasingly being recognised that, in some circumstances, efficacy trials are required in children. The current treatment for children with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is long and toxic; shorter, safer regimens, using novel agents, require urgent evaluation. Given the changing pattern of drug metabolism, disease spectrum and rates of TB disease confirmation with age, decisions around inclusion criteria require careful consideration. The most straightforward MDR-TB efficacy trial would include only children with confirmed MDR-TB and no additional drug resistance. Given that it may be unclear at the time treatment is initiated whether the diagnosis will ultimately be confirmed and what the final drug resistance profile will be, this presents a unique challenge in children. Recruiting only these children would, however, limit the generalisability of such a trial, as in reality the majority of children with TB do not have bacteriologically confirmed disease. Given the good existing treatment outcomes with current routine regimens for children with MDR-TB, conducting a superiority trial may not be the optimal design. Demonstrating non-inferiority of efficacy, but superiority with regard to safety, would be an alternative strategy. Using standardised control and experimental MDR-TB treatment regimens is challenging given the wide spectrum of paediatric disease. However, using variable regimens would make interpretation challenging. A paediatric MDR-TB efficacy trial is urgently needed, and with global collaboration and capacity building, is highly feasible.",,,,2018-04-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The global burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has recently increased by an annual rate of more than 20%. According to the World Health Organization approximately only half of all patients treated for MDR-TB achieved a successful outcome. For many years, patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) have received standardized treatment regimens, thereby accelerating the development of MDR-TB through drug-specific resistance amplification. Comprehensive drug susceptibility testing (phenotypic and/or genotypic) is necessary to inform physicians about the best drugs to treat individual patients with tailor-made treatment regimens. Phenotypic drug resistance can now often, but with variable sensitivity, be predicted by molecular drug susceptibility testing based on whole genome sequencing, which in the future could become an affordable method for the guidance of treatment decisions, especially in high-burden/resource-limited settings. More recently, MDR-TB treatment outcomes have dramatically improved with the use of bedaquiline-based regimens. Ongoing clinical trials with novel and repurposed drugs will potentially further improve cure-rates, and may substantially decrease the duration of MDR-TB treatment necessary to achieve relapse-free cure.",,,,2018-04-12,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

This was a cross-sectional survey of mycobacterial isolates from previously treated patients referred to the Chest Clinic Laboratory between October 2010 and October 2013. The Bactec MGIT 960 system for mycobactrerial culture and drug sensitivity testing (DST) was used for sputum culture of AFB smear-positive patients with relapse, treatment failure, failure of smear conversion, or default.

The aim of the study was to compare success, mortality, and acquired rifampicin resistance in patients with INH-R pulmonary tuberculosis given different durations of rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (REZ); a fluoroquinolone plus 6 months or more of REZ; and streptomycin plus a core regimen of REZ.
Studies with regimens and outcomes known for individual patients with INH-R tuberculosis were eligible, irrespective of the number of patients if randomised trials, or with at least 20 participants if a cohort study. Studies were identified from two relevant systematic reviews, an updated search of one of the systematic reviews (for papers published between April 1, 2015, and Feb 10, 2016), and personal communications. Individual patient data were obtained from authors of eligible studies. The individual patient data meta-analysis was performed with propensity score matched logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and risk differences of treatment success (cure or treatment completion), death during treatment, and acquired rifampicin resistance. Outcomes were measured across different treatment regimens to assess the effects of: different durations of REZ (≤6 months vs >6 months); addition of a fluoroquinolone to REZ (fluoroquinolone plus 6 months or more of REZ vs 6 months or more of REZ); and addition of streptomycin to REZ (streptomycin plus 6 months of rifampicin and ethambutol and 1-3 months of pyrazinamide vs 6 months or more of REZ). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methodology.
Individual patient data were requested for 57 cohort studies and 17 randomised trials including 8089 patients with INH-R tuberculosis. We received 33 datasets with 6424 patients, of which 3923 patients in 23 studies received regimens related to the study objectives. Compared with a daily regimen of 6 months of (H)REZ (REZ with or without isoniazid), extending the duration to 8-9 months had similar outcomes; as such, 6 months or more of (H)REZ was used for subsequent comparisons. Addition of a fluoroquinolone to 6 months or more of (H)REZ was associated with significantly greater treatment success (aOR 2·8, 95% CI 1·1-7·3), but no significant effect on mortality (aOR 0·7, 0·4-1·1) or acquired rifampicin resistance (aOR 0·1, 0·0-1·2). Compared with 6 months or more of (H)REZ, the standardised retreatment regimen (2 months of streptomycin, 3 months of pyrazinamide, and 8 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) was associated with significantly worse treatment success (aOR 0·4, 0·2-0·7). The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes and treatment regimens assessed, owing to the observational nature of most of the data, the diverse settings, and the imprecision of estimates.
In patients with INH-R tuberculosis, compared with treatment with at least 6 months of daily REZ, addition of a fluoroquinolone was associated with better treatment success, whereas addition of streptomycin was associated with less treatment success; however, the quality of the evidence was very low. These results support the conduct of randomised trials to identify the optimum regimen for this important and common form of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

To compare the efficacy and safety of daily, part-daily, and intermittent antituberculosis therapy regimens in the treatment of HIV-associated pulmonary TB.
This open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, south India. Adults infected with HIV with newly diagnosed, culture-positive, pulmonary TB were enrolled between September 14, 2009, and January 18, 2016.
Patients were randomized to daily, part-daily, and intermittent antituberculosis therapy regimens, stratified by baseline CD4 lymphocyte count and sputum smear grade. Antiretroviral therapy was initiated as per national guidelines. Clinical and sputum microbiological examinations of patients were performed monthly until 18 months after randomization. Adverse events were recorded using standard criteria.
The primary outcome was favorable response, defined as treatment completion with all available sputum cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis during the last 2 months of treatment. Unfavorable responses included treatment failures, dropouts, deaths, and toxic effects among regimens.
Of 331 patients (251 [76%] male; mean [SD] age, 39 [9] years; mean [SD] HIV viral load, 4.9 [1.2] log10 copies/mL; and median [interquartile range] CD4 lymphocyte count, 138 [69-248] cells/μL), favorable responses were experienced by 91% (89 of 98), 80% (77 of 96), and 77% (75 of 98) in the daily, part-daily, and intermittent regimens, respectively.

In low TB burden countries, the underlying causes and consequences of recurrent TB are poorly understood. We conducted a literature review to summarise the evidence of recurrent TB in low-burden settings and to address current gaps in knowledge. We included peer-reviewed publications on studies conducted in countries with an estimated TB incidence of <100 cases per 100 000 population. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess study quality. The review yielded 44 manuscripts, 39 of which were reports of observational studies and 5 of clinical trials. The median percentage of TB patients experiencing an episode of recurrent TB after treatment completion was 3.4% (interquartile range [IQR] 1.6-6.0, range 0.4-16.7) in studies with a median follow-up of 7.8 years (IQR 5-12, range 2-33). The median percentage of recurrences attributable to endogenous reactivation (rather than exogenous reinfection) was 81% (IQR 73.1-85.5, range 49-100). Commonly identified risk factors for recurrence in low-burden settings included infection by the human immunodeficiency virus, low socio-economic status, foreign birth and infection with drug-resistant TB. Current understanding of recurrence in low-burden settings is limited, in part due to substantial methodological differences between studies. Further research is required to delineate the mechanisms of TB recurrence, its health and clinical impact, as well as the implications for TB elimination efforts in low-burden countries.",,,,2018-03-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Infectious diseases,"Bedaquiline and delamanid have been approved for treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the past 5 years. Because of theoretical safety concerns, patients have been unable to access the two drugs in combination. Médecins Sans Frontières has supported the use of combination bedaquiline and delamanid for people with few treatment options since 2016. We describe early safety and efficacy of regimens containing the bedaquiline and delamanid combination in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Yerevan, Armenia; Mumbai, India; and Khayelitsha, South Africa.
We retrospectively analysed a cohort of all patients who received 6-12 months of oral bedaquiline and delamanid in combination (400 mg bedaquiline once per day for 2 weeks, then 200 mg bedaquiline three times per week and 100 mg delamanid twice per day) in MSF-supported projects. We report serious adverse events, QTc corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) interval data, and culture conversion data during the first 6 months of treatment.
Between Jan 1, 2016, and Aug 31, 2016, 28 patients (median age 32·5 years [IQR 28·5-40·5], 17 men) were included in the analysis. 11 (39%) of 28 patients were HIV-positive. 24 patients (86%) had isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones; 14 patients (50%) had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. No patient had an increase of more than 500 ms in their QTcF interval. Four patients (14%) had six instances of QTcF increase of more than 60 ms from baseline but none permanently discontinued the drugs. 16 serious adverse events were reported in seven patients. Of 23 individuals with positive baseline cultures, 17 (74%) converted to negative by month 6 of treatment.
Use of the bedaquiline and delamanid combination appears to reveal no additive or synergistic QTcF-prolonging effects. Access to bedaquiline and delamanid in combination should be expanded for people with few treatment options while awaiting the results of formal clinical trials.

Blood samples were drawn from 174 patients with MDR/RR-TB and 838 patients with drug-susceptible PTB in ethnic Han population from Hubei province (central China). Four-digit allele genotyping of HLA- A, B and DRB1 loci was performed using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR- SSOP). The allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A, B and DRB1 were determined and compared between patients with MDR/RR-TB and patients with drug-susceptible PTB. Statistical analysis of the generated data indicated no departure from expectation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at all loci of the control group. Multivariate analysis identified allele DRB1*08:01 (p < .0001; OR = 174.5, 95% CI 15.3-1987.2) as independent predictor of MDR/RR-TB, except for old age (p < .0001; OR = 10. 9, 95% CI 7.6-15.8), previous treatment history (p < .0001; OR = 11.0, 95% CI 7.2-16.7) and poor compliance to treatment (p < .0001; OR = 12.9, 95% CI 8.4-20.0).

29218501,"Evaluating Safety Reporting in Paediatric Antibiotic Trials, 2000-2016: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",,Drugs,"There are very few options to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in children. A major barrier is the duration and complexity of regulatory trials of new antibiotics. Extrapolation of safety data from adult trials could facilitate drug development for children.
We performed a systematic review on the safety of antibiotic clinical trials (CTs) in children (0-18 years) to evaluate the overall quality of safety trials conducted in children and to determine if age-specific adverse events (AEs) could be identified for specific antibiotic classes.
We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases for trials conducted between 2000 and 2016.
All trials in which safety was declared a primary or secondary endpoint were included. Exclusion criteria were (1) topical or inhalational route of administration; (2) non-infectious conditions; (3) administration for prophylaxis rather than treatment; (4) selected population (i.e. cystic fibrosis, malignancies, HIV and tuberculosis); and (5) design other than randomized controlled trials. Trials reporting data on both adults and children were included only if paediatric results were reported separately.
Two authors independently extracted the data. To assess the quality of published trials, the Extension for harms for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement 2004 was used.
In order to quantitatively assess the rate of developing AEs by drug class, the numbers of overall and body-system-specific AEs were collected for each study arm, and then calculated per single drug class as median and interquartile range (IQR) of the proportions across CTs. The AEs most frequently reported were compared in the meta-analysis by selecting the CTs on the most represented drug classes.
Eighty-three CTs were included, accounting for 27,693 children. Overall, 69.7% of CONSORT items were fully reported. The median proportion of children with any AE was 22.5%, but did not exceed 8% in any single body system. Serious drug-related AEs and drug-related discontinuations were very rare (median 0.3 and 0.9%, respectively). Limitations included the inability to stratify by age group, particularly neonates.
Overall, AEs in paediatric antibiotic CTs were predictable and class-specific, and no unexpected (age-specific) side effects were identified. Smaller, open-label, dose-finding, high-quality, single-arm pharmacokinetic trials seem potentially sufficient for certain common antibiotic classes, extrapolating well-established safety profiles determined from large adult efficacy trials. This approach could reduce duration and enhance subsequent registration of urgently needed new antibiotics. This will need to be combined with enhanced methods of pharmacovigilance for monitoring of emerging AEs in routine clinical practice.",,"Eighty-three CTs were included, accounting for 27,693 children.

29194073,Update on trends in childhood tuberculosis.,,Current opinion in pediatrics,"Although tuberculosis (TB) causes much morbidity and mortality in children, diagnosis and treatment remain challenging. Recently, children have gained increasing attention in research and clinical trials driving improved contact management, case identification and treatment of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB. This review highlights some recent advances.
The tuberculin skin test is the most widely used test to distinguish Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection from active TB, however, using M. tuberculosis-specific, antigenic stimulation of CD4 and CD8 cells appear more effective. The use of Xpert MTB/RIF to identify M. tuberculosis in clinical samples, together with novel sampling methods have in part, overcome the difficulty of sampling and increased case identification capacity. Advances in treating both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant childhood TB show promise in being more paediatric friendly and improving adherence. Dosing strategies for drug-sensitive TB have improved with dispersible fixed drug combinations now available. In the treatment and prevention of drug-resistant TB, however, research involving the use of newer and more effective drugs currently recommended for adults, are still ongoing in children.
The World Health Organization aims to end the TB epidemic by 2035 whereas the United Nations' Sustainable Developmental Goals sets this ambitious target for 2030.

Fluoroquinolones remain an essential part of MDR-TB treatment, but the optimal dose of fluoroquinolones as part of the regimen has not been defined.
We designed a randomized, blinded, phase II trial in MDR-TB patients comparing across levofloxacin doses of 11, 14, 17 and 20 mg/kg/day, all within an optimized background regimen. We assess pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and tolerability of regimens containing each of these doses. The primary efficacy outcome is time to culture conversion over the first 6 months of treatment. The study aims to determine the area under the curve (AUC) of the levofloxacin serum concentration in the 24 hours after dosing divided by the minimal inhibitory concentration of the patient's Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate that inhibits > 90% of organisms (AUC/MIC) that maximizes efficacy and the AUC that maximizes safety and tolerability in the context of an MDR-TB treatment regimen.
Fluoroquinolones are an integral part of recommended MDR-TB regimens. Little is known about how to optimize dosing for efficacy while maintaining acceptable toxicity. This study will provide evidence to support revised dosing guidelines for the use of levofloxacin as part of combination regimens for treatment of MDR-TB. The novel methodology can be adapted to elucidate the effect of other single agents in multidrug antibiotic treatment regimens.

The threat is even more severe in the developing countries where there is a lack of advanced medical amenities and contemporary anti-TB drugs. In such situations, dosage optimization of existing medication regimens seems to be the only viable option. Therapeutic drug monitoring study results suggest that high-dose treatment regimens can compensate the low serum concentration of anti-TB drugs and shorten the therapy duration. The article presents a critical review on the possible changes that occur in the host and the pathogen upon the administration of standard and high-dose regimens. Some of the most common factors that are responsible for low anti-TB drug concentrations in the serum are differences in hosts' body weight, metabolic processing of the drug, malabsorption and/or drug-drug interaction. Furthermore, failure to reach the cavitary pulmonary and extrapulmonary tissues also contributes to the therapeutic inefficiency of the drugs. In such conditions, administration of higher doses can help in compensating the pathogenic outcomes of enhancement of the pathogen's physical barriers, efflux pumps and genetic mutations. The present article also presents a summary of the recorded treatment outcomes of clinical trials that were conducted to test the efficacy of administration of high dose of anti-tuberculosis drugs.

To investigate whether an exposure-response relationship could be characterized by making better use of the existing information on pharmacokinetics and longitudinal measurements of mycobacterial load.
Quantitative culture data in the form of time to positivity (TTP) in mycobacterial growth indicator tubes obtained from a randomized placebo-controlled Phase IIb registration trial were examined using non-linear mixed-effects methodology. The link to individual bedaquiline exposures and other patient characteristics was evaluated.
The developed model included three simultaneously fitted components: a longitudinal representation of mycobacterial load in patients, a probabilistic component for bacterial presence in sputum samples, and a time-to-event model for TTP. Data were described adequately, and time to SCC was well predicted. Individual bedaquiline exposure was found to significantly affect the decline in mycobacterial load. Consequently, the proportion of patients without SCC at week 20 is expected to decrease from 25% (95% CI 20%-31%) without bedaquiline to 17% (95% CI 13%-21%), 12% (95% CI 8%-16%) and 7% (95% CI 4%-11%), respectively, with half the median, median and double the median bedaquiline exposure observed in patients with standard dosing. Baseline bacterial load and level of drug resistance were other important predictors.

28946683,Usability of a Medication Event Reminder Monitor System (MERM) by Providers and Patients to Improve Adherence in the Management of Tuberculosis.,"adherence, management, monitoring technology, tuberculosis, usability",International journal of environmental research and public health,"Poor initiation and implementation and premature discontinuation of anti-tuberculous therapy, all forms of nonadherence, are major reasons for treatment failure, the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and transmission to other non-infected individuals. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) has been the worldwide standard, but implementation of DOT is burdensome for providers and patients, especially in resource-limited settings, where most of the burden of active TB is located. Among the alternatives to DOT is electronic monitoring (EM) of drug dosing histories. Here we report a usability study of a newly-designed, modular electronic monitor product, called the MERM (Medication Event and Reminder Monitor), that is compatible with TB medication formats and supply chains in resource-limited settings. This study, done in a rural setting in China, showed that the use of the MERM for EM of TB medications was associated with a high degree of user performance, acceptability, and satisfaction among both TB patients and medical staff. Based on these data, EM is becoming the standard of care for drug-susceptible TB patients in China and scaled implementations in several other countries with high TB burden have begun. In addition, the MERM is being used in MDR-TB patients and in clinical trials involving patients with TB/HIV and latent TB.",,,,2017-09-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

HIV-TB coinfection and rapid increase in the emergence of drug resistant forms of TB is a dangerous scenario. This underlines the urgent need for new drugs with novel mechanism of action. A plethora of literature exist that highlight the importance of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mycobacterial cell wall responsible for its survival, growth, permeability, virulence and resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, assembly of cell wall components is an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of this review is to highlight novel sets of enzyme inhibitors that disrupt its cell wall biosynthetic pathway.

MTB is the pathogen which is responsible for causing the infectious disease tuberculosis; it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in poor low-income countries as well as in developing countries because of non-availability of reliable laboratory facilities. The current treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is lengthy, complex, and connected with severe harmful side effects and poor outcomes. The present cure against tuberculosis has substantial restrictions, in terms of their efficiency, side-effect outline, and complication of handling. Furthermore, the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreaks during the 1990s and additionally in recent times the vast deadly strains of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and totally drug resistance tuberculosis (TDR-TB) is hampering efforts to control and manage tuberculosis (TB). As a result, novel methodologies for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) are severely desired. A number of new potential anti-tuberculosis drug candidates with novel modes of action have been entered in clinical trials in recent years. These agents are most likely to be effective against resistant strains. The treatment landscape is beginning to shift, with the recent approvals by Food and Drug Administration to the new TB drugs bedaquiline and delamanid. Also, the pipeline of potential new treatments has been fulfilled with several compounds in clinical trials or preclinical development with promising activities against sensitive and resistant MTB bacteria. An additional new chemical entity is also under development. The already existing drugs with their suggested mode of treatment as well as new probable anti-tuberculosis drug moieties which are at present in the pipeline has been summarized in this review.",,,,2017-09-25,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Development of a new chemical entity from hit to marketed drug is an extremely time and resources consuming process with uncertain outcome. Repurposing of clinically used drugs can be a cheaper alternative to develop new drugs effective in the treatment of tuberculosis.
To extract the latest information on new mechanisms of action described or proposed for clinically used antitubercular drugs. To identify drugs from various pharmacodynamic groups as candidates for repurposing to become effective in combatting tuberculosis. Attention will be paid to elucidate the connection between repurposed drugs and new antituberculars in clinical practice or in clinical trials.

Approximately one half of tuberculous meningitis patients die or suffer severe neurologic disability. The goal of this review will be to review the pathogenic, clinical, and radiologic features of tuberculous meningitis and to highlight recent advancements in translational and clinical science.
Pharmacologic therapy includes combination anti-tuberculosis drug regimens and adjunctive corticosteroids. It is becoming clear that a successful treatment outcome depends on an immune response that is neither too weak nor overly robust, and genetic determinants of this immune response may identify which patients will benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids. Recent clinical trials of intensified anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens conducted in Indonesia and Vietnam, motivated by the pharmacologic challenges of treating M. tuberculosis infections of the central nervous system, have yielded conflicting results regarding the survival benefit of intensified treatment regimens. More consistent findings have been observed regarding the relationship between initial anti-tuberculosis drug resistance and mortality among tuberculous meningitis patients.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the regulation of inflammation, the relation between plasma miRNA and pulmonary tuberculosis with cavity remains unknown. In this study, plasma samples were derived from 89 cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (CP-TB) patients, 89 non-cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (NCP-TB) patients and 95 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age and gender. In the screening phase, Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze miRNA profiles in plasma samples pooled from CP-TB patients, NCP-TB patients and healthy controls. During the training and verification phases, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to verify the differential expression of selected miRNAs among groups. Illumina high-throughput sequencing identified 29 differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in TB patients when compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis validated miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as miRNAs that were differently present between TB patients and healthy controls. ROC curve analysis revealed that the potential of these 3 miRNAs to distinguish TB patients from healthy controls was high, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranged from 0.692 to 0.970. Moreover, miR-320a levels were decreased in drug-resistant TB patients than pan-susceptible TB patients (AUC = 0.882). In conclusion, we identified miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as potential blood-based biomarkers for TB.

Because of its low toxicity, broad-spectrum activity, and good bioavailability, rifampin is now commonly administered as combination antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of various infections caused by organisms other than mycobacteria. This review summarizes the most recent clinical studies on the use of rifampin combinations for treating four common non-mycobacterial infections: acute bacterial meningitis, infective endocarditis and bacteraemia, pneumonia, and biofilm-related infections.

To summarise the effects of TB preventive treatment versus placebo in HIV-positive children with no known TB contact on active TB, death, and reported adverse events.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and two trial registers up to February 2017.
We included trials of HIV-positive children with and without known TB exposure, randomized to receive TB preventive treatment or placebo.
Two review authors independently used the study selection criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed effects using risk, incidence rate and hazard ratios and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.
We included three trials, involving 991 participants, below the age of 13 years, from South Africa and Botswana. Children were randomized to isoniazid prophylaxis or placebo, given daily or three times weekly. The median length of follow-up ranged from 5.7 to 34 months; some were on antiretroviral therapy (ART).In HIV-positive children not on ART, isoniazid prophylaxis may reduce the risk of active TB (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.87; 1 trial, 240 participants, low certainty evidence), and death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.95; 1 trial, 240 participants, low certainty evidence). One trial (182 participants) reported number of children with laboratory adverse events, which was similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups. No clinical adverse events were reported.In HIV-positive children on ART, we do not know if isoniazid prophylaxis reduces the risk of active TB (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 3 trials, 737 participants, very low certainty evidence) or death (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.72; 3 trials, 737 participants, very low certainty evidence). Two trials (714 participants) reported number of clinical adverse events and three trials (795 participants) reported number of laboratory adverse events; for both categories, the number of adverse events were similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups.

Areas covered: This review covers epidemiology, treatment regimen and duration, newer drugs and adverse events in children with MDR-TB. Special note has been made of epidemiology and principles of treatment followed in Indian children. Expert opinion: High index of suspicion is essential for diagnosing childhood MDR-TB. If there is high probability, a child can be diagnosed as presumptive MDR-TB and started on empiric treatment in consultation with experts. However, every effort should be made to confirm the diagnosis. Backbone of an effective MDR-TB regimen consists of four 2nd line anti-TB drugs plus pyrazinamide; duration being 18-24 months. The newer drugs delamanid and bedaquiline can be used in younger children if no other alternatives are available after consultation with experts.

The primary outcome was treatment success. When possible, we also evaluated, death, loss to follow-up, treatment adherence and health-system costs. To obtain pooled relative risk (RR) estimates, we performed random-effects meta-analyses.
Eight studies met the eligibility criteria for review inclusion. Six cohort studies, with 4026 participants in total, reported on treatment outcomes. The pooled RR estimate for decentralized versus centralized care for treatment success was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.01-1.27). The corresponding estimate for loss to follow-up was RR: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.38-1.13), for death RR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.67-1.52) and for treatment failure was RR: 1.07 (95% CI: 0.48-2.40). Two of three studies evaluating health-care costs reported lower costs for the decentralized models of care than for the centralized models.
Treatment success was more likely among patients with MDR tuberculosis treated using a decentralized approach. Further studies are required to explore the effectiveness of decentralized MDR tuberculosis care in a range of different settings.

Провести оценку эффективности децентрализованной формы оказания медицинской помощи пациентам с туберкулезом со множественной лекарственной устойчивостью (МЛУ) по сравнению с централизованными подходами.
Мы провели поиск в ClinicalTrials.gov, Кокрановской библиотеке, Embase®, Google Scholar, LILACS, PubMed®, Web of Science и на портале клинических испытаний Всемирной организации здравоохранения на предмет исследований, в которых сообщается о результатах лечения туберкулеза с МЛУ при децентрализованной и централизованной форме оказания медицинской помощи. Основным результатом была эффективность лечения. По возможности мы также проводили оценку летальности, популяции пациентов, выбывших из последующего наблюдения, следования предписанному режиму и затрат в системе здравоохранения. Чтобы получить объединенные оценки отношения рисков (ОР), мы провели метаанализы с использованием модели случайных эффектов.
Восемь исследований соответствовали критериям приемлемости для включения в обзор. В шести когортных исследованиях, в которых участвовало 4026 человек, сообщалось о результатах лечения. Объединенная оценка ОР для эффективности лечения при децентрализованной и централизованной формах лечения составила 1,13 (95%-й ДИ: 1,01–1,27). Соответствующими оценками ОР для пациентов, выбывших из последующего наблюдения, были: 0,66 (95%-й ДИ: 0,38–1,13), ОР для летальности: 1,01 (95%-й ДИ: 0,67–1,52), ОР для безуспешного лечения: 1,07 (95%-й ДИ: 0,48–2,40). В двух из трех исследований, в которых проводилась оценка затрат в системе здравоохранения, сообщалось о более низких затратах при децентрализованной форме оказания медицинской помощи по сравнению с централизованной моделью.
Эффективность лечения была более вероятной среди пациентов с МЛУ-туберкулезом, получавших медицинскую помощь с использованием децентрализованного подхода.

To evaluate the effect of a POC diagnostic strategy on initiation of appropriate TB treatment.
We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of adults with cough who were HIV positive and/or at high risk of drug-resistant TB. Two-week time blocks were randomized to two strategies: (1) Xpert MTB/RIF test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) performed at a district hospital laboratory or (2) POC Xpert MTB/RIF test performed at a primary health care clinic. All participants provided two sputum specimens: one for the Xpert test and the other for culture as a reference standard. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) initiated on appropriate TB treatment within 30 days.
Between August 22, 2011, and March 1, 2013, 36 two-week blocks were randomized, and 1,297 individuals were enrolled (646 in the laboratory arm, 651 in the POC arm), 159 (12.4%) of whom had culture-positive PTB. The proportions of participants with culture-positive PTB initiated on appropriate TB treatment within 30 days were 76.5% in the laboratory arm and 79.5% in the POC arm (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-2.53; P = 0.76; risk difference, 3.1%; 95% confidence interval, -16.2 to 10.1). The median time to initiation of appropriate treatment was 7 days (laboratory) versus 1 day (POC).
POC positioning of the Xpert test led to more rapid initiation of appropriate TB treatment. Achieving one-stop diagnosis and treatment for all people with TB will require simpler, more sensitive diagnostics and broader strengthening of health systems.

Cell wall of bacteria belonging to this genus is unique in many ways. It plays a major role in the pathogenesis and intracellular survival inside the host. In intracellular pathogens, their cell wall acts as molecular shield and interacts with host cell milieu to modulate host defense responses.
In this review, we summarize the factors that participate in the biosynthesis of unique mycobacterial cell wall, understand their potential as drug targets and the recent developments where they have been evaluated as possible drug targets.
Several cell wall associated factors that play crucial roles in the synthesis of cell wall components like Antigen 85 complex, Glycosyltransferases (GTs), LM (lipomannan) and LAM (lipoarabinomannan), mAGP Complex, lipolytic enzyme have been categorically documented. Most of the presently used anti TB regimens interrupted cell wall synthesis, but the emergence of drug resistant strains made it mandatory to identify new drug targets. Novel drug candidates which could inhibit the synthesis of cell wall components have been thoroughly studied worldwide.

Tuberculosis treatment consists in an intensive phase and a continuation phase. Unfortunately, the appearance of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis, mainly due to low adherence to prescribed therapies or inefficient healthcare structures, requires at least 20months of treatment with second-line, more toxic and less efficient drugs, i.e., capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin and fluoroquinolones. Therefore, there exists an urgent need for discovery and development of new drugs to reduce the global burden of this disease, including the multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. To this end, many plant species, as well as marine organisms and fungi have been and continue to be used in various traditional healing systems around the world to treat tuberculosis, thus representing a nearly unlimited source of active ingredients. Besides their antimycobacterial activity, natural products can be useful in adjuvant therapy to improve the efficacy of conventional antimycobacterial therapies, to decrease their adverse effects and to reverse mycobacterial multi-drug resistance due to the genetic plasticity and environmental adaptability of Mycobacterium. However, even if some natural products have still been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies, the validation of their efficacy and safety as antituberculosis agents is far from being reached, and, therefore, according to an evidence-based approach, more high-level randomized clinical trials are urgently needed.",,,,2017-07-12,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We hypothesized that the rapid increase in smartphone users and advances in digital technology would render bracelet-based applications possible; specifically, that bracelet- and self-directed observational therapy (BSDOT) can be used by patients with TB to ensure adherence to TB medication regimens and by basic village physicians to monitor care. This will ultimately allow TB to be controlled in low-resource environments.
This study will have three phases: development of a bracelet capable of storing pills and recording adherence to medication regimens; creation of a BSDOT smartphone application capable of supporting reminders to patients and health care interactions between patients and village physicians; and performance of a cluster randomized controlled trial in Hunan Province, China. Patients in the intervention group will receive free bracelets and smartphones, and their daily medication intake will be directed by the smartphones; the control group will receive no intervention. The primary outcome will be the TB treatment result as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as follows: Cured, Treatment completed, Treatment failed, Died, Lost to follow-up, Not evaluated, or Treatment success. The secondary outcome will be treatment adherence, defined as the percentage of patients receiving TB treatment who missed fewer than 5% of doses. We will also assess self-reported adherence using the Morisky, Green, and Levine Adherence Scale (MGLS) and evaluate respondents' knowledge about TB and quality of life. A regression model will be used to explore whether the interventions improve drug adherence and other outcome measures. DISCUSSION﻿: This will be a powerful means by which to strengthen TB control and prevent TB, especially multidrug-resistant epidemics of the disease. In addition, our novel smartphone-based tool can be readily adopted for use in low-resource remote environments with limited health care facilities and few economic assets.

Meta-analysis results are mixed and few studies have examined this relationship prospectively.
As part of a comparative diagnostic study, we conducted a prospective cohort study with 834 Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected patients from selected hospitals and clinics with high prevalence of drug-resistant TB in India, Moldova, and South Africa. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the association between later-generation fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) use and patient mortality, adjusting for risk factors typically associated with poor treatment outcomes.
After adjusting for phenotypic resistance profile, low body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2), human immunodeficiency virus status, and study site, participants treated with a later-generation fluoroquinolone had half the risk of mortality compared with participants either not treated with any fluoroquinolone or treated only with an earlier-generation fluoroquinolone (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% confidence interval, .26-.80]) during follow-up.
Use of later-generation fluoroquinolones significantly reduced patient mortality risk in our cohort, suggesting that removal of a later-generation fluoroquinolone from a treatment regimen because of demonstrated resistance to an earlier-generation fluoroquinolone might increase mortality risk.

The primary endpoint of the trial was 9-month survival. In this subgroup analysis, resistance categories were predefined as multidrug resistant (MDR), isoniazid resistant, rifampicin susceptible (INH-R), and susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid (INH-S + RIF-S). Outcome by resistance categories and response to intensified treatment were compared and estimated by Cox regression.
Of 817 randomized patients, 322 had a known drug resistance profile. INH-R was found in 86 (26.7%) patients, MDR in 15 (4.7%) patients, rifampicin monoresistance in 1 patient (0.3%), and INH-S + RIF-S in 220 (68.3%) patients. Multivariable regression showed that MDR (hazard ratio [HR], 5.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.00-11.6]), P < .001), was an independent predictor of death. INH-R had a significant association with the combined outcome of new neurological events or death (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.11-2.23]). Adjusted Cox regression, corrected for treatment adjustments, showed that intensified treatment was significantly associated with improved survival (HR, 0.34 [95% CI, .15-.76], P = .01) in INH-R TBM.

Tuberculosis (TB) strains resistant to rifampicin and other TB medicines challenge patient survival and public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has published treatment guidelines for drug-resistant TB since 1997 and last updated them in 2016 based on reviews of aggregated and individual patient data from published and unpublished studies. An international expert panel formulated recommendations following the GRADE approach. The new WHO guidelines recommend a standardised 9-12 months shorter treatment regimen as first choice in patients with multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) strains not resistant to fluoroquinolones or second-line injectable agents; resistance to these two classes of core second-line medicines is rapidly detectable with molecular diagnostics also approved by WHO in 2016. The composition of longer regimens for patients ineligible for the shorter regimen was modified. A first-ever meta-analysis of individual paediatric patient data allowed treatment recommendations for childhood MDR/RR-TB to be made. Delamanid is now also recommended in patients aged 6-17 years.

In recent years, promising new treatment options have emerged as add-on therapies to a BR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term costs and effectiveness of adding the novel or group 5 interventions bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), within their marketing authorisations, from a German healthcare cost-effectiveness perspective.
A cohort-based Markov model was developed to simulate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR, delamanid plus BR, or linezolid plus BR versus BR alone in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and Life-Years Gained (LYG), using inputs from clinical trials for bedaquiline and delamanid and from a German observational study for linezolid. Cost data were obtained from German Drug Directory costs (€/2015), published literature, and expert opinion. A 3% yearly discount rate was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
The total discounted costs per-patient were €85,575 for bedaquiline plus BR, €81,079 for delamanid plus BR, and €80,460 for linezolid plus BR, compared with a cost of €60,962 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per-patient were 5.95 for bedaquiline plus BR, 5.36 for delamanid plus BR, and 3.91 for linezolid plus BR, compared with 3.68 for BR alone. All interventions were therefore associated with higher QALYs and higher costs than BR alone, with incremental costs per QALY gained of €22,238 for bedaquiline, €38,703 for delamanid, and €87,484 for linezolid, versus BR alone. In a fully incremental analysis, bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment option at thresholds greater than €22,000 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, the probability that bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 was 54.5%, compared with 22.9% for BR alone, 18.2% for delamanid plus BR, and 4.4% for linezolid.

Even though tuberculosis appears to be decreasing in incidence globally for some time, the proportion of drug resistance is increasing, contributing to greater complexity, morbidity and mortality as well as cost. Since the advent of rifampicin in the 1960s, and the implementation of standard quadruple anti-tuberculosis regimen in the late 1970s, no new drugs have been changed the first line regimen. This regimen is effective however it is pill burden, and duration has not received investment and innovation. Drug-resistant regimens are long and frequently poorly tolerated due to significant toxicity. This review is an update on what is new in the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis, new TB drugs currently being used and studied in clinical trials are also mentioned. Fortunately, there have been many significant advances in this field in recent years. The horizon is changing with the new WHO shorter multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimens and with the increasing availability of new or repurposed drugs like bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine and linezolid. These drugs pose new challenges relating to their rational use to prevent selection of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis even before a new regimen has been studied. The availability of these new drugs is offering hope and new possibilities for saving patients who had few or no treatment options.

Optimizing its usage to maximize efficacy while minimizing its toxicity requires greater understanding of the relationships between drug exposure and bacterial killing, resistance suppression and toxicity. Recent non-clinical and clinical studies provide some useful insights and are reviewed here. Because LZD toxicity is dose- and duration-dependent, and is driven by elevated trough concentrations and prolonged exposure to concentrations inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis, several innovative dosing strategies can be employed to optimize its usage. These strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, may include giving higher doses more intermittently, giving higher daily doses for shorter durations, and giving lower total durations. For example, one approach may involve daily doses of 900-1200 mg for the first 1-3 months of treatment, followed by intermittent (e.g., thrice-weekly) dosing of 1200 mg.

Drug-resistant TB is associated with high mortality, is a threat to health care workers in TB-endemic countries and is prohibitively costly, which diverts resources away from drug-susceptible cases. Amplification of resistance means that there is an increasing proportion of patients with multidrug-resistant TB who have extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or are programmatically untreatable. Thus, new treatment options are urgently needed. Bedaquiline (BDQ) is the first new drug specifically developed for TB to be licensed for use in almost 40 years. BDQ has sterilising activity and also shows promise as a component of new treatment-shortening regimens for drug-susceptible TB. Here we review insights from the field into the use of BDQ, issues relevant to the practising clinician, implications for the selection for antiretroviral therapy, pharmacokinetic issues relevant to clinical practice and implications for combination therapy.

Data on treatment duration from animal models are increasingly a focus of such studies, but they have not been calibrated against human clinical trials and are lacking in MDR-TB. Empirical meta-regression models based on clinical trials in DS-TB suggest that early bacteriological results and treatment duration may have value in predicting relapse, and have been prospectively validated against the results of three large randomised controlled trials in DS-TB. While few trials have been conducted in MDR-TB to date, and observational cohort data should be interpreted carefully due to bias and confounding, these models also appeared to perform well in two recent cohort studies of MDR-TB. Applying these insights in practice may require innovations in clinical trial design, such as more extensive selection, adaptation and use of multiple durations during Phases II and III.

28225334,The tuberculosis taboo.,,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"The treatment of latent tuberculous infection (TBI) is a productive and meaningful approach to tuberculosis (TB) control, and an important component of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) new End TB Strategy, especially in high-risk contacts. Unfortunately, although recognized and recommended by the WHO, it continues to be underutilized, and has even been ignored for decades in some high-risk groups, as though it were a taboo. Historical approaches to treating TBI in contacts of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB are presented and discussed as compelling experiences. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently shown that a directly observed or even self-administered 12-month regimen to treat TBI with once-weekly isoniazid (INH) and rifapentine is as effective as 9 months of daily INH. Treating TBI in drug-susceptible cases and their contacts should not still be considered taboo-such a short, effective regimen is more akin to the Holy Grail. While not yet confirmed in a clinical trial, treating contacts of drug-resistant TB with the same drugs that are effective in the source case would be expected intuitively and practically to prevent TB in contacts and should be introduced now instead of waiting until clinical trials are completed.",,,,2017-02-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We started a trial to test whether the use of linezolid instead of ethambutol could increase the rate of sputum culture conversion as of 8 weeks of treatment in patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis.
This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized study with three arms. We are enrolling patients with pulmonary tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance screened by the Xpert MTB/RIF® assay. The standard treatment arm uses isoniazid (6 months), rifampicin (6 months), pyrazinamide (2 months), and ethambutol (2 months). Experimental arm 1 uses linezolid (600 mg/day) for 4 weeks instead of ethambutol. Experimental arm 2 uses linezolid (600 mg/day) for 2 weeks instead of ethambutol. The primary outcome is the sputum culture conversion rate on liquid media after 2 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes include the sputum culture conversion rate on solid media after 2 months of treatment, time to sputum culture conversion on liquid and solid media, cure rate, and treatment success rate. The frequencies of total adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs will be described and documented. Based on an α = 0.05 level of significance, a power of 85%, a 15% difference in the culture conversion rate after 2 months between the control arm and experimental arm 1 (75% vs. 90%), a 10% default (loss to follow-up) rate, and a 10% culture failure, the required number per arm was calculated to be 143 (429 in total).
This trial will reveal the effectiveness and safety of 2 or 4 weeks of use of linezolid instead of ethambutol for patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. If a new regimen including linezolid shows a higher culture conversion rate by week 8, and is safe, it could be tested as a 4-month antituberculosis treatment regimen in the future.

This serious pathogen has been greatly spread worldwide and recent years have observed an increase in the number of multi-drug resistant and totally drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains (WHO report, 2014). The danger of tuberculosis becoming an incurable disease has emphasized the need for the discovery of a new generation of antimicrobial agents. The development of novel alternative medical strategies, new drugs and the search for optimal drug targets are top priority areas of tuberculosis research.
Key characteristics of mycobacteria include: slow growth, the ability to transform into a metabolically silent - latent state, intrinsic drug resistance and the relatively rapid development of acquired drug resistance. These factors make finding an ideal antituberculosis drug enormously challenging, even if it is designed to treat drug sensitive tuberculosis strains. A vast majority of canonical antibiotics including antituberculosis agents target bacterial cell wall biosynthesis or DNA/RNA processing. Novel therapeutic approaches are being tested to target mycobacterial cell division, twocomponent regulatory factors, lipid synthesis and the transition between the latent and actively growing states.
This review discusses the choice of cellular targets for an antituberculosis therapy, describes putative drug targets evaluated in the recent literature and summarizes potential candidates under clinical and pre-clinical development. We focus on the key cellular process of DNA replication, as a prominent target for future antituberculosis therapy. We describe two main pathways: the biosynthesis of nucleic acids precursors - the nucleotides, and the synthesis of DNA molecules. We summarize data regarding replication associated proteins that are critical for nucleotide synthesis, initiation, unwinding and elongation of the DNA during the replication process. They are pivotal processes required for successful multiplication of the bacterial cells and hence they are extensively investigated for the development of antituberculosis drugs. Finally, we summarize the most potent inhibitors of DNA synthesis and provide an up to date report on their status in the clinical trials.",,,,2017-02-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
28109869,"Outcomes, infectiousness, and transmission dynamics of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and home-discharged patients with programmatically incurable tuberculosis: a prospective cohort study.",,The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,"The emergence of programmatically incurable tuberculosis threatens to destabilise control efforts. The aim of this study was to collect prospective patient-level data to inform treatment and containment strategies.
In a prospective cohort study, 273 South African patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or resistance beyond extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, were followed up over a period of 6 years. Transmission dynamics, infectiousness, and drug susceptibility were analysed in a subset of patients from the Western Cape using whole-genome sequencing (WGS; n=149), a cough aerosol sampling system (CASS; n=26), and phenotypic testing for 18 drugs (n=179).
Between Oct 1, 2008, and Oct 31, 2012, we enrolled and followed up 273 patients for a median of 20·3 months (IQR 9·6-27·8). 203 (74%) had programmatically incurable tuberculosis and unfavourable outcomes (treatment failure, relapse, default, or death despite treatment with a regimen based on capreomycin, aminosalicylic acid, or both). 172 (63%) patients were discharged home, of whom 104 (60%) had an unfavourable outcome. 54 (31%) home-discharged patients had failed treatment, with a median time to death after discharge of 9·9 months (IQR 4·2-17·4). 35 (20%) home-discharged cases were smear-positive at discharge. Using CASS, six (23%) of 26 home-discharged cases with data available expectorated infectious culture-positive cough aerosols in the respirable range (<5 μm), and most reported inter-person contact with suboptimal protective mask usage. WGS identified 17 (19%) of the 90 patients (with available sequence data) that were discharged home before the diagnosis of 20 downstream cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis with almost identical sequencing profiles suggestive of community-based transmission (five or fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms different and with identical resistance-encoding mutations for 14 drugs). 11 (55%) of these downstream cases had HIV co-infection and ten (50%) had died by the end of the study. 22 (56%) of 39 isolates in patients discharged home after treatment failure were resistant to eight or more drugs. However, five (16%) of 31 isolates were susceptible to rifabutin and more than 90% were likely to be sensitive to linezolid, bedaquiline, and delamanid.
More than half of the patients with programmatically incurable tuberculosis were discharged into the community where they remained for an average of 16 months, were at risk of expectorating infectious cough aerosols, and posed a threat of transmission of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Urgent action, including appropriate containment strategies, is needed to address this situation. Access to delamanid, bedaquiline, linezolid, and rifabutin, when appropriate, must be accelerated along with comprehensive drug susceptibility testing.

To determine whether the four-drug fixed-dose combination is safer or more effective than separate drugs for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.
A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

28045934,Priority-Setting for Novel Drug Regimens to Treat Tuberculosis: An Epidemiologic Model.,,PLoS medicine,"Novel drug regimens are needed for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. New regimens aim to improve on characteristics such as duration, efficacy, and safety profile, but no single regimen is likely to be ideal in all respects. By linking these regimen characteristics to a novel regimen's ability to reduce TB incidence and mortality, we sought to prioritize regimen characteristics from a population-level perspective.
We developed a dynamic transmission model of multi-strain TB epidemics in hypothetical populations reflective of the epidemiological situations in India (primary analysis), South Africa, the Philippines, and Brazil. We modeled the introduction of various novel rifampicin-susceptible (RS) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB regimens that differed on six characteristics, identified in consultation with a team of global experts: (1) efficacy, (2) duration, (3) ease of adherence, (4) medical contraindications, (5) barrier to resistance, and (6) baseline prevalence of resistance to the novel regimen. We compared scale-up of these regimens to a baseline reflective of continued standard of care. For our primary analysis situated in India, our model generated baseline TB incidence and mortality of 157 (95% uncertainty range [UR]: 113-187) and 16 (95% UR: 9-23) per 100,000 per year at the time of novel regimen introduction and RR TB incidence and mortality of 6 (95% UR: 4-10) and 0.6 (95% UR: 0.3-1.1) per 100,000 per year. An optimal RS TB regimen was projected to reduce 10-y TB incidence and mortality in the India-like scenario by 12% (95% UR: 6%-20%) and 11% (95% UR: 6%-20%), respectively, compared to current-care projections. An optimal RR TB regimen reduced RR TB incidence by an estimated 32% (95% UR: 18%-46%) and RR TB mortality by 30% (95% UR: 18%-44%). Efficacy was the greatest determinant of impact; compared to a novel regimen meeting all minimal targets only, increasing RS TB treatment efficacy from 94% to 99% reduced TB mortality by 6% (95% UR: 1%-13%, half the impact of a fully optimized regimen), and increasing the efficacy against RR TB from 76% to 94% lowered RR TB mortality by 13% (95% UR: 6%-23%). Reducing treatment duration or improving ease of adherence had smaller but still substantial impact: shortening RS TB treatment duration from 6 to 2 mo lowered TB mortality by 3% (95% UR: 1%-6%), and shortening RR TB treatment from 20 to 6 mo reduced RR TB mortality by 8% (95% UR: 4%-13%), while reducing nonadherence to the corresponding regimens by 50% reduced TB and RR TB mortality by 2% (95% UR: 1%-4%) and 6% (95% UR: 3%-10%), respectively. Limitations include sparse data on key model parameters and necessary simplifications to model structure and outcomes.
In designing clinical trials of novel TB regimens, investigators should consider that even small changes in treatment efficacy may have considerable impact on TB-related incidence and mortality. Other regimen improvements may still have important benefits for resource allocation and outcomes such as patient quality of life.",,,,2017-01-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
28043624,"New insights into the mechanism of action of pyrazinamide, implications for susceptibility testing, and future regimens.","MDR-TB, Pyrazinamide",International journal of mycobacteriology,"Pyrazinamide (PZA) is included in the 2016 World Health Organization multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment guidelines and is a key component of most ongoing clinical trials investigating novel antibiotic combinations. PZA resistance is associated with worse tuberculosis treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, for such an important drug, phenotypic susceptibility testing is extremely challenging. The exacting bacterial growth conditions required to induce susceptibility to the drug reduce the accuracy of the susceptibility assay, even in experienced laboratories, and widespread testing is not performed. This situation is unacceptable for such a valuable and important drug. A more complete understanding of the mechanism of action of PZA would be expected to lead to improvements in this situation. Although the exact mechanism of action of PZA is not known yet, it is widely accepted that PZA is a prodrug requiring transformation to pyrazinoic acid, the active form, by the mycobacterial enzyme encoded by the pncA gene. Most clinical resistance indeed appears to be a result of a diverse range of mutations in this gene and sequencing of the pncA gene has been shown to have excellent predictive power for PZA resistance. The wider availably of pncA sequencing in combination with databases of the phenotypic implications of these mutations has helped make genetic testing for PZA resistance a practical proposition. For the past decades, it has been generally accepted that an extracellular low pH is required for PZA activity but work in our laboratory [1] and others [2] has recently challenged this assumption. Alternative bacterial stresses, apart from a reduced pH of the growth media (such as reduced temperature), can also induce a PZA-susceptible phenotype. The characterization of spontaneous in vitro-resistant pyrazinoic acid mutants selected under neutral pH conditions suggests a key role for the pantothenate/coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway. This has profound implications for the mechanism of action of PZA as well as potentially the bacterial population against which PZA is active in the host. These findings will be discussed as well as their implications for further research and the future of PZA susceptibility testing.",,,,2017-01-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The clinical isolate of MTB from a patient who harbored confirmed tuberculosis was used in the study. Aqueous extracts of Aloe vera leaves, mint, and Hypericum perforatum were prepared using reflux distillation. Disk diffusion methods were conducted in Petri dishes and McCartney bottles containing Löwenstein-Jensen medium to measure the sensitivity of plant extracts in serial concentrations of 0.25-8mg/mL. A pour plate method was performed by mixing 0.7mL of each concentration of extract in 5mL Löwenstein-Jensen medium followed by surface culturing of MTB fresh cells.

The prevalence of these Rv0678 RAVs in clinical isolates and their impact on treatment outcomes are important factors to take into account in bedaquiline treatment guidelines.
Baseline isolates from two bedaquiline MDR-TB clinical trials were sequenced for Rv0678 RAVs and corresponding bedaquiline MICs were determined on 7H11 agar. Rv0678 RAVs were also investigated in non-MDR-TB sequences of a population-based cohort.
Rv0678 RAVs were identified in 23/347 (6.3%) of MDR-TB baseline isolates. Surprisingly, bedaquiline MICs for these isolates were high (> 0.24 mg/L, n  =   8), normal (0.03-0.24 mg/L, n  =   11) or low (< 0.03 mg/L, n  =   4). A variant at position -11 in the intergenic region mmpS5 - Rv0678 was identified in 39 isolates (11.3%) and appeared to increase the susceptibility to bedaquiline. In non-MDR-TB isolates, the frequency of Rv0678 RAVs was lower (6/852 or 0.7%). Competition experiments suggested that rifampicin was not the drug selecting for Rv0678 RAVs.
RAVs in Rv0678 occur more frequently in MDR-TB patients than previously anticipated, are not associated with prior use of bedaquiline or clofazimine, and in the majority of cases do not lead to bedaquiline MICs above the provisional breakpoint (0.24 mg/L).

We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccine (HVJ-E/HSP65 DNA +IL-12 DNA). [Methods and Results] DNA vaccine expressing TB heat shock protein 65 and IL-12 was delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy and strong therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB and XDR-TB in murine models. Furthermore, this vaccine provided therapeutic efficacy of prolongation of survival time of TB infected monkeys and augmented the immune responses. Therefore, the preclinical tests were studied for clinical trial. The injection of 100 μg of the vaccine /mouse i.m. three times in two weeks induced significantly strong production of IFN-γ and IL-2. 100 μg and 200 μg DNA vaccine/mouse i.m. augmented the production of these cytokines compared with 25 μg DNA vaccine/mouse i.m.. The ratio of 100 μg pDNA to 1AU HVJ-E enhanced the production of IFN-γ and IL-2. The decrease in the number of M. tuberculosis in liver of mice was observed by the vaccination of 100μg pDNA. By using these conditions, safety pharmacology study and toxicology test is being studied in monkeys administered by GMP level DNA vaccines. By the toxicology test using monkeys, high dose GMP level vaccine/ monkey is administrated. Safety pharmacological study of repeated administration is also being investigated in GLP level. Furthermore, we have planned to do clinical phase I trial. Targets are human patients with MDR-TB. The safety and tolerability of the vaccine will be evaluated. [Conclusion and recommendations] These data indicate that our novel vaccine might be useful against tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical applications.",,,,2016-12-15,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Effectively treating LTBI will be essential if the End TB Strategy is to be realized. This review evaluates the evidence in relation to the effectiveness of preventive antibiotic therapy to treat LTBI due to both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacteria. Current national and international preventive therapy guidelines are summarized, as well as ongoing randomized trials evaluating regimens to prevent drug-resistant TB. Populations that may benefit most from screening and treatment for LTBI include close contacts of patients with TB (particularly children under 5 years of age) and individuals with substantial immunological impairment. The risks and benefits of treatment must be carefully balanced for each individual. Electronic decision support tools offer one way in which clinicians can help patients to make informed decisions. Modelling studies indicate that the expanded use of preventive therapy will be essential to achieving substantial reductions in the global TB burden.

A bold vision is needed from global leaders to end the TB epidemic and plans to this end have been proposed. However enthusiasm must be matched by tangible and achievable goals based on the science and available funding. In order to reach the target and goals set by the WHO End TB Strategy, the challenges for TB eradication need to be addressed. In order to achieve the targets, several areas need to be bolstered, including the requirement to better identify and treat existing drug-susceptible cases and diagnose all the drug-resistant forms of the disease. Although treatment is available for most TB patients, stock-outs and other delays are problematic in some settings, resulting in ongoing transmission, especially for the drug-resistant forms of the disease. Despite the fact that a majority of multidrug-resistant cases are linked to treatment, the cure rate is only 50%, which highlights the need for safer, shorter, and more efficacious drug regimens that are more tolerable to patients. Prospects for a more efficacious vaccine are limited, with no correlates of protection identified; thus the availability of a vaccine by 2025 is highly improbable. Support for instituting infection control methods should be prioritized to subvert transmission while patients seek treatment and care. Finally, more adequate financial mechanisms should be instituted to reduce patient expenditures and support national TB programs. Moreover, funding to support basic science, drug development, clinical trials, vaccine development, diagnostics, and implementation research needs to be secured in order to reduce global TB incidence in the future.",,,,2016-11-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The current treatment for patients with MDR-TB takes up to 24 months to complete. Evidence for a shorter regimen which differs from the standard WHO recommended MDR-TB regimen and typically lasts between 9 and 12 months has been reported from Bangladesh. This evaluation aims to assess the economic impact of a shortened regimen on patients and health systems. This evaluation is innovative as it combines patient and health system costs, as well as operational modelling in assessing the impact.
An economic evaluation nested in a clinical trial with 2 arms will be performed at 4 facilities. The primary outcome measure is incremental cost to the health system of the study regimen compared with the control regimen. Secondary outcome measures are mean incremental costs incurred by patients by treatment outcome; patient costs by category (direct medical costs, transport, food and accommodation costs, and cost of guardians/accompanying persons and lost time); health systems cost by category and drugs; and costs related to serious adverse events.

Together, the strengthened ICF intervention and Xpert activation are referred to as the ""Xpert package"".
The evaluation, called the Xpert Package Rollout Evaluation using a Stepped-wedge design (XPRES), has two key objectives: (1) to compare sensitivity of microscopy-based and Xpert-based pulmonary TB diagnostic algorithms in diagnosing sputum culture-positive TB; and (2) to evaluate impact of the ""Xpert package"" on all-cause, 6-month, adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality. A pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial design was chosen. The design involves enrollment of three cohorts: (1) cohort R, a retrospective cohort of all study clinic ART enrollees in the 24 months before study initiation (July 31, 2012); (2) cohort A, a prospective cohort of all consenting patients presenting to study clinics after study initiation, who received the ICF intervention and the microscopy-based TB diagnostic algorithm; and (3) cohort B, a prospective cohort of all consenting patients presenting to study clinics after Xpert activation, who received the ICF intervention and the Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithm. TB diagnostic sensitivity will be compared between TB culture-positive enrollees in cohorts A and B. All-cause, 6-month ART-mortality will be compared between cohorts R and B. With anticipated cohort R, A, and B sample sizes of about 10,131, 1,878, and 4,258, respectively, the study is estimated to have >80 % power to detect differences in pre-versus post-Xpert TB diagnostic sensitivity if pre-Xpert sensitivity is ≤52.5 % and post-Xpert sensitivity ≥82.5 %, and >80 % power to detect a 40 % reduction in all-cause, 6-month, ART mortality between cohorts R and B if cohort R mortality is ≥13/100 person-years.
Only one small previous trial (N = 424) among ART enrolees in Zimbabwe evaluated, in a secondary analysis, Xpert impact on all-cause 6-month ART mortality. No mortality impact was observed. This Botswana trial, with its larger sample size and powered specifically to detect differences in all-cause 6-month ART mortality, remains well-positioned to contribute understanding of Xpert impact.

In this review, we examine the current evidence on the activity of carbapenems against M. tuberculosis. The predominance of work is in vitro, and suggests that carbapenems kill M. tuberculosis at least in the active phase, with possible greater potency with the addition of a β-lactamase inhibitor. The few in vivo and clinical studies suggest that there are benefits and that they are generally tolerated, although the variability in duration, dosing, and background regimen and lack of pharmacokinetic analyses limit interpretation of efficacy.

They secrete growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines and express Toll-like receptors on their surface, although multiple cell biological mechanisms remain unclear. MSCs are multi-potent and can differentiate into many cell types including adipocytes, neuronal cells and osteoclasts. Despite gaps in cell biology, because of their immunomodulatory and regenerative capacity, several hundred clinical trials have used MSCs for therapy of cancer, autoimmune diseases and control of inflammation during organ transplantation. MSCs secrete immune-modulatory factors and are able to skew T cell responses and shift M1 to M2 differentiation of macrophages. We review the emerging role of MSCs to act as phagocytes for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its role during the persistence of M. tuberculosis and spread of infection. Paradoxically, MSCs use innate defense mechanisms of autophagy and nitric oxide to inhibit the growth of intracellular M. tuberculosis. In addition, transplantation with autologous MSCs improved the clinical condition of patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. Thus, in addition to the well-known immune defense played by macrophages, DCs, classical T cells and non-classical immune cells, MSCs have emerged as a fifth element capable of regulating immune responses during tuberculosis.

Series B, Biological sciences","Tuberculosis remains a scourge of global health with shrinking treatment options due to the spread of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Intensive efforts have been made in the past 15 years to find leads for drug development so that better, more potent drugs inhibiting new targets could be produced and thus shorten treatment duration. Initial attempts focused on repurposing drugs that had been developed for other therapeutic areas but these agents did not meet their goals in clinical trials. Attempts to find new lead compounds employing target-based screens were unsuccessful as the leads were inactive against M. tuberculosis Greater success was achieved using phenotypic screening against live tubercle bacilli and this gave rise to the drugs bedaquiline, pretomanid and delamanid, currently in phase III trials. Subsequent phenotypic screens also uncovered new leads and targets but several of these targets proved to be promiscuous and inhibited by a variety of seemingly unrelated pharmacophores. This setback sparked an interest in alternative screening approaches that mimic the disease state more accurately. Foremost among these were cell-based screens, often involving macrophages, as these should reflect the bacterium's niche in the host more faithfully. A major advantage of this approach is its ability to uncover functions that are central to infection but not necessarily required for growth in vitro For instance, inhibition of virulence functions mediated by the ESX-1 secretion system severely attenuates intracellular M. tuberculosis, preventing intercellular spread and ultimately limiting tissue damage. Cell-based screens have highlighted the druggability of energy production via the electron transport chain and cholesterol metabolism.

However, recent trials of Xpert impact have not demonstrated reductions in patient morbidity and mortality. We conducted a narrative review of Xpert impact trials to summarize which patient-relevant outcomes Xpert has improved and explore reasons for no observed morbidity or mortality reductions. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Embase and identified eight trials meeting inclusion criteria: three individually randomized, three cluster-randomized, and two pre-post trials. In six trials Xpert increased diagnostic yield of bacteriologically-confirmed TB from sputa and in four trials Xpert shortened time to TB treatment. However, all-cause mortality was similar between arms in all six trials reporting this outcome, and the only trial to assess Xpert impact on morbidity reported no impact. Trial characteristics that might explain lack of observed impact on morbidity and mortality include: higher rates of empiric TB treatment in microscopy compared with Xpert arms, enrollment of study populations not comprised exclusively of populations most likely to benefit from Xpert, and health system weaknesses.

Changes in regulatory pathways by the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency place great emphasis on the use of preclinical models coupled with pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to rapidly and safely move new molecular entities with activity against multi-resistant pathogens through the approval process and into the treatment of patients. In this manuscript, the use of the murine pneumonia system and the Hollow Fiber Infection Model is displayed and the way in which the mathematical analysis of the data arising from these models contributes to the robust choice of dose and schedule for Phase 3 clinical trials is shown. These data and their proper analysis act to de-risk the conduct of Phase 3 trials for anti-infective agents. These trials are the most expensive part of drug development. Further, given the seriousness of the infections treated, they represent the riskiest element for patients. Consequently, these preclinical model systems and their proper analysis have become a central part of accelerated anti-infective development. A final contention of this manuscript is that it is possible to embed these models and in particular, the Hollow Fiber Infection Model earlier in the drug discovery/development process. Examples of 'dynamic driver switching' and the impact of this phenomenon on clinical trial outcome are provided. Identifying dynamic drivers early in drug discovery may lead to improved decision making in the lead optimization process, resulting in the best molecules transitioning to clinical development.",,,,2016-09-11,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The databases Medline, Embase, Biosis, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCI, CBM, VIP and CNKI were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) of V5 immunitor with or without a placebo-control as adjuvant therapy in the chemotherapy of TB patients were included. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction and quality assessment. Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Four studies were included. At the end of the follow-up period, pooled RR (Risk Ratio) and its 95% CI of sputum smear conversion rate were 4.91 (3.32, 7.28) in drug-sensitive, drug-resistant TB patients or HIV-TB co-infection patients. When analyzing inflammation biomarkers including ESR and leukocyte accounts, pooled mean difference and its 95% CI of ESR and leukocyte accounts were -7.62 (-9.55, -5.68) and -2.13 (-2.58, -1.68), respectively. As to body weight, pooled mean difference and its 95% CI were 0.96 (-1.13, 3.05) in TB patients. Two clinical trials were included for analyzing temperature after using V5 immunitor, pooled mean difference and its 95% CI were -0.34 (-0.46, -0.22) in TB patients. These results suggested that V5 immunitor holds important promise in improving sputum conversion to AFB- and inhibiting inflammatory reaction in TB patients, but showed no significant promotion to the increase in body weight based on this meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, V5 immunitor may have some potential in decreasing the temperature of TB patients. No systemic adverse events were reported.

We built a response-adaptive randomization procedure, adapting on two preliminary outcomes for tuberculosis patients in a trial with five experimental regimens and a control arm. The primary study outcome is treatment success after 73 weeks from randomization; preliminary responses are culture conversion at 8 weeks and treatment success at 39 weeks. We compared the adaptive randomization design with balanced randomization using hypothetical scenarios.
When we compare the statistical power under adaptive randomization and non-adaptive designs, under several hypothetical scenarios we observe that adaptive randomization requires fewer patients than non-adaptive designs. Moreover, adaptive randomization consistently allocates more participants to effective arm(s). We also show that these advantages are limited to scenarios consistent with the assumptions used to develop the adaptive randomization algorithm.
Given the objective of evaluating several new therapeutic regimens in a timely fashion, Bayesian response-adaptive designs are attractive for tuberculosis trials.

In order to manage the problem effectively it is important to know the burden of TB in health care workers. This systematic review describes the epidemiology of TB in South African health care workers.
A comprehensive search of electronic databases [MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science (Social Sciences Citation Index/Science Citation Index), Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL register of Controlled Trials), CINAHL and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)] was conducted up to April 2015 for studies reporting on any aspect of TB epidemiology in health care workers in South Africa.
Of the 16 studies included in the review, ten studies reported on incidence of active TB disease in health care workers, two report on the prevalence of active TB disease, two report on the incidence of latent TB infection, three report on the prevalence of latent TB infection and four studies report on the number of TB cases in health care workers in various health care facilities in South Africa. Five studies provide information on risk factors for TB in health care workers. All of the included studies were conducted in publicly funded health care facilities; predominately located in KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces. The majority of the studies reflect a higher incidence and prevalence of active TB disease in health care workers, including drug-resistant TB, compared to the surrounding community or general population.
There is relatively little research on the epidemiology of TB in health care workers in South Africa, despite the importance of the issue. To determine the true extent of the TB epidemic in health care workers, regular screening for TB disease should be conducted on all health care workers in all health care facilities, but future research is required to investigate the optimal approach to TB screening in health care workers in South Africa. The evidence base shows a high burden of both active and latent TB in health care workers in South Africa necessitating an urgent need to improve existing TB infection, prevention and control measures in South African health care facilities.",,"Of the 16 studies included in the review, ten studies reported on incidence of active TB disease in health care workers, two report on the prevalence of active TB disease, two report on the incidence of latent TB infection, three report on the prevalence of latent TB infection and four studies report on the number of TB cases in health care workers in various health care facilities in South Africa.

27458223,Delamanid Coadministered with Antiretroviral Drugs or Antituberculosis Drugs Shows No Clinically Relevant Drug-Drug Interactions in Healthy Subjects.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Delamanid is a medicinal product approved for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between delamanid and antiretroviral drugs, including ritonavir, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and selected anti-TB drugs, including rifampin, a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. Multiple-dose studies were conducted in parallel groups of healthy subjects. Plasma samples were analyzed for delamanid, delamanid metabolite, and coadministered drug concentrations, and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined. The magnitude of the interaction was assessed by the ratio of the geometric means and 90% confidence intervals. Coadministration of delamanid with tenofovir or efavirenz did not affect the PK characteristics of delamanid. Coadministration of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) with delamanid resulted in an approximately 25% higher delamanid area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the end of the dosing interval (AUCτ). Tenofovir, efavirenz, lopinavir, and ritonavir exposure were not affected by delamanid. Coadministration of delamanid with the TB drugs (ethambutol plus Rifater [rifampin, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid]) resulted in lower delamanid exposures (47 and 42% for the AUCτ and Cmax [maximum concentration of a drug in plasma] values, respectively), as well as decreased exposure of three primary metabolites (approximately 30 to 50% lower AUCτ values). Delamanid did not affect rifampin, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid exposure; the ethambutol AUCτ and Cmax values were about 25% higher with delamanid coadministration. The lack of clinically significant drug-drug interactions between delamanid and selected antiretroviral agents (including the strong CYP inhibitor ritonavir) and a combination of anti-TB drugs was demonstrated. Although there was a decrease in the delamanid concentrations when coadministered with ethambutol plus Rifater, this is likely related to decreased delamanid absorption and not to CYP induction.",,,,2016-07-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
27430526,CD137-CRDI is not necessary in the role of contacting its natural ligand.,,Immunology and cell biology,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors result in impressive clinical responses and are expanding to treat a wide variety of tumors. One common problem is low responses from current clinical trials that only benefit a fraction of patients. One key promising direction is combination therapy to increase clinical benefit. CD137, a well-defined antitumor target, can cause strong co-stimulating activity and break immune tolerance. In this study, the role of CD137-CRDI (cysteine rich domain I) in the binding of CD137-CD137L was further investigated based on our previous work. The results revealed that CRDI-mediated limited CD137 assembly without relying on CD137L. Furthermore, CRDI was not involved in direct contact with CD137L in either mice or humans. Isolated mouse CRDII and human CRDII+CRDIII were proven to be the minimum unit for interface with their respective ligands.

Bedaquiline is a first-in-class diaryl-quinoline compound, that mechanistically inhibits the bacterial ATP-synthase, and shows potent activity against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Interestingly, eukaryotic mitochondria originally evolved from engulfed aerobic bacteria. Thus, we hypothesized that, in mammalian cells, bedaquiline might also target the mitochondrial ATP-synthase, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion. Here, we show that bedaquiline has anti-cancer activity, directed against Cancer Stem-like Cells (CSCs). More specifically, we demonstrate that bedaquiline treatment of MCF7 breast cancer cells inhibits mitochondrial oxygen-consumption, as well as glycolysis, but induces oxidative stress. Importantly, bedaquiline significantly blocks the propagation and expansion of MCF7-derived CSCs, with an IC-50 of approx. 1-μM, as determined using the mammosphere assay. Similarly, bedaquiline also reduces both the CD44+/CD24low/- CSC and ALDH+ CSC populations, under anchorage-independent growth conditions. In striking contrast, bedaquiline significantly increases oxygen consumption in normal human fibroblasts, consistent with the fact that it is well-tolerated in patients treated for TB infections. As such, future pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials in cancer patients may be warranted. Interestingly, we also highlight that bedaquiline shares certain structural similarities with trans-piceatannol and trans-resveratrol, which are known natural flavonoid inhibitors of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase (complex V) and show anti-aging properties.",,,,2016-06-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In spite of consistent efforts being made, the disease has not been curtailed yet. The emergence of MDR and XDR strains in the society along with an increase in the number of HIV cases and that of latent TB, have further aggravated the problem making the disease very much persistent. The current situation clearly manifests the need to discover and develop new potent molecules/approaches that could help to tackle drug resistance. Various molecules, such as derivatives of fluoroquinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and DC-159a), rifamycins (rifapentine), oxazolidinones (linezolid, sutezolid/PNU-100480), diarylquinolines (TMC207/bedaquiline), antifungal azoles, pyrrole (LL3858), nitroimidazopyran (PA824), nitroimidazole (OPC67683, TBA-354), diamine (SQ109) and benzothiazinone (BTZ043) are being developed in an attempt to combat the disease. This review presents a general introduction to the current status of the disease, the biology of the pathogen as well as the state of drug development against tuberculosis (TB) with emphasis on the major problems and bottlenecks associated with the same.

Among many factors that contribute to the development of resistance, low drug exposure is not the least important. This review summarizes the available information on pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin in relation to microbial susceptibilities, in order to optimize the dose and make general treatment recommendations. A total of 37 studies on adult (32 studies) and paediatric (5 studies) MDR-TB patients were included. Among the 32 adult studies, 19 were on susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to levofloxacin by MIC, 1 was on susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates to levofloxacin by MBC, 1 was on susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates to levofloxacin by mutant prevention concentration and 4 were on pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin, and 7 others were included. Likewise, out of five studies on children, two dealt with levofloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters, one reviewed CSF concentrations and two dealt with background information. In adult MDR-TB patients, standard dosing of once-daily 1000 mg levofloxacin in TB treatment did not consistently attain the target concentration (i.e. fAUC/MIC >100 and fAUC/MBC >100) in 80% of the patients with MIC and MBC of 1 mg/L, leaving them at risk of developing drug resistance. However, with an MIC of 0.5 mg/L, 100% of the patients achieved the target concentration. Similarly, paediatric patients failed consistently in achieving given pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets due to age-related differences, demanding a shift towards once daily dosing of 15-20 mg/kg. Therefore, we recommend therapeutic drug monitoring for patients with strains having MICs of ≥0.5 mg/L and suggest revising the cut-off value from 2 to 1 mg/L.",,,,2016-05-28,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

This has led to the resurgence in repurposing existing drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for anti-TB treatment.
Evidence from novel drug screening in vitro, in vivo, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analyses and clinical trials has been used for the preparation of this systematic review of the potential of NSAIDs for use as an adjunct in new TB chemotherapies.
Certain NSAIDs have demonstrated inhibitory properties towards actively replicating, dormant and drug-resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis cells.
NSAIDs are a diverse class of drugs, which have reported off-target activities, and their endogenous antimicrobial mechanism(s) of action is still unclear.

Current and Prospective Approaches in Anti-Tubercular Therapy.,,Current medicinal chemistry,"Ineffectively treated tuberculosis (TB) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Cure of TB patients is hampered by the development of multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis and the need of long-term treatment. The diarylquinoline derivative bedaquiline was approved in December 2012 under the accelerated-approval regulations of FDA as part of a combination therapy for treating adults with pulmonary MDR-TB for whom effective cures are not otherwise available. The bicyclic nitroimidazoles delamanid and its companion pretomanid inhibit mycolic acid synthesis via an unknown mechanism. In November 2013, delamanid received conditional approval by the European Medicines Agency for MDR-TB treatment. Use of both drugs, however, is limited owing to toxicity issues. If the aim to reduce treatment duration is pursued in order to limit costs and improve patient adherence, it is mandatory to demonstrate their noninferiority with fewer months of therapy. In three phase III clinical trials the efficacy of the most recent fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, has been investigated in a four-month treatment regimen of drug-susceptible TB. In all three studies, after two months the culture conversion rates of observed sputum indicated that fluoroquinolone-based therapies were likely to be superior. However, this feature did not reliably predict sterilizing activity or a risk of relapse. In other words, the shortened treatments were not noninferior to standard treatments. To counteract mycobacterial survival strategies and reduce the timelength of treatment with anti-TB drugs, other novel and powerful agents, as well as tuberculosis vaccines, are under intense clinical investigation for safety and efficacy assessment.",,,,2016-05-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The information regarding absorption, tissue distribution, elimination and pharmacokinetic interactions of the first- and second-line anti-TB drugs and candidate drugs under clinical trials is discussed.
Pharmacokinetic properties such as poor absorption, too short biological half-life, extensive first-pass metabolism, drug-food and drug-drug related interactions are not attractive for prospective anti-TB drugs and significantly contribute to treatment failure and further resistance. The long duration, monotonous and multidrug treatment plan leads to poor patient compliance and resulted in a greater occurrence of anti-TB drug resistance worldwide.

This study aimed to prove the non-inferiority of empirical therapy in our hospital compared with guideline-concordant therapy.
This was a randomized controlled trial conducted from December 2011 to December 2012. Patients were randomized to the Guideline group receiving guideline-concordant therapy, and the Empiric group treated with sulbactam/ampicillin or ceftriaxone. The primary endpoint was in-hospital relapse of pneumonia and mortality within 30 days, with a predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The secondary endpoints included duration, adverse effects, and cost of antibiotic therapy.
One hundred and eleven patients were assigned to the Guideline group (n = 55) and the Empiric group (n = 56; 3 of which were excluded). The incidence of relapse and death within 30 days was similar in the Guideline and the Empiric groups (31% vs. 26%, risk difference -4.5%, 95% CI -21.5% to 12.5%). While the duration of antibiotic therapy was slightly shorter in the Guideline group than in the Empiric group (7 vs. 8 days), there were no significant differences in adverse effects or cost.
The efficacy of empiric therapy was comparable to guideline-concordant therapy, although non-inferiority was not proven. The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients at risk of exposure to drug-resistant pathogens may not necessarily improve the prognosis.

27055269,"The Impact of a Line Probe Assay Based Diagnostic Algorithm on Time to Treatment Initiation and Treatment Outcomes for Multidrug Resistant TB Patients in Arkhangelsk Region, Russia.",,PloS one,"In the Arkhangelsk region of Northern Russia, multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) rates in new cases are amongst the highest in the world. In 2014, MDR-TB rates reached 31.7% among new cases and 56.9% among retreatment cases. The development of new diagnostic tools allows for faster detection of both TB and MDR-TB and should lead to reduced transmission by earlier initiation of anti-TB therapy.
The PROVE-IT (Policy Relevant Outcomes from Validating Evidence on Impact) Russia study aimed to assess the impact of the implementation of line probe assay (LPA) as part of an LPA-based diagnostic algorithm for patients with presumptive MDR-TB focusing on time to treatment initiation with time from first-care seeking visit to the initiation of MDR-TB treatment rather than diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome, and to assess treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that the implementation of LPA would result in faster time to treatment initiation and better treatment outcomes.
A culture-based diagnostic algorithm used prior to LPA implementation was compared to an LPA-based algorithm that replaced BacTAlert and Löwenstein Jensen (LJ) for drug sensitivity testing. A total of 295 MDR-TB patients were included in the study, 163 diagnosed with the culture-based algorithm, 132 with the LPA-based algorithm.
Among smear positive patients, the implementation of the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 50 and 66 days compared to the culture-based algorithm (BacTAlert and LJ respectively, p<0.001). In smear negative patients, the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 78 days when compared to the culture-based algorithm (LJ, p<0.001). However, several weeks were still needed for treatment initiation in LPA-based algorithm, 24 days in smear positive, and 62 days in smear negative patients. Overall treatment outcomes were better in LPA-based algorithm compared to culture-based algorithm (p = 0.003). Treatment success rates at 20 months of treatment were higher in patients diagnosed with the LPA-based algorithm (65.2%) as compared to those diagnosed with the culture-based algorithm (44.8%). Mortality was also lower in the LPA-based algorithm group (7.6%) compared to the culture-based algorithm group (15.9%). There was no statistically significant difference in smear and culture conversion rates between the two algorithms.
The results of the study suggest that the introduction of LPA leads to faster time to MDR diagnosis and earlier treatment initiation as well as better treatment outcomes for patients with MDR-TB. These findings also highlight the need for further improvements within the health system to reduce both patient and diagnostic delays to truly optimize the impact of new, rapid diagnostics.",,"Among smear positive patients, the implementation of the LPA-based algorithm was associated with a median decrease in time to MDR-TB treatment initiation of 50 and 66 days compared to the culture-based algorithm (BacTAlert and LJ respectively, p<0.001).

These new drugs have prompted strengthened efforts in DR-TB clinical trials research, and there are now multiple ongoing and planned DR-TB clinical trials. To facilitate comparability and maximise policy impact, a common set of core research definitions is needed, and this paper presents a core set of efficacy and safety definitions as well as other important considerations in DR-TB clinical trials work. To elaborate these definitions, a search of clinical trials registries, published manuscripts and conference proceedings was undertaken to identify groups conducting trials of new regimens for the treatment of DR-TB. Individuals from these groups developed the core set of definitions presented here. Further work is needed to validate and assess the utility of these definitions but they represent an important first step to ensure there is comparability in clinical trials on multidrug-resistant TB.",,,,2016-04-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
27039310,What can we offer to 3 million MDRTB household contacts in 2016?,"Household contacts, Latent tuberculosis infection, Multidrug resistant tuberculosis",BMC medicine,"The diagnosis of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in any individual is the beginning of a prolonged and difficult therapeutic journey. It also marks the moment from which to begin consideration of how to manage close contacts. Preventive therapy for drug-susceptible latent tuberculosis infection has been demonstrated to be effective at reducing the risk of future disease; the stakes are higher when considering prevention of MDR-TB because treatment of active disease is more prolonged and toxic and much less effective. This has encouraged exploration of the potential utility of preventive therapy, with second-line agents, in reducing future incident drug-resistant TB.Three clinical trials of preventive therapy for contacts of patients with MDR-TB are starting in 2015/16; results will not be available until at least 2020, so what should be offered to exposed contacts in the interim?A recent policy brief, arising from a global consultation meeting of international experts, recommended preventive therapy based upon very limited available observational data. However the many known unknowns associated with this approach, include the high proportion of index-contact pairs with discordant drug susceptibility profiles and (even if susceptibilities are shared) the lack of data supporting the use of the selected agents in the treatment of latent infection (rather than active disease).It is important to acknowledge that the alternative to offering preventive therapy is not doing nothing. On the contrary, identified contacts should be maintained under close, active surveillance for 24 months, enabling early detection of active disease in the small proportion amongst whom this may occur. Such patients should benefit from less extensive disease at diagnosis and early access to individualized therapeutic regimens with improved treatment outcomes. Moreover the vast majority of contacts that do not develop disease will benefit from avoidance of potentially toxic, unnecessary therapy.Whether preventive therapy or close observation are implemented, national programmes should maintain a register of all contacts, interventions and 24 month outcomes; these will provide important performance metrics for programmatic management of MDRTB. If harmonized and standardized internationally, such a register could rapidly yield a wealth of observational data, to complement the trial results of the future.",,,,2016-04-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Infectious diseases,"Tuberculosis is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, with 9·6 million cases and 1·5 million deaths reported in 2014. WHO estimates 480,000 cases of these were multidrug resistant (MDR). Less than half of patients who entered into treatment for MDR tuberculosis successfully completed that treatment, mainly due to high mortality and loss to follow-up. These in turn illustrate weaknesses in current treatment regimens and national tuberculosis programmes, coupled with operational treatment challenges. In this Review we provide an update on recent developments in the tuberculosis drug-development pipeline (including new and repurposed antimicrobials and host-directed drugs) as they are applied to new regimens to shorten and improve outcomes of tuberculosis treatment. Several new or repurposed antimicrobial drugs are in advanced trial stages for MDR tuberculosis, and two new antimicrobial drug candidates are in early-stage trials. Several trials to reduce the duration of therapy in MDR and drug-susceptible tuberculosis are ongoing. A wide range of candidate host-directed therapies are being developed to accelerate eradication of infection, prevent new drug resistance, and prevent permanent lung injury. As these drugs have been approved for other clinical indications, they are now ready for repurposing for tuberculosis in phase 2 clinical trials. We assess risks associated with evaluation of new treatment regimens, and highlight opportunities to advance tuberculosis research generally through regulatory innovation in MDR tuberculosis. Progress in tuberculosis-specific biomarkers (including culture conversion, PET and CT imaging, and gene expression profiles) can support this innovation. Several global initiatives now provide unique opportunities to tackle the tuberculosis epidemic through collaborative partnerships between high-income countries and middle-income and low-income countries for clinical trials training and research, allowing funders to coordinate several national and regional programmes for greatest overall effect.",,,,2016-04-03,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

However, confounding by indication remains an important concern that can be addressed by incorporating individual patient covariates in different ways. We compared different analytic approaches to account for confounding in IPD from patients treated for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
Two antibiotic classes were evaluated, fluoroquinolones--considered the cornerstone of effective MDR-TB treatment--and macrolides, which are known to be safe, yet are ineffective in vitro. The primary outcome was treatment success against treatment failure, relapse or death. Effect estimates were obtained using multivariable and propensity-score based approaches.
Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were used in 28 included studies, within which 6,612 patients received a fluoroquinolone and 723 patients did not. Macrolides were used in 15 included studies, within which 459 patients received this class of antibiotics and 3,670 did not. Both standard multivariable regression and propensity score-based methods resulted in similar effect estimates for early and late generation fluoroquinolones, while macrolide antibiotics use was associated with reduced treatment success.
In this individual patient data meta-analysis, standard multivariable and propensity-score based methods of adjusting for individual patient covariates for observational studies yielded produced similar effect estimates.

27021329,Antitubercular Agent Delamanid and Metabolites as Substrates and Inhibitors of ABC and Solute Carrier Transporters.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Delamanid (Deltyba, OPC-67683) is the first approved drug in a novel class of nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazoles developed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis require treatment with multiple drugs, several of which have known drug-drug interactions. Transporters regulate drug absorption, distribution, and excretion; therefore, the inhibition of transport by one agent may alter the pharmacokinetics of another, leading to unexpected adverse events. Therefore, it is important to understand how delamanid affects transport activity. In the present study, the potencies of delamanid and its main metabolites as the substrates and inhibitors of various transporters were evaluated in vitro Delamanid was not transported by the efflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR1/ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), solute carrier (SLC) transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptides, or organic cation transporter 1. Similarly, metabolite 1 (M1) was not a substrate for any of these transporters except P-gp. Delamanid showed no inhibitory effect on ABC transporters MDR1, BCRP, and bile salt export pump (BSEP; ABCB11), SLC transporters, or organic anion transporters. M1 and M2 inhibited P-gp- and BCRP-mediated transport but did so only at the 50% inhibitory concentrations (M1, 4.65 and 5.71 μmol/liter, respectively; M2, 7.80 and 6.02 μmol/liter, respectively), well above the corresponding maximum concentration in plasma values observed following the administration of multiple doses in clinical trials. M3 and M4 did not affect the activities of any of the transporters tested.

27009031,Rifabutin: where do we stand in 2016?,,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,"Rifabutin is a spiro-piperidyl-rifamycin structurally closely related to rifampicin that shares many of its properties. We attempted to address the reasons why this drug, which was recently recognized as a WHO Essential Medicine, still had a far narrower range of indications than rifampicin, 24 years after its launch. In this comprehensive review of the classic and more recent rifabutin experimental and clinical studies, the current state of knowledge about rifabutin is depicted, relying on specific pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, antimicrobial properties, resistance data and side effects compared with rifampicin. There are consistent in vitro data and clinical studies showing that rifabutin has at least equivalent activity/efficacy and acceptable tolerance compared with rifampicin in TB and non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases. Clinical studies have emphasized the clinical benefits of low rifabutin liver induction in patients with AIDS under PIs, in solid organ transplant patients under immunosuppressive drugs or in patients presenting intolerable side effects related to rifampicin. The contribution of rifabutin for rifampicin-resistant, but rifabutin-susceptible, Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates according to the present breakpoints has been challenged and is now controversial. Compared with rifampicin, rifabutin's lower AUC is balanced by higher intracellular penetration and lower MIC for most pathogens.

Curtailing the transmission of tuberculosis remains a challenge especially in high burden countries. New developments in measuring correlates of protection are urgently needed to support the evaluation of vaccines. Similarly, despite progress in molecular diagnostics, better tools are required to identify resistance to antibiotics in multi and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis. Whole Genome Sequencing may lead to the next generation of assays to rapidly detect resistance and evaluate transmission. Advances on shortening treatment are hampered by the lack of a biomarker of cure which obviates the current long wait for relapses in trials.

Linezolid, the first marketed oxazolidinone, has shown also activity against Mycobaterium tuberculosis, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains. Recently, a second agent of this class (tedizolid) has been approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and other oxazolidinones are under active investigation in clinical trials.
In the present review, we consider factors that affect oxazolidinones pharmacokinetics and their role in reducing the effectiveness of these drugs and increasing the risk of drug-related adverse events. Furthermore, we review the potential role of strategies aimed at individualizing drug doses. A MEDLINE PubMed search for articles published from January 1990 to November 2015 was completed matching the terms oxazolidinones, linezolid, or tedizolid with pharmacokinetics, therapeutic drug monitoring, pharmacology or clinical trials. Moreover, additional studies were identified from the reference list of retrieved papers.
Consistent evidence is now available showing that therapeutic drug monitoring and guided individual dose optimization of linezolid is justified and feasible in clinical practice to improve tolerability and possibly response to therapy.

Delamanid is an anti-TB agent first approved in the European Union in 2014 for the treatment of pulmonary MDR-TB in adults. Using the agar proportion method, delamanid MIC was determined for 460 isolates: 316 from patients enrolled in a phase 2 global clinical trial, 76 from two phase 2 early bactericidal activity trials conducted in South Africa, and 68 isolates obtained outside clinical trials (45 from Japanese patients and 23 from South African patients). With the exception of two isolates, MICs ranged from 0.001 to 0.05 μg/ml, resulting in an MIC50 of 0.004 μg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.012 μg/ml. Various degrees of resistance to other anti-TB drugs did not affect the distribution of MICs, nor did origin of isolates from regions/countries other than South Africa. A critical concentration/breakpoint of 0.2 μg/ml can be used to define susceptible and resistant isolates based on the distribution of MICs and available pharmacokinetic data. Thus, clinical isolates from delamanid-naive patients with tuberculosis have a very low MIC for delamanid and baseline resistance is rare, demonstrating the potential potency of delamanid and supporting its use in an optimized background treatment regimen for MDR-TB.",,,,2016-03-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
26960944,Towards new TB vaccines: What are the challenges?,,Pathogens and disease,"New and effective tuberculosis (TB) vaccines are urgently needed to control pulmonary TB, and in particular to prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These drug-resistant strains can range from those resistant to first-line drugs to those that are almost impossible to treat. To develop new and effective vaccines for HIV and malaria has been difficult and it is proving to be just as challenging for TB. TB is a complicated disease with a spectrum from apparently controlled latent infection to active clinical disease and so different types of preventive or post-exposure vaccine may be needed. Identifying the most promising vaccine candidates to move into clinical trials is difficult, as we lack biomarker signatures that can predict protective efficacy. There is a risk that the failure of the MVA-85A vaccine to show efficacy when given to previously BCG-vaccinated South African infants will impact on the resources available for the development and trials of other candidate TB vaccines. Continued support for the development of new TB vaccines should remain a priority as an effective vaccine would bring huge public health benefits.",,,,2016-03-11,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

While people working in such settings often provide high-quality care and perform operational research activities, they generally have less experience in conducting clinical trials designed for drug approval by stringent regulatory authorities.
We carried out a capacity-building programme during a multi-centre randomized controlled trial of delamanid, a new drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The programme included: (i) site identification and needs assessment; (ii) achieving International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) standards; (iii) establishing trial management; and (iv) increasing knowledge of global and local regulatory issues.
Trials were conducted at 17 sites in nine countries (China, Egypt, Estonia, Japan, Latvia, Peru, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America). Eight of the 10 sites in low-resource settings had no experience in conducting the requisite clinical trials.
Extensive capacity-building was done in all 10 sites. The programme resulted in improved local capacity in key areas such as trial design, data safety and monitoring, trial conduct and laboratory services.
Clinical trials designed to generate data for regulatory approval require additional efforts beyond traditional research-capacity strengthening. Such capacity-building approaches provide an opportunity for product development partnerships to improve health systems beyond the direct conduct of the specific trial.
Les nouveaux médicaments pour le traitement des maladies infectieuses doivent souvent être évalués dans des pays à faibles ressources.

Nous avons mené un programme de renforcement des capacités à l'occasion d'un essai contrôlé randomisé multicentrique du delamanid; un nouveau médicament pour le traitement de la tuberculose multirésistante. Ce programme comprenait : (i) l'identification des sites et l'évaluation des besoins; (ii) l'application des normes de la Conférence internationale sur l'harmonisation relatives aux bonnes pratiques cliniques (normes ICH-GCP); (iii) la mise en œuvre d'une gestion des essais; et (iv) l'amélioration des connaissances sur les aspects réglementaires locaux et internationaux.
Des essais ont été réalisés sur dix-sept sites, répartis dans neuf pays (Chine, Égypte, Estonie, États-Unis d'Amérique, Japon, Lettonie, Pérou, Philippines et République de Corée). Parmi les dix sites implantés dans des pays à faibles ressources, huit n'avaient aucune expérience dans la conduite des essais cliniques requis.
Un important renforcement des capacités a été réalisé sur l'ensemble des dix sites. Ce programme s'est traduit par une amélioration des capacités locales dans des domaines clés comme la conception des essais, la sécurité et le contrôle des données, la conduite des essais et les services de laboratoire.
Les essais cliniques conçus pour produire des données en vue d'obtenir l'approbation réglementaire nécessitent des efforts complémentaires, qui vont au-delà des activités traditionnelles de renforcement des capacités de recherche. Les approches de ce type visant à renforcer ces capacités offrent une opportunité de partenariat pour le développement de nouveaux produits en vue d'améliorer les systèmes de santé parallèlement à la réalisation directe des essais requis.

Программа по созданию потенциала была реализована во время многоцентрового рандомизированного контролируемого исследования деламанида — нового препарата для лечения туберкулеза со множественной лекарственной устойчивостью. Эта программа включала: (i) выявление места проведения исследования и оценку его потребностей; (ii) достижение соответствия стандартам Международной конференции по гармонизации и надлежащей клинической практике (ICH-GCP); (iii) внедрение управления исследованием; (iv) повышение осведомленности о мировых и местных вопросах нормативного регулирования.
Исследования были проведены в 17 центрах 9 стран (Египет, Китай, Латвия, Перу, Республика Корея, Соединенные Штаты Америки, Филиппины, Эстония, Япония). Восемь из десяти центров, расположенных в странах с низким уровнем ресурсов, не имели опыта проведения требуемых клинических исследований.
Во всех 10 центрах была проведена крупномасштабная работа по наращиванию потенциала для проведения исследований. В результате выполнения программы произошло укрепление местного потенциала в таких ключевых областях, как планирование хода исследования, защита данных и их мониторинг, проведение исследования и услуги лаборатории.
Клинические исследования, предназначенные для сбора данных, необходимых для получения законодательного разрешения, требуют совершения действий, выходящих за рамки традиционных мер по укреплению исследовательского потенциала. Такой подход к укреплению потенциала позволяет осуществлять партнерство с целью разработки продукции и улучшать системы здравоохранения для проведения более сложных мероприятий, чем отдельное исследование.",,,,2016-02-26,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

To compare final treatment outcomes between patients with MDR-TB randomized to levofloxacin or moxifloxacin.
A total of 151 participants with MDR-TB who were included for the final analysis in our previous trial were followed through the end of treatment. Treatment outcomes were compared between 77 patients in the levofloxacin group and 74 in the moxifloxacin group, based on the 2008 World Health Organization definitions as well as 2013 revised definitions of treatment outcomes. In addition, the time to culture conversion was compared between the two groups.
Treatment outcomes were not different between the two groups, based on 2008 World Health Organization definitions as well as 2013 definitions. With 2008 definitions, cure was achieved in 54 patients (70.1%) in the levofloxacin group and 54 (73.0%) in the moxifloxacin group (P = 0.72). Treatment success rates, including cure and treatment completed, were not different between the two groups (87.0 vs. 81.1%, P = 0.38). With 2013 definitions, cure rates (83.1 vs. 78.4%, P = 0.54) and treatment success rates (84.4 vs. 79.7%, P = 0.53) were also similar between the levofloxacin and moxifloxacin groups. Time to culture conversion was also not different between the two groups (27.0 vs. 45.0 d, P = 0.11 on liquid media; 17.0 vs. 42.0 d, P = 0.14 on solid media). Patients in the levofloxacin group had more adverse events than those in the moxifloxacin group (79.2 vs. 63.5%, P = 0.03), especially musculoskeletal ones (37.7 vs. 14.9%, P = 0.001).

Within a prospective, randomized controlled trial of linezolid to treat chronic extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, we serially monitored the translational competence of mitochondria isolated from peripheral blood of participants by determining the cytochrome c oxidase/citrate synthase activity ratio. We compared this ratio with AEs associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Linezolid trough concentrations were determined for 38 participants at both 600 mg and 300 mg doses. Those on 600 mg had a significantly higher risk of AE than those on 300 mg (HR 3·10, 95% CI 1·23-7 · 86). Mean mitochondrial function levels were significantly higher in patients before starting linezolid compared to their concentrations on 300 mg (P = 0·004) or 600 mg (P < 0·0001). Increasing mean linezolid trough concentrations were associated with lower mitochondrial function levels (Spearman's ρ = - 0.48; P = 0.005). Mitochondrial toxicity risk increased with increasing linezolid trough concentrations, with all patients with mean linezolid trough > 2 μg/ml developing an AE related to mitochondrial toxicity, whether on 300 mg or 600 mg. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful to prevent the development of mitochondrial toxicity associated with long-term linezolid use.",,,,2016-02-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The data concerning 6034 patients with advanced tuberculosis, mainly fibrocavernous tuberculosis of the lungs, were analysed. Four groups of the patients were randomized. In group 1 the management of the patients included etiotropic therapy and some treatment and rehabilitation measures with the use of Cycloferon. The group 2 patients in addition to the etiotropic therapy and some treatment and rehabilitation measures were given Omega-3. In group 3 the management included the etiotropic therapy and some treatment and rehabilitation measures. In group 4 the etioropic therapy was used alone. The analysis showed that 3419 patients had primary pulmonary tuberculosis, 340 patients had relapsing tuberculosis and 2275 patients had long-term process. The etiotropic therapy efficacy was estimated after an intensive phase of not more than 3 months. In the cases with Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance and some other unfavourable factors it was estimated after a 5-month intensive phase. The results confirmed that inclusion of immunomodulators to the treatment schemes allowed to increase the therapy efficacy and the patients' adherence to the treatment, as well as to shorten the period of the bacteria carriage. Thus, the use of Cycloferon in the schemes of the treatment of the patients with fibrocavernous pulmonary tuberculosis allowed to shorten the period of the pathogen carriage (as well as the drug resistant forms) in 94.1 ± 3.33% of the patients in spite of concomitant diseases. The effect of Cycloferon in such cases was likely due to both its direct immunoprotective action and the improvement of the general state of the patients and their higher adherence to the treatment.",,,,2016-02-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

There were a total of 178 cases, including 60 smear positive retreatment TB patients with DM and 118 without DM, who were randomly divided into 4 groups: Optimized group 1 [individualized treatment in 30 DM cases, 29 males, age (48 ± 11)], retreatment group 1 [standard retreatment regimen in 30 DM cases, 28 males, age(48 ± 10)], Optimized group 2[individual regimen in 57 non-DM cases, 37 males, age (41 ± 14)], and retreatment group 2 [standard retreatment regimen in 61 non-DM cases, 49 males, age (43 ± 13)]. Patients in the optimized group were treated with optimized individualized regimen based on DST result, with 3-4 sensitive drugs in the regimen, while those in the retreatment group were treated with national standard retreatment regimen. The therapeutic effect of different groups were recorded and the related factors of treatment outcome were analyzed with Chi-square test and multi-factor analysis.
The treatment success rates of the optimized group 1 and the retreatment group 1 were 83.3%(25/30) and 60.0%(18/30), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (χ(2)=4.02, P=0.045<0.05).

Drug development for TB, stymied for decades, has enjoyed a renaissance over the past several years. However, the development of new TB regimens is hindered by the limitations in our understanding and use of preclinical models; the paucity of accurate, early surrogate markers of cure, and challenges in untangling the individual contributions of drugs to multidrug regimens in a complex, multi-compartment disease. Lack of profit motive, advocacy, and imagination has contributed mightily to the dearth of drugs we have on the shelf to treat this ancient disease.

Although some augmentation procedures exist for obtaining counterfactual responses, they are specific to vaccine trials. We outline extensions to the existing augmentations and suggest augmentations of three trial designs outside the setting of vaccines. We outline the assumptions needed to identify the causal estimands of interest under each augmented design, under which standard likelihood-based methods can be used to evaluate intermediate responses as principal surrogates. Two of these designs, crossover and individual stepped-wedge, allow for the observation of clinical endpoints under both treatment and control for some subset of subjects and can therefore improve efficiency over standard parallel trial designs. The third, the treatment run-in design, allows for the observation of a baseline measure that may be as useful a surrogate as the true counterfactual intermediate response. As the evaluation methods rely on several assumptions, we also outline a remediation analysis, which can be used to help overcome assumption violations.

Early antituberculosis treatment and adjunctive treatment with glucocorticoids improve survival, but nearly one third of patients with the condition still die. We hypothesized that intensified antituberculosis treatment would enhance the killing of intracerebral Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms and decrease the rate of death among patients.
We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults and HIV-uninfected adults with a clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis who were admitted to one of two Vietnamese hospitals. We compared a standard, 9-month antituberculosis regimen (which included 10 mg of rifampin per kilogram of body weight per day) with an intensified regimen that included higher-dose rifampin (15 mg per kilogram per day) and levofloxacin (20 mg per kilogram per day) for the first 8 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was death by 9 months after randomization.
A total of 817 patients (349 of whom were HIV-infected) were enrolled; 409 were randomly assigned to receive the standard regimen, and 408 were assigned to receive intensified treatment. During the 9 months of follow-up, 113 patients in the intensified-treatment group and 114 patients in the standard-treatment group died (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.22; P=0.66).

We assessed the expected costs of the two MDR TB treatment approaches using a decision-analytic model with a follow-up of 6 months. MDR TB treatment outcomes were obtained from a systematic review of randomised clinical trials. The outcomes of interest included treatment success, treatment failure, treatment default and mortality and did not vary significantly between the two alternatives. Treatment costs included the cost of the following: drug therapy (F, H), hospital stay (F), nurse care (F, H), physician care (F), nursing facility (F) and transport to the healthcare provider (H). Finally, we estimated the potential cost savings associated with home-based treatment for all patients starting MDR TB treatment in Nigeria.
The average expected total treatment cost for a Nigerian patient treated for MDR TB was estimated at US2095 for facility - based care and 1535 for home-based care, a potential saving of 25%.

26576631,Synthetic investigational new drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis.,"Antitubercular agents, bedaquiline, delamanid, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, tuberculosis",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health concern. And while there are treatments already on the market, there is a demand for new drugs that are effective and safe against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which reduce the number of drugs and the duration of treatment in both drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).
This review covers promising novel investigational TB drugs that are currently under development. Specifically, the authors review the efficacy of novel agents for the treatment of TB in preclinical, phase I and phase II clinical trials. The authors also review the safety and tolerability profiles of these drugs.
Bedaquiline and delamanid are the most promising novel drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB, each having high efficacy and tolerability. However, the best regimen for achieving better outcomes and reducing adverse drug reactions remains to be determined, with safety concerns regarding cardiac events due to QT prolongation still to be addressed. Pretomanid is a novel drug that potentially shortens the duration of treatment in both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide. Linezolid shows marked efficacy in the treatment of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), but the drug is known to cause significant adverse drug reactions, including peripheral neuropathy, optic neuropathy and myelosuppression. These adverse reactions must be considered prior to prescribing long-term usage of this drug.",,,,2015-11-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) has improved the prognosis of HIV and reduced the risk of TB infected patients. Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) aims to reduce the development of active TB in patients with latent TB.
Systematically review and synthesize effect estimates of IPT for TB prevention in adult HIV patients. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of IPT on HIV disease progression, all-cause mortality and adverse drug reaction (ADR).
Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant articles in English available by September 11th 2015.
Research articles comparing IPT to placebo or no treatment in HIV infected adults using randomized clinical trials.
A qualitative review included study-level information on randomization and treatment allocation. Effect estimates were pooled using random-effects models to account for between-study heterogeneity.
This review assessed ten randomized clinical trials that assigned 7619 HIV patients to IPT or placebo. An overall 35% of TB risk reduction (RR = 0.65, 95% CI (0.51, 0.84)) was found in all participants, however, larger benefit of IPT was observed in Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) positive participants, with pooled relative risk reduction of 52% [RR = 0.48; 95% CI (0.29, 0.82)] and with a prediction interval ranging from 0.13 to 1.81. There was no statistically significant effect of IPT on TB occurrence in TST negative or unknown participants. IPT also reduced the risk of HIV disease progression in all participants (RR = 0.69; 95% CI (0.48, 0.99)) despite no benefits observed in TST strata. All-cause mortality was not affected by IPT although participants who had 12 months of IPT tend to have a reduced risk (RR = 0.65; 95% CI(0.47, 0.90)). IPT had an elevated, yet statistically non-significant, risk of adverse drug reaction [RR = 1.20; 95% CI (1.20, 1.71)]. Only a single study assessed the effect of IPT in combination with ART in preventing TB and occurrence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
IPT use substantially contributes in preventing TB in persons with HIV in general and in TST positive individuals in particular. More evidence is needed to explain discrepancies in the protective effect of IPT in these individuals.",,,,2015-11-10,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
26530386,Preclinical Evaluations To Identify Optimal Linezolid Regimens for Tuberculosis Therapy.,,mBio,"Linezolid is an oxazolidinone with potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Linezolid toxicity in patients correlates with the dose and duration of therapy. These toxicities are attributable to the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Clinically relevant linezolid regimens were simulated in the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) system to identify the linezolid therapies that minimize toxicity, maximize antibacterial activity, and prevent drug resistance. Linezolid inhibited mitochondrial proteins in an exposure-dependent manner, with toxicity being driven by trough concentrations. Once-daily linezolid killed M. tuberculosis in an exposure-dependent manner. Further, 300 mg linezolid given every 12 hours generated more bacterial kill but more toxicity than 600 mg linezolid given once daily. None of the regimens prevented linezolid resistance. These findings show that with linezolid monotherapy, a clear tradeoff exists between antibacterial activity and toxicity. By identifying the pharmacokinetic parameters linked with toxicity and antibacterial activity, these data can provide guidance for clinical trials evaluating linezolid in multidrug antituberculosis regimens.
The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis are a major threat to global public health. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone that is licensed for human use and has demonstrated potent activity against multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. However, long-term use of linezolid has shown to be toxic in patients, often resulting in thrombocytopenia. We examined therapeutic linezolid regimens in an in vitro model to characterize the exposure-toxicity relationship. The antibacterial activity against M. tuberculosis was also assessed for these regimens, including the amplification or suppression of resistant mutant subpopulations by the chosen regimen. Higher exposures of linezolid resulted in greater antibacterial activity, but with more toxicity and, for some regimens, increased resistant mutant subpopulation amplification, illustrating the trade-off between activity and toxicity. These findings can provide valuable insight for designing optimal dosage regimens for linezolid that are part of the long combination courses used to treat multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.",,,,2015-11-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) regimen consists of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and correct management reduces risk of TB relapse and development of drug resistance. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of standard of care plus nutritional supplementation versus standard care on the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol among sputum smear positive TB patients with and without HIV. In a clinical trial in 100 Tanzanian TB patients, with or without HIV infection, drug concentrations were determined at 1 week and 2 months post initiation of anti-TB medication. Data was analysed using population pharmacokinetic modelling. The effect of body size was described using allometric scaling, and the effects of nutritional supplementation, HIV, age, sex, CD4+ count, weight-adjusted dose, NAT2 genotype, and time on TB treatment were investigated. The kinetics of all drugs was well characterised using first-order elimination and transit compartment absorption, with isoniazid and ethambutol described by two-compartment disposition models, and pyrazinamide by a one-compartment model. Patients with a slow NAT2 genotype had higher isoniazid exposure and a lower estimate of oral clearance (15.5 L/h) than rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype (26.1 L/h). Pyrazinamide clearance had an estimated typical value of 3.32 L/h, and it was found to increase with time on treatment, with a 16.3% increase after the first 2 months of anti-TB treatment. The typical clearance of ethambutol was estimated to be 40.7 L/h, and was found to decrease with age, at a rate of 1.41% per year.

Research from the cardiopulmonary laboratory of the Chest Service by Drs. Cournand and Richards resulted in the shared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1956 for the development of human cardiac catheterization. In more recent years, continuing its mission to serve the underserved and respond to health crises, the Bellevue Chest Service has served as a leader in the management of HIV infections, multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemics, early detection of lung cancer, and management of urban asthma. Members of the Chest Service founded the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center shortly after collapse of the towers in 2001. The Chest Service became New York's infectious isolation unit caring for the first patient in New York infected with Ebola virus. Recent research has focused on disease management, with the first in-house Directly Observed Therapy Clinic for treatment of tuberculosis, clinical trials of aerosolized IFN-γ, and translational research on host defense against tuberculosis infection. Studies of the airway mucosa have revealed mechanisms by which ambient pollutants promote asthma. Studies on the World Trade Center firefighters and community populations have promoted understanding of systemic inflammation and small airways function.

Individuals with tuberculosis disease commonly exhibit vitamin D deficiency, which may adversely affect immunity and the response to therapy.
We determined whether adjunctive high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation improves outcomes in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease.
The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, intent-to-treat trial in 199 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis disease in Tbilisi, Georgia. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive oral vitamin D3 [50,000 IUs (1.25 mg) thrice weekly for 8 wk and 50,000 IU every other week for 8 wk] or a placebo concomitant with standard first-line antituberculosis drugs. The primary outcome was the time for the conversion of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) sputum culture to negative.
Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Most subjects (74%) were vitamin D deficient (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration <50 nmol/L). With vitamin D3, plasma 25(OH)D concentrations peaked at ∼250 nmol/L by 8 wk and decreased to ∼125 nmol/L at week 16. Adverse events and plasma calcium concentrations were similar between groups.

26343800,The association between sterilizing activity and drug distribution into tuberculosis lesions.,,Nature medicine,"Finding new treatment-shortening antibiotics to improve cure rates and curb the alarming emergence of drug resistance is the major objective of tuberculosis (TB) drug development. Using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging suite in a biosafety containment facility, we show that the key sterilizing drugs rifampicin and pyrazinamide efficiently penetrate the sites of TB infection in lung lesions. Rifampicin even accumulates in necrotic caseum, a critical lesion site where persisting tubercle bacilli reside. In contrast, moxifloxacin, which is active in vitro against a subpopulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that persists in specific niches under drug pressure and has achieved treatment shortening in mice, does not diffuse well in caseum, concordant with its failure to shorten therapy in recent clinical trials. We suggest that such differential spatial distribution and kinetics of accumulation in lesions may create temporal and spatial windows of monotherapy in specific niches, allowing the gradual development of multidrug-resistant TB. We propose an alternative working model to prioritize new antibiotic regimens based on quantitative and spatial distribution of TB drugs in the major lesion types found in human lungs. The finding that lesion penetration may contribute to treatment outcome has wide implications for TB.",,,,2015-09-08,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Current therapies available to combat TB include chemotherapy and the preventative vaccine Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette et Guérin (BCG). Increased reporting of drug resistant M.tb strains worldwide indicates that drug development cannot be the primary mechanism for eradication. BCG vaccination has been used globally for protection against childhood and disseminated TB, however, its efficacy at protecting against pulmonary TB in adult and aging populations is highly variable. In this regard, the immune response generated by BCG vaccination is incapable of sterilizing the lung post M.tb infection as indicated by the large proportion of individuals with latent TB infection that have received BCG. Although many new TB vaccine candidates have entered the development pipeline, only a few have moved to human clinical trials; where they showed no efficacy and/or were withdrawn due to safety regulations.

Poor adherence to a long therapeutic regimen against TB, intermittent drug use, errors in medical prescriptions, low quality of old TB drugs and ineffective TB control have led to the emergence of resistant TB.
Two new drugs have gained importance and seem promising against resistant TB: bedaquiline and delamanid. This review summarizes the main characteristics of these two drugs and their role in TB management.
Bedaquiline and delamanid appear to be promising new anti-TB drugs. Due to a mechanism of action that is different from that of other available drugs, their efficacy has appeared optimal in cases of adults with resistant pulmonary TB. Although their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles seem optimal, potential cardiologic side effects such as QT-interval prolongation have been associated with their use. However, specific studies performed in the pediatric population are needed to confirm these results.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of early initiation of ART (within 2-4 weeks of TB treatment) on several treatment outcomes among TB/HIV-coinfected patients.
A systematic search of clinical trials was performed in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Medscape, and the Cochrane library. Clinical trials which were published in any language before the last date of search (March 31, 2015) were included. The qualities of the studies were assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Library. Heterogeneity test was conducted to assess the variations among study outcomes. For each study outcome, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as a measure of intervention effect. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to estimate the RR using a fixed-effects model.
A total of 2272 study participants from 6 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Early ART initiation during TB treatment was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.63-0.98) and increased rate of TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS; RR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.77- 2.70) and death related to TB-IRIS (RR = 6.94; 95% CI = 1.26-38.22). However, the time of ART initiation has no association with TB cure rate (RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.81-1.07), rate of drug toxicity (RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.93-1.08), death associated with drug toxicity (RR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.14- 1.16), rate of low viral load (less than 400 copies/mL; RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.96-1.04), and rate of new AIDS-defining illness (RR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.60-1.18). Immunological response in early ART arms of study participant in different trials showed a greater or equal response compared with late ART arms.
This systematic review presents conclusive evidence on the reduction of all-cause mortality as a result of early initiation of ART.

Global health,"In South Africa, sputum smear microscopy has been replaced with Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis. In a pragmatic parallel cluster-randomised trial, we evaluated the effect on patient and programme outcomes.
We randomly allocated 20 laboratories (clusters) in medium-burden districts of South Africa to either an Xpert (immediate Xpert) or microscopy (Xpert deferred) group (1:1), stratified by province. At two primary care clinics per laboratory, a systematic sample of adults giving sputum for tuberculosis investigation was assessed for eligibility. The primary outcome was mortality at 6 months from enrolment. Masking of participants' group allocation was not possible because of the pragmatic trial design. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN68905568) and the South African Clinical Trial Register (DOH-27-1011-3849).
Between June and November, 2012, 4972 people were screened, and 4656 (93·6%) enrolled (median age 36 years; 2891 [62%] female; 2212 [62%] reported being HIV-positive). There was no difference between the Xpert and microscopy groups with respect to mortality at 6 months (91/2324 [3·9%] vs 116/2332 [5·0%], respectively; adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 1·10, 95% CI 0·75-1·62]).
Xpert did not reduce mortality at 6 months compared with sputum microscopy. Improving outcomes in drug-sensitive tuberculosis programmes might require not only better diagnostic tests but also better linkage to care.

26170507,The need to accelerate access to new drugs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"Approximately half a million people are thought to develop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis annually. Barely 20% of these people currently receive recommended treatment and only about 10% are successfully treated. Poor access to treatment is probably driving the current epidemic, via ongoing transmission. Treatment scale-up is hampered by current treatment regimens, which are lengthy, expensive, poorly tolerated and difficult to administer in the settings where most patients reside. Although new drugs provide an opportunity to improve treatment regimens, current and planned clinical trials hold little promise for developing regimens that will facilitate prompt treatment scale-up. In this article we argue that clinical trials, while necessary, should be complemented by timely, large-scale, operational research that will provide programmatic data on the use of new drugs and regimens while simultaneously improving access to life-saving treatment. Perceived risks - such as the rapid development of resistance to new drugs - need to be balanced against the high levels of mortality and transmission that will otherwise persist. Doubling access to treatment and increasing treatment success could save approximately a million lives over the next decade.
On estime à un demi-million le nombre de personnes qui contractent chaque année la tuberculose multirésistante. De nos jours, à peine 20% d'entre elles reçoivent le traitement recommandé, et seulement 10% environ sont traitées avec succès. L'accès limité au traitement est probablement responsable de l'épidémie actuelle qui se propage par une transmission continue. L'amélioration de l'accès au traitement est freinée par les schémas thérapeutiques actuels, lesquels sont très longs, chers, mal tolérés et difficiles à gérer dans les régions où résident la plupart des patients. Bien que de nouveaux médicaments permettent d'améliorer les schémas thérapeutiques, les essais cliniques actuels et prévus ne laissent que peu d'espoir quant au développement de schémas qui favoriseraient l'amélioration rapide de l'accès au traitement. Dans cet article, nous soutenons que les essais cliniques sont certes nécessaires, mais qu'ils doivent être accompagnés d'une recherche opérationnelle de grande ampleur effectuée en temps voulu. Cette recherche permettrait d'obtenir des données programmatiques sur l'utilisation des nouveaux médicaments et schémas tout en améliorant l'accès à un traitement pouvant sauver des vies. Les risques perçus – tels que le développement rapide d'une résistance aux nouveaux médicaments – doivent être mis en balance avec les taux élevés de mortalité et de transmission qui se maintiendraient sans cela. Doubler l'accès au traitement et accroître son efficacité permettrait de sauver environ un million de vies au cours de la décennie à venir.
Se estima que alrededor de 500.000 personas al año desarrollan tuberculosis multirresistente. Apenas el 20% de estas personas recibe un tratamiento recomendado y solo el 10% se somete a un tratamiento eficaz. Probablemente la epidemia actual, a través de la transmisión continua, se deba al escaso acceso al tratamiento. La ampliación del tratamiento se ve obstaculizada por los regímenes terapéuticos actuales, que son prolongados, caros, producen intolerancia y son complicados de administrar en los lugares donde residen los pacientes. A pesar de que los nuevos fármacos son una oportunidad de mejorar los regímenes terapéuticos, los ensayos clínicos actuales y planificados no ofrecen demasiadas esperanzas para desarrollar regímenes que faciliten una ampliación del tratamiento a corto plazo. En este artículo sostenemos que los ensayos clínicos, mientras sea necesario, deberían ir acompañados de una investigación operativa oportuna a gran escala que proporcione información programática sobre el uso de los nuevos fármacos y regímenes, mientras mejora el acceso a un tratamiento que salvará vidas. Los riesgos, como el rápido desarrollo de la resistencia a nuevos fármacos, deberían equilibrarse frente a los altos niveles de mortalidad y transmisión que, de otro modo, continuarán existiendo. Duplicar el acceso al tratamiento y aumentar su éxito podría salvar alrededor de un millón de vidas en la próxima década.

每年大约有五十万人被认为患上了多重抗药性结核病。 其中仅有 20% 的人目前接受推荐的治疗方案，而大约只有 10% 的人成功治愈。 治疗不佳便会导致持续性传播，这可能是当前传染病加剧的原因。 治疗范围的扩大受限于当前的治疗方案，该种方案不仅冗长、昂贵、耐受性差，并且很难在多数患者居住的环境中予以实施。 虽然新药让我们有机会改善治疗方案，但是当前和计划的临床试验仍无法保证制定出有助于迅速扩大治疗范围的方案。 在本文中，我们主张临床试验应通过开展及时的、大规模性的操作型研究加以实施，而该种研究须能针对新药和方案的使用提供程式化数据，从而同时改善救生治疗的情况。 感知风险——如新药的抗药性快速产生——需要在高水平的死亡率和传播率之间寻求平衡，否则其将持续存在。 获得加倍治疗并提高治疗成功率，可在未来十年中挽救大约一百万人的生命。.
Считается, что ежегодно туберкулезом с множественной лекарственной устойчивостью заболевает около полумиллиона человек. Из этих пациентов только 20% в настоящее время получают рекомендованное лечение, а успешно вылечиваются лишь около 10%. Недостаточный доступ к лечению является вероятной причиной нынешней эпидемии, которая продолжает распространяться. Расширению масштабов лечения препятствуют существующие схемы лечения, которые являются продолжительными, дорогостоящими, плохо переносятся больными и которые трудно проводить в местах проживания большинства пациентов. Несмотря на то что в настоящее время планируются или уже проводятся испытания новых лекарственных препаратов, способных усовершенствовать схемы лечения, эти испытания вряд ли позволят сделать лечение более своевременным в широких масштабах. В данной статье мы приводим доводы в пользу того, что клинические испытания (безусловно, необходимые) должны сопровождаться своевременными, крупномасштабными, операционными исследованиями для получения программных данных о применении новых лекарственных препаратов и лечебных курсов, а также улучшения доступа к жизненно необходимому лечению. Предполагаемые риски, например стремительное развитие устойчивости к новым препаратам, необходимо соотносить с высоким уровнем заболеваемости и смертности, который в противном случае будет сохраняться. Если в следующем десятилетии лечение станет в два раза доступнее и его эффективность будет повышена, потенциально удастся спасти около одного миллиона жизней.",,,,2015-07-15,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Drug resistance arises due to non-compliance of antibiotic therapy. Herein, we explored the therapeutic options available ranging from conservative treatment approaches to alternate adjunct therapies such as mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy interventions. It is attractive to understand the scientific rationale of using cells as drugs, in particular mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. The review dwells and attempts to analyze the mechanistic approaches of the current treatment modalities to modern therapies. MSCs have demonstrated profound capacity to regenerate and repair. They appear to modulate that the activities of dendritic cells regulate T cells, both in vivo and in vitro. While there seems to be some benefit of such therapies, its use warrants further research. The merits and de-merits of autologous therapy/allogeneic therapy are ill understood. The challenges of requirement of large number of cells for infusion, the route of administration, choice of timing are complex issues that need to be addressed. Furthermore, the host immune responses, environmental factors and epigenetic mechanisms compound the problem. Although, clinical studies are being performed using autologous MSCs in different inflammatory models, it is important that such an intervention should be based on sound scientific rationale. The current review examines the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, its interactions with other cell types, in assessing the basis for autologous/allogeneic cell-based therapies in the treatment of XDR/MDR tuberculosis.",,,,2015-06-24,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
26093675,People-centered tuberculosis care versus standard directly observed therapy: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,,Trials,"Tuberculosis is a major public health concern resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Tuberculosis requires a long and intensive course of treatment. Thus, various approaches, including patient empowerment, education and counselling sessions, and involvement of family members and community workers, have been suggested for improving treatment adherence and outcome. The current randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness over usual care of an innovative multicomponent people-centered tuberculosis-care strategy in Armenia.
Innovative Approach to Tuberculosis care in Armenia is an open-label, stratified cluster randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Tuberculosis outpatient centers are the clusters assigned to intervention and control arms. Drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients in the continuation phase of treatment in the intervention arm and their family members participate in a short educational and counselling session to raise their knowledge, decrease tuberculosis-related stigma, and enhance treatment adherence. Patients receive the required medications for one week during the weekly visits to the tuberculosis outpatient centers. Additionally, patients receive daily Short Message Service (SMS) reminders to take their medications and daily phone calls to assure adherence and monitoring of treatment potential side effects. Control-arm patients follow the World Health Organization--recommended directly observed treatment strategy, including daily visits to tuberculosis outpatient centers for drug-intake. The primary outcome is physician-reported treatment outcome. Patients' knowledge, depression, quality of life, within-family tuberculosis-related stigma, family social support, and self-reported adherence to tuberculosis treatment are secondary outcomes.
Improved adherence and tuberculosis treatment outcomes can strengthen tuberculosis control and thereby forestall tuberculosis and multidrug resistant tuberculosis epidemics. Positive findings on effectiveness of this innovative tuberculosis treatment people-centered approach will support its adoption in countries with similar healthcare and economic profiles.

26073420,Exploring the potential of adjunct therapy in tuberculosis.,"efflux pump, host-directed adjunct therapies, repurposed drugs, virulence factors",Trends in pharmacological sciences,"A critical unmet need for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is to find novel therapies that are efficacious, safe, and shorten the duration of treatment. Drug discovery approaches for TB primarily target essential genes of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) but novel strategies such as host-directed therapies and nonmicrobicidal targets are necessary to bring about a paradigm shift in treatment. Drugs targeting the host pathways and nonmicrobicidal proteins can be used only in conjunction with existing drugs as adjunct therapies. Significantly, host-directed adjunct therapies have the potential to decrease duration of treatment, as they are less prone to drug resistance, target the immune responses, and act via novel mechanism of action. Recent advances in targeting host-pathogen interactions have implicated pathways such as eicosanoid regulation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, several approved drugs such as metformin and verapamil have been identified that appear suitable for repurposing for the treatment of TB. These findings and the challenges in the area of host- and/or pathogen-directed adjunct therapies and their implications for TB therapy are discussed.",,,,2015-06-16,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Among the total 359 MTBC strains that were analyzed in this study, 22.8% were resistant to at least one of the first line anti-tuberculosis drugs, including 2.5% multidrug resistance and 17.5% isoniazid resistance, with or without other drugs. In addition, further characterization of isolates from a subset of the two trials (n = 184) revealed a total of 80 different spoligotype patterns, 29 ""orphan"" and 51 shared patterns. We identified the six major MTBC lineages of human relevance, with predominance of the Euro-American lineage. In total, 132 (71.7%) of the strains were genotypically clustered, and further analysis (using the DESTUS model) suggesting significantly faster spread of LAM10_CAM family (p = 0.00016).

Some activists have also campaigned for bedaquiline to be approved by regulatory authorities before testing of the drug is completed.

Available treatments for paediatric drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis, albeit generally effective, are hampered by high pill burden, long duration of treatment, coexistent toxic effects, and an overall scarcity of suitable child-friendly formulations. Several new drugs and regimens with promising activity against both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains have entered clinical development and are either in various phases of clinical investigation or have received marketing authorisation for adults; however, none have data on their use in children. This consensus statement, generated from an international panel of opinion leaders on childhood tuberculosis and incorporating reviews of published literature from January, 2004, to May, 2014, addressed four key questions: what drugs or regimens should be prioritised for clinical trials in children? Which populations of children are high priorities for study? When can phase 1 or 2 studies be initiated in children? What are the relevant elements of clinical trial design? The consensus panel found that children can be included in studies at the early phases of drug development and should be an integral part of the clinical development plan, rather than studied after regulatory approval in adults is obtained.",,,,2015-05-11,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Pivotal Phase III trials are large, lengthy and expensive, and the funding and capacity to conduct them are limited worldwide. More rational methods for the selection of priority regimens for Phase III are urgently needed to avoid costly late-stage failures. We examine the suitability of adaptive clinical trial designs for drug development in TB, focusing on designs for Phase IIB and III trials, where we believe the biggest gains in efficiency can be made. Key areas that may be addressed by such designs are improvements in the selection of doses and combinations of drugs in early clinical development and in maximising the power of confirmatory trials in multidrug-resistant TB, where patient numbers and complexity pose practical limitations. We encourage trialists and regulators in this area to consider the advantages that may be offered by these designs and their potential to more effectively and rapidly identify better treatment regimens for TB patients worldwide.",,,,2015-05-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We here report treatment outcomes in a step-wedged cluster randomized trial for patients diagnosed with XpertMTB/RIF compared to patients diagnosed with sputum smear examination in public health facilities in Brazil.
Treatment outcome data were added to the trial database of patients diagnosed from 4 February to 4 October 2012, and crosschecked with data from the national mortality and the drug-resistant TB registers. Treatment outcomes in the intervention (n=2232) and baseline (n=1856) arms were compared using a multilevel regression model.
Unfavourable outcomes were frequent in both arms, mainly due to loss to follow-up (16%). Overall unfavourable outcomes were not reduced in the intervention arm (29.6% versus 31.7%, OR=0.93; 95%CI=0.79-1.08). However, the overall TB-attributed death rate was lower in the intervention arm (2.3% vs. 3.8%). Adjusted for HIV status, age group and city, the intervention resulted in a 35% decrease in TB-attributed deaths (OR=0.65, 95%CI=0.44-0.97).
The proportion of patients successfully treated did not increase with Xpert MTB/RIF implementation, with high loss to follow-up rates in both arms. We did observe a 35% reduction in TB-related mortality, which we hypothesize may be explained by less advanced disease among the smear-negative patients diagnosed by Xpert.

The incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a cohort of MDR-TB patients, 38-years old on average, with Deltyba™ plus BR versus a five drug- BR regimen alone was compared in a Markov model over a period of 10 years. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were determined from a societal perspective. Recent data from a German cost calculation on MDR-TB were applied to the 24-month outcome results of patients participating in the placebo-controlled, phase II Otsuka's Trial 204. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% and subjected to deterministic as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis in a Monte Carlo simulation.
Based on the current market prices the total discounted cost per patient on BR plus Deltyba™ was €142,732 compared to €150,909 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per patient were 8.47 for Deltyba™ versus 6.13 for BR alone. Accordingly, the addition of Deltyba™ proved to be dominant over the BR alone-strategy by simultaneously saving €8177 and gaining 2.34 QALYs. Deltyba™ was cost saving in 73% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses compared to BR alone and 100% cost effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €10,000.
Under conditions prevalent in Germany, Deltyba™ added to a five drug BR regimen is likely to be cost-saving compared to BR alone under a wide range of assumptions. Adding delamanid remained cost-effective when costs due to loss of productivity were excluded as the QALYs gained by lower lethality and a higher proportion of successfully treated patients outweighed the delamanid drug costs.

The studies to date have chosen a number of different comparator populations, and in many TB endemic areas there is a lack of normative data regarding the health status of the general population. Systematic evaluations of quality of life are urgently needed in specific groups, including those with extrapulmonary TB, drug-resistant disease, HIV co-infection, and latent TB infection, and in children with TB; the assessment of post-treatment disability is also required.",,,,2015-03-27,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Following on from favourable assessment in a 2 week study, we investigated a novel regimen for efficacy and safety in drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis during the first 8 weeks of treatment.
We did this phase 2b study of bactericidal activity--defined as the decrease in colony forming units (CFUs) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum of patients with microscopy smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis-at eight sites in South Africa and Tanzania. We enrolled treatment-naive patients with drug-susceptible, pulmonary tuberculosis, who were randomly assigned by computer-generated sequences to receive either 8 weeks of moxifloxacin, 100 mg pretomanid (formerly known as PA-824), and pyrazinamide (MPa100Z regimen); moxifloxacin, 200 mg pretomanid, and pyrazinamide (MPa200Z regimen); or the current standard care for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis, isoniazid, rifampicin, PZA, and ethambutol (HRZE regimen). A group of patients with MDR tuberculosis received MPa200Z (DRMPa200Z group). The primary outcome was bactericidal activity measured by the mean daily rate of reduction in M tuberculosis CFUs per mL overnight sputum collected once a week, with joint Bayesian non-linear mixed-effects regression modelling. We also assessed safety and tolerability by monitoring adverse events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01498419.
Between March 24, 2012, and July 26, 2013 we enrolled 207 patients and randomly assigned them to treatment groups; we assigned 60 patients to the MPa100Z regimen, 62 to the MPa200Z regimen, and 59 to the HRZE regimen. We non-randomly assigned 26 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis to the DRMPa200Z regimen. In patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the bactericidal activity of MPa200Z (n=54) on days 0-56 (0·155, 95% Bayesian credibility interval 0·133-0·178) was significantly greater than for HRZE (n=54, 0·112, 0·093-0·131). DRMPa200Z (n=9) had bactericidal activity of 0·117 (0·070-0·174). The bactericidal activity on days 7-14 was strongly associated with bactericidal activity on days 7-56. Frequencies of adverse events were similar to standard treatment in all groups. The most common adverse event was hyperuricaemia in 59 (29%) patients (17 [28%] patients in MPa100Z group, 17 [27%] patients in MPa200Z group, 17 [29%] patients. in HRZE group, and 8 [31%] patients in DRMPa200Z group). Other common adverse events were nausea in (14 [23%] patients in MPa100Z group, 8 [13%] patients in MPa200Z group, 7 [12%] patients in HRZE group, and 8 [31%] patients in DRMPa200Z group) and vomiting (7 [12%] patients in MPa100Z group, 7 [11%] patients in MPa200Z group, 7 [12%] patients in HRZE group, and 4 [15%] patients in DRMPa200Z group). No on-treatment electrocardiogram occurrences of corrected QT interval more than 500 ms (an indicator of potential of ventricular tachyarrhythmia) were reported. No phenotypic resistance developed to any of the drugs in the regimen.
The combination of moxifloxacin, pretomanid, and pyrazinamide, was safe, well tolerated, and showed superior bactericidal activity in drug-susceptible tuberculosis during 8 weeks of treatment. Results were consistent between drug-susceptible and MDR tuberculosis. This new regimen is ready to enter phase 3 trials in patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis and MDR-tuberculosis, with the goal of shortening and simplifying treatment.

Patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) undergoing adjunctive surgery were enrolled in Tbilisi, Georgia. Serum was obtained at 0, 1, 4, and 8 h and at the time of cavitary removal to measure levofloxacin concentrations. After surgery, microdialysis was performed using the ex vivo cavity, and levofloxacin concentrations in the collected dialysate fluid were measured. Noncompartmental analysis was performed, and a cavitary-to-serum levofloxacin concentration ratio was calculated. Twelve patients received levofloxacin for a median of 373 days before surgery (median dose, 11.8 mg/kg). The median levofloxacin concentration in serum (Cmax) was 6.5 μg/ml, and it was <2 μg/ml in 3 (25%) patients. Among 11 patients with complete data, the median cavitary concentration of levofloxacin was 4.36 μg/ml (range, 0.46 to 8.82).

However, what this standard rhetoric overlooks is the complexity of TB chemotherapy, and the relationship between this and two other ways of treating the disease, bed rest and thoracic surgery. During the late 1940s and 1950s, these three treatment strands overlapped one another, and determining best practice from a plethora of prescribing choices was a difficult task. This article focuses on the clinical decision-making underpinning the evolution of successful treatment for TB using drugs alone. Fears over the risk of streptomycin-resistant organisms entering the community meant that, initially, the clinical application of streptomycin was limited. Combining it with other drugs lessened this risk, but even so the potential of chemotherapy as a curative option for TB was not immediately apparent. The MRC ran a series of clinical trials in the post-war period but not all of their recommendations were adopted by clinicians in the field. Rather, a range of different determinants, including the timing of trials, the time taken for results to emerge, and whether these results 'fitted' with individual experience all influenced the translation of trial results into clinical practice.",,,,2015-03-15,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Infectious diseases,"Patients with subclinical tuberculosis, smear-negative tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and asymptomatic tuberculosis are difficult to diagnose and may be missed at all points of health care. We did an autopsy study to ascertain the burden of tuberculosis at post mortem in medical inpatients at a tertiary care hospital in Lusaka, Zambia.
Between April 5, 2012, and May 22, 2013, we did whole-body autopsies on inpatients aged at least 16 years who died in the adult inpatient wards at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia. We did gross pathological and histopathological analysis and processed lung tissues from patients with tuberculosis through the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay to identify patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The primary outcome measure was specific disease or diseases stratified by HIV status. Secondary outcomes were missed tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and comorbidities with tuberculosis. Data were analysed using Pearson χ(2), the Mann-Whitney U test, and binary logistic regression.
The median age of the 125 included patients was 35 years (IQR 29-43), 80 (64%) were men, and 101 (81%) were HIV positive. 78 (62%) patients had tuberculosis, of whom 66 (85%) were infected with HIV. 35 (45%) of these 78 patients had extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The risk of extrapulmonary tuberculosis was higher among HIV-infected patients than among uninfected patients (adjusted odds ratio 5·14, 95% CI 1·04-24·5; p=0·045). 20 (26%) of 78 patients with tuberculosis were not diagnosed during their life and 13 (17%) had undiagnosed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Common comorbidities with tuberculosis were pyogenic pneumonia in 26 patients (33%) and anaemia in 15 (19%).
Increased clinical awareness and more proactive screening for tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in inpatient settings is needed. Further autopsy studies are needed to ascertain the generalisability of the findings.

To evaluate macronutrient intake and body composition in individuals with newly diagnosed TB over time.
Adults with active pulmonary TB (n = 191; 23 with multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and 36 culture-negative household contacts (controls) enrolled in a clinical trial of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) were studied. Macronutrient intake was determined at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. Serial body composition was assessed by body mass index (BMI; kg/m(2)) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to estimate fat mass and fat-free mass. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA for changes over time and linear regression were used.
At baseline, mean daily energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate (CHO) intakes were significantly higher, and body weight, BMI, fat-free mass and fat mass were significantly lower, between TB subjects and controls.

High doses of vitamin D were widely used to treat TB during the pre-antibiotic era. Vitamin D exerts its action through vitamin D receptor (VDR), and VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility or resistance to tuberculosis as well as sputum smear and culture conversion during anti-TB treatment. In-vitro studies have revealed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhances innate immunity by increased expression of various antimicrobial peptides, including cathelicidin, and induction of autophagy of the infected cells thus restricts the intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages. On the other hand, vitamin D has been shown to suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokine response and enhance the anti-inflammatory response. Supplementation with vitamin D in concert with treatment for TB may be beneficial with respect to minimizing the excessive tissue damage that occurs during the active stage of tuberculosis disease. Several clinical trials have evaluated vitamin D supplementation as an adjunct therapy in the treatment for tuberculosis. However, results are conflicting, owing to variations in dose regimens and outcomes. Further investigations are needed to find the optimal concentration of vitamin D for supplementation with standard anti-TB drugs to optimize treatment, which could help to effectively manage both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis.",,,,2015-03-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
25734143,Drivers and trajectories of resistance to new first-line drug regimens for tuberculosis.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, TB drug regimens, TB drug resistance, TB mathematical model",Open forum infectious diseases,"New first-line drug regimens for treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are in clinical trials: emergence of resistance is a key concern. Because population-level data on resistance cannot be collected in advance, epidemiological models are important tools for understanding the drivers and dynamics of resistance before novel drug regimens are launched.
We developed a transmission model of TB after launch of a new drug regimen, defining drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) as resistance to the new regimen. The model is characterized by (1) the probability of acquiring resistance during treatment, (2) the transmission fitness of DR-TB relative to drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), and (3) the probability of treatment success for DR-TB versus DS-TB. We evaluate the effect of each factor on future DR-TB prevalence, defined as the proportion of incident TB that is drug-resistant.
Probability of acquired resistance was the strongest predictor of the DR-TB proportion in the first 5 years after the launch of a new drug regimen. Over a longer term, however, the DR-TB proportion was driven by the resistant population's transmission fitness and treatment success rates. Regardless of uncertainty in acquisition probability and transmission fitness, high levels (>10%) of drug resistance were unlikely to emerge within 50 years if, among all cases of TB that were detected, 85% of those with DR-TB could be appropriately diagnosed as such and then successfully treated.

25726085,Sputum culture conversion as a prognostic marker for end-of-treatment outcome in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a secondary analysis of data from two observational cohort studies.,,The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,"Sputum culture conversion is often used as an early microbiological endpoint in phase 2 clinical trials of tuberculosis treatment on the basis of its assumed predictive value for end-of-treatment outcome, particularly in patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis. We aimed to assess the validity of sputum culture conversion on solid media at varying timepoints, and the time to conversion, as prognostic markers for end-of-treatment outcome in patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis.
We analysed data from two large cohort studies of patients with MDR tuberculosis. We defined sputum culture conversion as two or more consecutive negative cultures from sputum samples obtained at least 30 days apart. To estimate the association of 2 month and 6 month conversion with successful treatment outcome, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs with random-effects multivariable logistic regression. We calculated predictive values with bivariate random-effects generalised linear mixed modelling.
We assessed data for 1712 patients who had treatment success, treatment failure, or who died. Among patients with treatment success, median time to sputum culture conversion was significantly shorter than in those who had poor outcomes (2 months [IQR 1-3] vs 7 months [3 to ≥24]; log-rank p<0·0001). Furthermore, conversion status at 6 months (adjusted OR 14·07 [95% CI 10·05-19·71]) was significantly associated with treatment success compared with failure or death. Sputum culture conversion status at 2 months was significantly associated with treatment success only in patients who were HIV negative (adjusted OR 4·12 [95% CI 2·25-7·54]) or who had unknown HIV infection (3·59 [1·96-6·58]), but not in those who were HIV positive (0·38 [0·12-1·18]). Thus, the overall association of sputum culture conversion with a successful outcome was substantially greater at 6 months than at 2 months. 2 month conversion had low sensitivity (27·3% [95% confidence limit 16·6-41·4]) and high specificity (89·8% [82·3-94·4]) for prediction of treatment success. Conversely, 6 month sputum culture conversion status had high sensitivity (91·8% [85·9-95·4]), but moderate specificity (57·8% [42·5-71·6]). The maximum combined sensitivity and specificity for sputum culture conversion was reached between month 6 and month 10 of treatment.
Time to sputum culture conversion, conversion status at 6 months, and conversion status at 2 months in patients without known HIV infection can be considered as proxy markers of end-of-treatment outcome in patients with MDR tuberculosis, although the overall association with treatment success is substantially stronger for 6 month than for 2 month conversion status. Investigators should consider these results regarding the validity of sputum culture conversion at various timepoints as an early predictor of treatment efficacy when designing phase 2 studies before investing substantial resources in large, long-term, phase 3 trials of new treatments for MDR tuberculosis.

SQ109 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the trypomastigote form of the parasite, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for cell killing of 50 ± 8 nM, but it had little effect (50% effective concentration [EC50], ∼80 μM) in a red blood cell hemolysis assay. It also inhibited extracellular epimastigotes (IC50, 4.6 ± 1 μM) and the clinically relevant intracellular amastigotes (IC50, ∼0.5 to 1 μM), with a selectivity index of ∼10 to 20. SQ109 caused major ultrastructural changes in all three life cycle forms, as observed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It rapidly collapsed the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in succinate-energized mitochondria, acting in the same manner as the uncoupler FCCP [carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone], and it caused the alkalinization of internal acidic compartments, effects that are likely to make major contributions to its mechanism of action. The compound also had activity against squalene synthase, binding to its active site; it inhibited sterol side-chain reduction and, in the amastigote assay, acted synergistically with the antifungal drug posaconazole, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.48, but these effects are unlikely to account for the rapid effects seen on cell morphology and cell killing. SQ109 thus most likely acts, at least in part, by collapsing Δψ/ΔpH, one of the major mechanisms demonstrated previously for its action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Overall, the results suggest that SQ109, which is currently in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis, may also have potential as a drug lead against Chagas disease.",,,,2015-01-15,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

25490549,Impact of replacing smear microscopy with Xpert MTB/RIF for diagnosing tuberculosis in Brazil: a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial.,,PLoS medicine,"Abundant evidence on Xpert MTB/RIF accuracy for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance has been produced, yet there are few data on the population benefit of its programmatic use. We assessed whether the implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF in routine conditions would (1) increase the notification rate of laboratory-confirmed pulmonary TB to the national notification system and (2) reduce the time to TB treatment initiation (primary endpoints).
We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial from 4 February to 4 October 2012 in 14 primary care laboratories in two Brazilian cities. Diagnostic specimens were included for 11,705 baseline (smear microscopy) and 12,522 intervention (Xpert MTB/RIF) patients presumed to have TB. Single-sputum-sample Xpert MTB/RIF replaced two-sputum-sample smear microscopy for routine diagnosis of pulmonary TB. In total, 1,137 (9.7%) tests in the baseline arm and 1,777 (14.2%) in the intervention arm were positive (p<0.001), resulting in an increased bacteriologically confirmed notification rate of 59% (95% CI = 31%, 88%). However, the overall notification rate did not increase (15%, 95% CI =  -6%, 37%), and we observed no change in the notification rate for those without a test result (-3%, 95% CI = -37%, 30%). Median time to treatment decreased from 11.4 d (interquartile range [IQR] = 8.5-14.5) to 8.1 d (IQR = 5.4-9.3) (p = 0.04), although not among confirmed cases (median 7.5 [IQR = 4.9-10.0] versus 7.3 [IQR = 3.4-9.0], p = 0.51). Prevalence of rifampicin resistance detected by Xpert was 3.3% (95% CI = 2.4%, 4.3%) among new patients and 7.4% (95% CI = 4.3%, 11.7%) among retreatment patients, with a 98% (95% CI = 87%, 99%) positive predictive value compared to phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Missing data in the information systems may have biased our primary endpoints. However, sensitivity analyses assessing the effects of missing data did not affect our results.
Replacing smear microscopy with Xpert MTB/RIF in Brazil increased confirmation of pulmonary TB. An additional benefit was the accurate detection of rifampicin resistance. However, no increase on overall notification rates was observed, possibly because of high rates of empirical TB treatment.

25476763,Energetics of pathogenic bacteria and opportunities for drug development.,"Bacterial energetics, Drug targets, Pathogenic bacteria, Physiology, Respiration",Advances in microbial physiology,"The emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens and our inability to develop new antimicrobials to overcome resistance has inspired scientists to consider new targets for drug development. Cellular bioenergetics is an area showing promise for the development of new antimicrobials, particularly in the discovery of new anti-tuberculosis drugs where several new compounds have entered clinical trials. In this review, we have examined the bioenergetics of various bacterial pathogens, highlighting the versatility of electron donor and acceptor utilisation and the modularity of electron transport chain components in bacteria. In addition to re-examining classical concepts, we explore new literature that reveals the intricacies of pathogen energetics, for example, how Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter jejuni exploit host and microbiota to derive powerful electron donors and sinks; the strategies Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa use to persist in lung tissues; and the importance of sodium energetics and electron bifurcation in the chemiosmotic anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum. A combination of physiological, biochemical, and pharmacological data suggests that, in addition to the clinically-approved target F1Fo-ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase type II, succinate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase, cytochrome bd oxidase, and menaquinone biosynthesis pathways are particularly promising next-generation drug targets. The realisation of cellular energetics as a rich target space for the development of new antimicrobials will be dependent upon gaining increased understanding of the energetic processes utilised by pathogens in host environments and the ability to design bacterial-specific inhibitors of these processes.",,,,2014-12-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
25473034,PET/CT imaging correlates with treatment outcome in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Science translational medicine,"Definitive clinical trials of new chemotherapies for treating tuberculosis (TB) require following subjects until at least 6 months after treatment discontinuation to assess for durable cure, making these trials expensive and lengthy. Surrogate endpoints relating to treatment failure and relapse are currently limited to sputum microbiology, which has limited sensitivity and specificity. We prospectively assessed radiographic changes using 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) at 2 and 6 months (CT only) in a cohort of subjects with multidrug-resistant TB, who were treated with second-line TB therapy for 2 years and then followed for an additional 6 months. CT scans were read semiquantitatively by radiologists and were computationally evaluated using custom software to provide volumetric assessment of TB-associated abnormalities. CT scans at 6 months (but not 2 months) assessed by radiologist readers were predictive of outcomes, and changes in computed abnormal volumes were predictive of drug response at both time points. Quantitative changes in FDG uptake 2 months after starting treatment were associated with long-term outcomes. In this cohort, some radiologic markers were more sensitive than conventional sputum microbiology in distinguishing successful from unsuccessful treatment. These results support the potential of imaging scans as possible surrogate endpoints in clinical trials of new TB drug regimens. Larger cohorts confirming these results are needed.",,,,2014-12-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

After decades of quiescence in the development of antituberculosis medications, bedaquiline and delamanid have been conditionally approved for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, while several other novel compounds (AZD5847, PA-824, SQ109 and sutezolid) have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials. Before novel drugs can find their place in the battle against drug-resistant tuberculosis, linezolid has been compassionately used with success in the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

25423041,Impact of Xpert MTB/RIF for TB diagnosis in a primary care clinic with high TB and HIV prevalence in South Africa: a pragmatic randomised trial.,,PLoS medicine,"Xpert MTB/RIF is approved for use in tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin-resistance diagnosis. However, data are limited on the impact of Xpert under routine conditions in settings with high TB burden.
A pragmatic prospective cluster-randomised trial of Xpert for all individuals with presumptive (symptomatic) TB compared to the routine diagnostic algorithm of sputum microscopy and limited use of culture was conducted in a large TB/HIV primary care clinic. The primary outcome was the proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases not initiating TB treatment by 3 mo after presentation. Secondary outcomes included time to TB treatment and mortality. Unblinded randomisation occurred on a weekly basis. Xpert and smear microscopy were performed on site. Analysis was both by intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol. Between 7 September 2010 and 28 October 2011, 1,985 participants were assigned to the Xpert (n = 982) and routine (n = 1,003) diagnostic algorithms (ITT analysis); 882 received Xpert and 1,063 routine (per protocol analysis). 13% (32/257) of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB (smear, culture, or Xpert) did not initiate treatment by 3 mo after presentation in the Xpert arm, compared to 25% (41/167) in the routine arm (ITT analysis, risk ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.77, p = 0.0052). The yield of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases among patients with presumptive TB was 17% (167/1,003) with routine diagnosis and 26% (257/982) with Xpert diagnosis (ITT analysis, risk ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.87, p<0.001). This difference in diagnosis rates resulted in a higher rate of treatment initiation in the Xpert arm: 23% (229/1,003) and 28% (277/982) in the routine and Xpert arms, respectively (ITT analysis, risk ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.44, p = 0.013). Time to treatment initiation was improved overall (ITT analysis, hazard ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92, p = 0.005) and among HIV-infected participants (ITT analysis, hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85, p = 0.001). There was no difference in 6-mo mortality with Xpert versus routine diagnosis. Study limitations included incorrect intervention allocation for a high proportion of participants and that the study was conducted in a single clinic.
These data suggest that in this routine primary care setting, use of Xpert to diagnose TB increased the number of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB who were treated by 3 mo and reduced time to treatment initiation, particularly among HIV-infected participants.

We investigated how this has changed treatment and outcomes in Singapore.
A retrospective review was performed with inpatient and outpatient records for all subjects diagnosed with HIV/TB co-infection from 2006 to 2011 attending the Tuberculosis Control Unit, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. Data for subjects with a presenting CD4<200 cell/mm(3) were extracted and split into two groups, ""Delayed"": ART more than 8/52 after starting TB treatment, and ""Early"": ART within 8/52 of starting TB treatment.
One hundred thirty-four out of 180 subjects in the database met the inclusion criteria for this study, 89 in the delayed group and 45 in the early. No statistically significant differences in baseline demographics between the two groups were identified. Both groups presented with markedly low CD4 counts, with overall 60% <50cells/mm(3). Median CD4 counts were lower in the delayed ART group (37 vs 50, p=0.015). Prevalence of other opportunistic infections at TB diagnosis was not significantly different (20%), but TB in the early ART group was more likely to include extra-pulmonary disease (46% vs 57%, p=0.038). Four cases were culture negative, 2 multi-drug resistant and 10 (7.8%) were isoniazid mono-resistant. There was a significant trend to earlier ART with more recent TB diagnosis (p<0.001). In the first 365 days after TB diagnosis, 11 deaths occurred in the delayed ART group, and 0 in the early (p=0.033). A Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis demonstrated a clear separation in the frequency of death or opportunistic infections at eight weeks (Figure 1, p<0.001). Immune reconstitution disease was significantly more likely in the early ART group, but did not result in death (9% vs 38%, p<0.001). Treatment interruptions due to adverse drug events (ADE) developed in a median of 25 days (IQR 15-43). Interestingly, early ART was associated with a significantly lower number of treatment interruptions attributed to ADEs, with a higher proportion of patients completing two months of pyrazinamide induction (66% vs 85%, p=0.054) and rifampicin consolidation (79% vs 95%, p=0.03) - after excluding resistance or death. A trend to longer duration TB treatment was observed with delayed ART.

25394017,Management of drug-resistant TB in patients with HIV co-infection.,,Journal of the International AIDS Society,"The World Health Organization estimates that 450,000 cases of drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) occurred worldwide in 2012. In South Africa, over 15,000 cases were diagnosed. Over half of patients in South Africa with TB are HIV co-infected. The management of drug-resistant TB is complex, prolonged, costly, associated with multiple toxicities and thus difficult for patients to complete. Disengagement from follow-up is common. Co-infection with HIV presents a number of additional challenges in DR TB management including shared drug toxicities between TB and HIV drugs, potential for increased drug toxicity due to underlying HIV-related organ disease such as nephropathy, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome including manifestations at extrapulmonary sites. Mortality with multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB is higher in HIV-positive patients. Mortality is similar for HIV-positive and uninfected patients with extremely drug-resistant (XDR) TB, given the current lack of effective therapy, with over 70% case fatality by five years. ART improves survival in patients with DR TB, and timing of ART initiation in relation to TB treatment should be similar to patients with drug-susceptible TB. New (e.g. bedaquiline and delaminid) and repurposed (e.g. linezolid and clofazamine) drugs promise to improve the prognosis of patients with DR TB. Several clinical trials of new regimens are ongoing and planned, and early data from the Bedaquiline Clinical Access Programme in South Africa suggests much improved short-term outcomes when bedaquiline +/- linezolid and/or clofazamine are included in the regimen of patients with XDR and pre-XDR TB including patients with HIV co-infection. There are important considerations with respect to QT prolongation and ART drug interactions related to bedaquiline that need to be factored in treatment decisions and monitoring plans.",,,,2014-11-14,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
25377177,"The Global Consortium for Drug-resistant Tuberculosis Diagnostics (GCDD): design of a multi-site, head-to-head study of three rapid tests to detect extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.",,Trials,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) remains a threat to global public health, owing to the complexity and delay of diagnosis and treatment. The Global Consortium for Drug-resistant Tuberculosis Diagnostics (GCDD) was formed to develop and evaluate assays designed to rapidly detect DR-TB, so that appropriate treatment might begin more quickly. This paper describes the methodology employed in a prospective cohort study for head-to-head assessment of three different rapid diagnostic tools.
Subjects at risk of DR-TB were enrolled from three countries. Data were gathered from a combination of patient interviews, chart reviews, and laboratory testing from each site's reference laboratory. The primary outcome of interest was reduction in time from specimen arrival in the laboratory to results of rapid drug susceptibility tests, as compared with current standard mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) drug susceptibility tests.
Successful implementation of the trial in diverse multinational populations is explained, in addition to challenges encountered and recommendations for future studies with similar aims or populations.
The GCDD study was a head-to-head study of multiple rapid diagnostic assays aimed at improving accuracy and precision of diagnostics and reducing overall time to detection of DR-TB. By conducting a large prospective study, which captured epidemiological, clinical, and biological data, we have produced a high-quality unique dataset, which will be beneficial for analyzing study aims as well as answering future DR-TB research questions. Reduction in detection time for XDR-TB would be a major public health success as it would allow for improved treatment and more successful patient outcomes. Executing successful trials is critical in assessment of these reductions in highly variable populations.

25366478,Delamanid does not inhibit or induce cytochrome p450 enzymes in vitro.,,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,"Delamanid is a new drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Individuals who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may require treatment with a number of medications that might interact significantly with the CYP enzyme system as inhibitors or inducers. It is therefore important to understand how drugs in development for the treatment of tuberculosis will affect CYP enzyme metabolism. The ability of delamanid to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes was investigated in vitro using human liver microsomes or human hepatocytes. Delamanid (100 µM) had little potential for mechanism-based inactivation on eight CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Delamanid's metabolites were noted to inhibit the metabolism of some CYP isoforms, but these effects were observed only at metabolite concentrations that were well above those observed in human plasma during clinical trials. Delamanid (≤10 µM) did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 activities in human hepatocytes, and there were no increases in CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 mRNA levels. Taken together, these data suggest that delamanid is unlikely to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions when co-administered with products that are metabolized by the CYP enzyme system.",,,,2014-11-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
25353401,The diagnostic accuracy of the GenoType(®) MTBDRsl assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Accurate and rapid tests for tuberculosis (TB) drug resistance are critical for improving patient care and decreasing the transmission of drug-resistant TB. Genotype(®)MTBDRsl (MTBDRsl) is the only commercially-available molecular test for detecting resistance in TB to the fluoroquinolones (FQs; ofloxacin, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin) and the second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs; amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin), which are used to treat patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR-)TB.
To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for FQ resistance, SLID resistance and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB; defined as MDR-TB plus resistance to a FQ and a SLID) when performed (1) indirectly (ie on culture isolates confirmed as TB positive) and (2) directly (ie on smear-positive sputum specimens).To compare summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for FQ resistance, SLID resistance and XDR-TB by type of testing (indirect versus direct testing).The populations of interest were adults with drug-susceptible TB or drug-resistant TB. The settings of interest were intermediate and central laboratories.
We searched the following databases without any language restriction up to 30 January 2014: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Knowledge; MEDION; LILACS; BIOSIS; SCOPUS; the metaRegister of Controlled Trials; the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I.
We included all studies that determined MTBDRsl accuracy against a defined reference standard (culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST), genetic testing or both). We included cross-sectional and diagnostic case-control studies. We excluded unpublished data and conference proceedings.
For each study, two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and assessed study quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We performed meta-analyses to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of MTBDRsl for FQ resistance, SLID resistance, and XDR-TB. We explored the influence of different reference standards. We performed the majority of analyses using a bivariate random-effects model against culture-based DST as the reference standard.
We included 21 unique studies: 14 studies reported the accuracy of MTBDRsl when done directly, five studies when done indirectly and two studies that did both. Of the 21 studies, 15 studies (71%) were cross-sectional and 11 studies (58%) were located in low-income or middle-income countries. All studies but two were written in English. Nine (43%) of the 21 included studies had a high risk of bias for patient selection. At least half of the studies had low risk of bias for the other QUADAS-2 domains.As a test for FQ resistance measured against culture-based DST, the pooled sensitivity of MTBDRsl when performed indirectly was 83.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.7% to 86.7%) and the pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI 94.3% to 99.1%), respectively (16 studies, 1766 participants; 610 confirmed cases of FQ-resistant TB; moderate quality evidence). When performed directly, the pooled sensitivity was 85.1% (95% CI 71.9% to 92.7%) and the pooled specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 96.8% to 99.0%), respectively (seven studies, 1033 participants; 230 confirmed cases of FQ-resistant TB; moderate quality evidence). For indirect testing for FQ resistance, four (0.2%) of 1766 MTBDRsl results were indeterminate, whereas for direct testing 20 (1.9%) of 1033 were MTBDRsl indeterminate (P < 0.001).As a test for SLID resistance measured against culture-based DST, the pooled sensitivity of MTBDRsl when performed indirectly was 76.9% (95% CI 61.1% to 87.6%) and the pooled specificity was 99.5% (95% CI 97.1% to 99.9%), respectively (14 studies, 1637 participants; 414 confirmed cases of SLID-resistant TB; moderate quality evidence). For amikacin resistance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 87.9% (95% CI 82.1% to 92.0%) and 99.5% (95% CI 97.5% to 99.9%), respectively. For kanamycin resistance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 66.9% (95% CI 44.1% to 83.8%) and 98.6% (95% CI 96.1% to 99.5%), respectively. For capreomycin resistance, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 79.5% (95% CI 58.3% to 91.4%) and 95.8% (95% CI 93.4% to 97.3%), respectively. When performed directly, the pooled sensitivity for SLID resistance was 94.4% (95% CI 25.2% to 99.9%) and the pooled specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 88.9% to 99.7%), respectively (six studies, 947 participants; 207 confirmed cases of SLID-resistant TB, 740 SLID susceptible cases of TB; very low quality evidence). For indirect testing for SLID resistance, three (0.4%) of 774 MTBDRsl results were indeterminate, whereas for direct testing 53 (6.1%) of 873 were MTBDRsl indeterminate (P < 0.001).As a test for XDR-TB measured against culture-based DST, the pooled sensitivity of MTBDRsl when performed indirectly was 70.9% (95% CI 42.9% to 88.8%) and the pooled specificity was 98.8% (95% CI 96.1% to 99.6%), respectively (eight studies, 880 participants; 173 confirmed cases of XDR-TB; low quality evidence).
In adults with TB, a positive MTBDRsl result for FQ resistance, SLID resistance, or XDR-TB can be treated with confidence. However, MTBDRsl does not detect approximately one in five cases of FQ-resistant TB, and does not detect approximately one in four cases of SLID-resistant TB. Of the three SLIDs, MTBDRsl has the poorest sensitivity for kanamycin resistance. MTBDRsl will miss between one in four and one in three cases of XDR-TB. The diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl is similar when done using either culture isolates or smear-positive sputum. As the location of the resistance causing mutations can vary on a strain-by-strain basis, further research is required on test accuracy in different settings and, if genetic sequencing is used as a reference standard, it should examine all resistance-determining regions. Given the confidence one can have in a positive result, and the ability of the test to provide results within a matter of days, MTBDRsl may be used as an initial test for second-line drug resistance. However, when the test reports a negative result, clinicians may still wish to carry out conventional testing.",,,,2014-10-30,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Delamanid , a new nitro-hydro-imidazooxazole derivative, inhibits mycolic acid synthesis. This review covers the efficacy and safety of delamanid for MDR-TB.
This paper reviews the pharmacological profile of delamanid and the results of clinical trials evaluating its efficacy for treating MDR-TB in combination with other anti-TB drugs. The drug's safety and tolerability profiles are also considered.
Delamanid showed potent activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In clinical trials, the drug showed significant early bactericidal activity in pulmonary TB patients, and increased culture conversion after 2 months of treatment in combination with an optimized background regimen in MDR-TB patients. In addition, decreased mortality was observed in MDR-TB patients who received > 6 months of delamanid treatment. The drug was generally tolerable, but QT prolongation should be monitored carefully using electrocardiograms and potassium levels. Therefore, delamanid could be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary MDR-TB in adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability.",,,,2014-10-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

25238411,Time to culture conversion and regimen composition in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment.,,PloS one,"Sputum cultures are an important tool in monitoring the response to tuberculosis treatment, especially in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. There has, however, been little study of the effect of treatment regimen composition on culture conversion. Well-designed clinical trials of new anti-tuberculosis drugs require this information to establish optimized background regimens for comparison. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess whether the use of an aggressive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimen was associated with more rapid sputum culture conversion. We conducted Cox proportional-hazards analyses to examine the relationship between receipt of an aggressive regimen for the 14 prior consecutive days and sputum culture conversion. Sputum culture conversion was achieved in 519 (87.7%) of the 592 patients studied. Among patients who had sputum culture conversion, the median time to conversion was 59 days (IQR: 31-92). In 480 patients (92.5% of those with conversion), conversion occurred within the first six months of treatment.

Bedaquiline works by inhibiting bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and represents the first novel class of antituberculosis agents in more than 40 years. Bedaquiline is indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in combination with at least three other antitubercular drugs when no other effective regimen is available. The recommended bedaquiline dosage is 400 mg orally once/day for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg orally 3 times/week for 22 weeks. Bedaquiline should be administered with food, which increases the bioavailability 2-fold. Bedaquiline is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 and is impacted by both inducers and inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Concentration-dependent bactericidal activity was observed in laboratory and murine studies. Accelerated approval was granted in the United States and European Union based on the results of two phase IIb clinical studies that used sputum culture clearance as a surrogate end point for clinical efficacy. These studies showed greater sputum culture clearance up to week 24 for the bedaquiline group compared with placebo. Common adverse events in clinical trials included nausea, arthralgia, and headache. Serious adverse events included elevated serum transaminase levels and rate-corrected QT-interval prolongation. Unexplained higher mortality was seen in patients receiving bedaquiline versus those receiving placebo. Bedaquiline is a novel agent with a unique mechanism of action and has the potential to meet a great need in patients with MDR TB who have no other treatment options. Due to safety concerns and limited clinical information, phase III trials are needed to fully determine its place in therapy.",,,,2014-09-10,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

A series of cohort studies conducted in Bangladesh identified a nine-month regimen with very promising results. There is a need to evaluate this regimen in comparison with the currently recommended regimen in a randomized controlled trial in a variety of settings, including patients with HIV-coinfection.
STREAM is a multi-centre randomized trial of non-inferiority design comparing a nine-month regimen to the treatment currently recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with MDR pulmonary TB with no evidence on line probe assay of fluoroquinolone or kanamycin resistance. The nine-month regimen includes clofazimine and high-dose moxifloxacin and can be extended to 11 months in the event of delay in smear conversion. The primary outcome is based on the bacteriological status of the patients at 27 months post-randomization. Based on the assumption that the nine-month regimen will be slightly more effective than the control regimen and, given a 10% margin of non-inferiority, a total of 400 patients are required to be enrolled. Health economics data are being collected on all patients in selected sites.
The results from the study in Bangladesh and cohorts in progress elsewhere are encouraging, but for this regimen to be recommended more widely than in a research setting, robust evidence is needed from a randomized clinical trial. Results from the STREAM trial together with data from ongoing cohorts should provide the evidence necessary to revise current recommendations for the treatment for MDR-TB.

Courses of therapy select for these mutants and drug-resistant organisms emerge. The development of drug-resistant organisms has reached the point that drug resistance now threatens to undermine global success against tuberculosis (TB). New drugs are needed. The last new class of drugs specifically developed for treatment of TB was the rifamycins over 40 years ago. New funding sources and the development of product development partnerships have energized the TB drug development effort. There are now more TB drugs in development than at any time in the past. The first of these drugs to be developed and marketed was bedaquiline. Bedaquiline has an entirely novel mechanism of action and so should be active against otherwise highly resistant organisms. It acts on the transmembrane component of adenosine triphosphate synthase and acts by preventing electron transport. This raises the exciting possibility that bedaquiline may be active against less metabolically active organisms. Drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and the cytochrome P450-3A system will limit bedaquiline's utility and create complexity in treatment regimens. In clinical trials, treatment with bedaquiline added to a background multidrug-resistant TB regimen was associated with earlier culture conversion and higher cure rates, but there were unexplained excess deaths in the bedaquiline arms of these trials. Food and Drug Administration approved bedaquiline for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided. They required a black box warning about excess deaths and require that a phase III trial be completed. A planned Phase III trial is being reorganized. While bedaquiline is an exciting drug and marks a dramatic moment in the history of TB treatment, its ultimate place in the anti-TB drug armamentarium is unclear pending the Phase III trial and the development of other new drugs that are in the pipeline.",,,,2014-08-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Bedaquiline is a novel drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB; combined use with antiretroviral drugs, nevirapine, or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) is anticipated, but no clinical data from coinfected patients are available. Plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and its M2 metabolite after single doses were obtained from interaction studies with nevirapine or LPV/r in healthy volunteers. The antiretrovirals' effects on bedaquiline and M2 pharmacokinetics were assessed by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Potential dose adjustments were evaluated with simulations. No significant effects of nevirapine on bedaquiline pharmacokinetics were identified. LPV/r decreased bedaquiline and M2 clearances to 35% (relative standard error [RSE], 9.2%) and 58% (RSE, 8.4%), respectively, of those without comedication. As almost 3-fold (bedaquiline) and 2-fold (M2) increases in exposures during chronic treatment with LPV/r are expected, dose adjustments are suggested for evaluation. Efficacious, safe bedaquiline dosing for MDR-TB patients receiving antiretrovirals is important. Modeling results suggest that bedaquiline can be coadministered with nevirapine without dose adjustments. The predicted elevation of bedaquiline and M2 levels during LPV/r coadministration may be a safety concern, and careful monitoring is recommended. Further data are being collected in coinfected patients to determine whether dose adjustments are needed.

In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.",,,,2014-08-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

An estimated 382 million people worldwide currently have diabetes, half of whom are undiagnosed. Most live in low- and middle-income countries alongside many of the two billion individuals infected with TB. Though the frequency of TB in type 1 diabetes was known for centuries, only recently have we observed the tripling of TB in type 2 diabetes, most significantly in high-burden TB populations such as in Peru, Russia, and the People's Republic of China. In India diabetes is estimated to have increased TB cases by 46% between 1998 and 2008. Diabetes is a greater long-term threat to TB control than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since ten-fold more people are affected by diabetes than HIV/AIDS in larger geographic areas. Diabetes in TB increases drug resistance, treatment failure, and mortality, and may increase the spread of drug-resistant strains. Delayed or missed diagnosis fuels transmission of TB and hinders control of diabetes. Tailored treatment for diabetes patients requires well-designed clinical trials. The World Health Organization (WHO) framework for care and control of diabetes and TB needs improved screening strategies. Determination of how best to establish bi-directional screening is hampered by lack of affordable and reliable methods. Recommendations include education of health care providers, patients, and communities. Structured diabetes programs with registries and effective follow-up could be modeled on and communicate with existing TB programs. Vital research should address new diagnostic tools, lowering cost and evaluation of intervention strategies, as well as better understanding of the impaired immune responses that make diabetes patients more susceptible to TB leading to targeted therapies.

The objective of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for bedaquiline to describe the concentration-time data from phase I and II studies in healthy subjects and patients with drug-susceptible or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). A total of 5,222 PK observations from 480 subjects were used in a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The PK was described with a 4-compartment disposition model with dual zero-order input (to capture dual peaks observed during absorption) and long terminal half-life (t1/2). The model included between-subject variability on apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F), the fraction of dose via the first input, and bioavailability (F). Bedaquiline was widely distributed, with apparent volume at steady state of >10,000 liters and low clearance. The long terminal t1/2 was likely due to redistribution from the tissue compartments.

However, the emergence of rADI resistance, due to the overexpression of argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), has introduced an obstacle in its clinical application. Here, we have proposed a strategy for the intracellular delivery of rADI, which depletes both extracellular and intracellular arginine, to restore the sensitivity of rADI-resistant cancer cells. In this study, the C terminus of heparin-binding hemagglutinin adhesion protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (HBHAc), which contains 23 amino acids, was used to deliver rADI into rADI-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). Chemical conjugates (l- and d-HBHAc-SPDP-rADI) and a recombinant fusion protein (rHBHAc-ADI) were produced. l- and d-HBHAc-SPDP-rADI showed a significantly higher cellular uptake of rADI by MCF-7 cells compared to that of rADI alone. Cell viability was significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in response to l- and d-HBHAc-SPDP-rADI treatments. In addition, the ratio of intracellular concentration of citrulline to arginine in cells treated with l- and d-HBHAc-SPDP-rADI was significantly increased by 1.4- and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with that obtained in cells treated with rADI alone (p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained with the recombinant fusion protein rHBHAc-ADI. Our study demonstrates that the increased cellular uptake of rADI by HBHAc modification can restore the sensitivity of rADI treatment in MCF-7 cells. rHBHAc-ADI may represent a novel class of antitumor enzyme with an intracellular mechanism that is independent of AS expression.",,,,2014-06-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Contraindications for BCG vaccination include HIV infection and other conditions of immunosuppression. Tuberculosis is a global problem difficult to control because of three main reasons: poor diagnostics in developing countries, long-term therapy or discontinuation of treatment resulting in the emergence of drug-resistant mycobacteria, and the availability of a TB vaccine which only protects children from the most severe forms of tuberculosis. BCG has little to no efficacy in preventing the most common adult pulmonary TB. The development of a more effective vaccine against tuberculosis is undoubtedly still a public health priority in order to improve control of the disease throughout the world. Elimination of TB as a global public health goal by 2050 is particularly ambitious and its achievement depends on the development and application of new intervention measures and newly designed vaccines. Currently, 14 newly developed products are undergoing clinical trials.

Although currently available marketed BCG vaccine has shown sufficient protection against childhood tuberculosis, it has failed to prevent the most common form of disease i.e., pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. However, various vaccine candidates have already entered phase I clinical trials and have shown promising outcomes. The most prominent amongst them is the heterologous prime-boost approach, which shows a great promise towards designing and development of a new efficacious tuberculosis vaccine. It has also been shown that the use of various viral and non-viral vectors as carriers for the potential vaccine candidates will further boost their effect on subsequent immunization.

Novel vaccination strategies are urgently needed to arrest global transmission and prevent the uncontrolled development of multidrug-resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in the field of vaccine development with numerous innovative preclinical candidates and more than a dozen vaccines in clinical trials. These vaccines are developed either as boosters of the current BCG vaccine or as novel prime vaccines to replace BCG. Given the enormous prevalence of latent TB infection, vaccines that are protective on top of an already established infection remain a high priority and a significant scientific challenge.

24813349,Antimicrobial peptides and proteins in mycobacterial therapy: current status and future prospects.,"Antimicrobial peptides, Granulocytes, Macrophages, Mycobacteria, Tuberculosis","Tuberculosis (Edinburgh, Scotland)","Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), kills about 1.5 million people every year worldwide. An increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb in the last few decades now necessitates the development of novel drugs that combat infections by both drug-sensitive and resistant Mtb. Moreover, as Mtb can persist in host cells by modulating their immune responses, it is essential that anti-TB agents be able to penetrate macrophages and kill the pathogen intracellularly without harming the host cells. In this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins are being harnessed as anti-infective agents for the treatment of various diseases. Due to their direct and rapid bactericidal activity it is unlikely that pathogens acquire resistance against AMPs. Several short and potent AMP derivatives have been prepared by peptide engineering, and several of them are currently evaluated in clinical trials. The present review summarizes the role of endogenously expressed AMPs and proteins in the treatment of tuberculosis infections. In addition, mechanisms of direct anti-mycobacterial activity, manipulation of host immune responses, and future prospects of AMPs as therapeutic agents are discussed.",,,,2014-05-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

However, data concerning Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance are lacking because of the insufficient processing capacity. So, the aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the resistance patterns and the strain lineages of a sample of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates collected in the two main cities of Congo.
Over a 9-day period, 114 smear-positive sputa isolated from 114 patients attending centers for the diagnosis and treatment of TB in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire were collected for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). Detection of mutations conferring drug resistance was performed by using line probe assays (GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl) and DNA sequencing. Strain lineages were determined by MIRU-VNTR genotyping.
Of the 114 sputa, 46 were culture positive for MTBC. Twenty-one (46%) were resistant to one or more first-line antiTB drugs. Of these, 15 (71%) were multidrug resistant (MDR). The most prevalent mutations involved in rifampin and isoniazid resistance, D516V (60%) in rpoB and S315T (87%) in katG respectively, were well detected by MTBDRplus assay. All the 15 MDR strains were susceptible to fluoroquinolone and injectable second-line drug. No mutation was detected in the rrs locus involved in resistance to amikacin and capreomycin by both the MTBDRsl assay and DNA sequencing. By contrast, 9 MDR strains belonging to the same cluster related to T-family were identified as being falsely resistant to fluoroquinolone by the MTBDRsl assay due to the presence of a double substitution T80A-A90G in GyrA.

The emerging epidemic of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB has fuelled the debate about TB vaccines, as increasing numbers of patients can no longer be cured by pharmacotherapy. Of several proposed modalities, TB vaccines administered in therapeutic manner represents a promising alternative, despite the controversial history due to the occurrence of exacerbated immune response. A modified concept of immunotherapy is required in order to justify further exploration. In this paper we systematically reviewed the most advanced therapeutic vaccines for TB. We address the rationale of immunotherapeutic vaccination combined with optimized pharmacotherapy in active TB. We summarize preclinical and patient data regarding the five most advanced therapeutic vaccines currently in the pipeline. Of the five products that have been tested in animal models and in humans during active or latent TB, the quality of the published clinical reports of two of these products justify further studies in patients with active TB.

Pulmonary cavitation, the hallmark of established disease, is associated with very high bacillary burden. Cavitation may lead to delayed sputum culture conversion, emergence of drug resistance, and transmission of the infection. The host immunological reaction to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is implicated in driving the development of TB cavities. TB is characterized by a matrix-degrading phenotype in which the activity of proteolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is relatively unopposed by the specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Proteases, in particular MMPs, secreted from monocyte-derived cells, neutrophils, and stromal cells, are involved in both cell recruitment and tissue damage and may cause cavitation. MMP activity is augmented by proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, is tightly regulated by complex signaling paths, and causes matrix destruction. MMP concentrations are elevated in human TB and are closely associated with clinical and radiological markers of lung tissue destruction. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting MMPs in preclinical and clinical trials are potential adjuncts to TB treatment.

Though BDQ has shown excellent efficacy in clinical trials, its early bactericidal activity during the first week of chemotherapy is minimal. Here, using microfluidic devices and time-lapse microscopy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we confirm the absence of significant bacteriolytic activity during the first 3-4 days of exposure to BDQ. BDQ-induced inhibition of ATP synthesis leads to bacteriostasis within hours after drug addition. Transcriptional and proteomic analyses reveal that M. tuberculosis responds to BDQ by induction of the dormancy regulon and activation of ATP-generating pathways, thereby maintaining bacterial viability during initial drug exposure. BDQ-induced bacterial killing is significantly enhanced when the mycobacteria are grown on non-fermentable energy sources such as lipids (impeding ATP synthesis via glycolysis).

The World Health Organization estimates that HIV prevalence among children with tuberculosis, in countries with moderate to high prevalence, ranges from 10 to 60%. The mechanisms promoting susceptibility of people with HIV to tuberculosis disease are incompletely understood, being likely caused by multifactorial processes. Paediatric tuberculosis and HIV have overlapping clinical manifestations, which could lead to missed or late diagnosis. Although every effort should be made to obtain a microbiologically-confirmed diagnosis in children with tuberculosis, in reality this may only be achieved in a minority, reflecting their paucibacillary nature and the difficulties in obtain samples. Rapid polymerase chain reaction tests, such as Xpert MTB/RIF assay, are increasingly used in children. The use of less or non invasive methods of sample collection, such as naso-pharyngeal aspirates and stool samples for a polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic test tests and mycobacterial cultures is promising technique in HIV negative and HIV positive children. Anti-tuberculosis treatment should be started immediately at diagnosis with a four drug regimen, irrespective of the disease severity. Moreover, tuberculosis disease in an HIV infected child is considered to be a clinical indication for initiation of antiretroviral treatment. The World Health Organization recommends starting antiretroviral treatment in children as soon as anti-tuberculosis treatment is tolerated and within 2- 8 weeks after initiating it. The treatment of choice depends on the child's age and availability of age-appropriate formulations, and potential drug interactions and resistance.

In the last years, the repurposing of existing drugs for new clinical applications has become a major research area in drug discovery, also in the field of anti-infectives. This review discusses the potential of repurposing previously approved gallium formulations in antibacterial chemotherapy. Gallium has no proven function in biological systems, but it can act as an iron-mimetic in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The activity of gallium mostly relies on its ability to replace iron in redox enzymes, thus impairing their function and ultimately hampering cell growth. Cancer cells and bacteria are preferential gallium targets due to their active metabolism and fast growth. The wealth of knowledge on the pharmacological properties of gallium has opened the door to the repurposing of gallium-based drugs for the treatment of infections sustained by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for suppression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. The promising antibacterial activity of gallium both in vitro and in different animal models of infection raises the hope that gallium will confirm its efficacy in clinical trials, and will become a valuable therapeutic option to cure otherwise untreatable bacterial infections.",,,,2014-02-18,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

30 patients with microbiologically confirmed MDR or XDR tuberculosis were treated with single-dose autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs (aimed for 1×10(6) cells per kg), within 4 weeks of the start of antituberculosis-drug treatment in a specialist centre in Minsk, Belarus. Inclusion patients were those with pulmonary tuberculosis confirmed by sputum smear microscopy, culture, or both; MDR or XDR tuberculosis confirmed by drug-susceptibility testing to first-line and second-line drugs; age older than 21 years to 65 years or younger; and absence of lesion compatible with a malignant process or ongoing tuberculosis in organs other than the lungs and pleura. In addition to the inclusion criteria, patients were excluded if they were pregnant, coinfected with HIV, or infected with hepatitis B, C, or both. The primary endpoint was safety measured by MSC-infusion related events; any tuberculosis-related event within the 6 month observation period that related to a worsening of the underlying infectious disease, measured by conversion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture or microscopic examination; or any adverse event defined clinically or by changes in blood haematology and biochemistry variables, measured monthly for 6 months after MSC infusion per protocol. This study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Registry, number DRKS00000763.
The most common (grade 1 or 2) adverse events were high cholesterol levels (14 of 30 patients), nausea (11 of 30 patients), and lymphopenia or diarrhoea (ten of 30 patients). There were no serious adverse events reported. We recorded two grade 3 events that were transitory-ie, increased plasma potassium ion concentrations in one patient and a transitory grade 3 γ-glutamyltransferase elevation in another patient.
MSCs as an adjunct therapy are safe and can now be explored further for the treatment of patients with MDR or XDR tuberculosis in combination with standard drug regimens. Adjunct treatment with MSCs needs to be evaluated in controlled phase 2 trials to assess effects on immune responses and clinical and microbiological outcomes.",,,,2014-02-08,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24492372,Novel regimens identified in mice for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Preventing the development of tuberculosis (TB) in contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) by the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is highly desirable. However, few safe, well tolerated, and effective drugs are available to treat MDR-LTBI and the published guidance is limited. Fortunately, six new chemical entities from four classes developed to treat TB have entered clinical trials in the past decade. We tested three of these drugs alone and in combination in an experimental paucibacillary LTBI chemotherapy model using BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ mice immunized with a recombinant strain of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (rBCG30) and then challenged with a low-dose aerosol of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The regimens tested contained bedaquiline (TMC), PA-824 (Pa), sutezolid (PNU), and/or one of two fluoroquinolones. Control mice received rifampin (RIF) or isoniazid (INH). In BALB/c mice, TMC-containing regimens and the Pa-PNU combination were the most active test regimens and were at least as effective as RIF. Pa, PNU, and levofloxacin had activity comparable to that of INH. Virtually identical results were observed in C3HeB/FeJ mice. This study confirms the potent activity of TMC observed previously in BALB/c mice and highlights Pa alone or in combination with either PNU or a fluoroquinolone as a regimen worthy of evaluation in future clinical trials of MDR-LTBI. Given their closer pathological representation of human TB lesions, C3HeB/FeJ mice may become a preferred model for the experimental chemotherapy of LTBI. Future studies should evaluate additional clinically relevant LTBI regimens in this strain including relapse as an endpoint.",,,,2014-02-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24488376,Dose regimen of para-aminosalicylic acid gastro-resistant formulation (PAS-GR) in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Clinical drug investigation,"Resurgence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has raised a renewed interest in para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and other efficacious drugs. A gastro-resistant granule formulation (PAS-GR) was designed to be better tolerated than earlier forms of PAS, with fewer adverse effects from reduced production of meta-aminophenol. PAS release from PAS-GR granules is slower than with earlier formulations. Pharmacokinetic data are, however, limited and only a few studies have assisted in defining the best PAS-GR dose regimen. Interest in refining the latter continues and recent data contributed in better defining the optimal PAS-GR dose regimen in adults and children. The present paper draws on these recent studies, synthesizes pharmacokinetic results from different population groups, and draws comparisons with in vitro data and the results of earlier pharmacokinetic studies in order to discuss the most appropriate dosing regimen for PAS-GR.
A comparative in vitro dissolution study was carried out with a 1 g acid PAS equivalent of various formulations of PAS and PAS-GR and in vitro-in vivo correlations. Retrospective comparisons between recent and earlier clinical studies were also gathered to clarify the dose regimen of PAS-GR in adults and children.
Exposure after a 4 g twice- or three times daily dose regimen in adult MDR-TB patients confirmed that both dose regimens can be used. The twice-daily dose regimen does not, however, confer any safety margin over the potentiality of ""too"" high plasma concentrations after a three times daily dose regimen and may lead to under-dosage when a dose is missed, as compliance often decreases over time.
Based on available data and practical considerations, a 4 g three times daily dose regimen of PAS-GR should be the preferred dose in hospital settings, where it remains the best regimen to cover the around-the-clock suppression of mycobacteria based on the minimal inhibitory concentration for PAS. In MDR-TB adults and in hospital settings, there is no safety advantage in administering a regimen of 4 g twice daily. As compliance is critical to the effectiveness of the treatment, a 4 g three times daily dose regimen may be more forgiving if the patient misses a dose.",,"Exposure after a 4 g twice- or three times daily dose regimen in adult MDR-TB patients confirmed that both dose regimens can be used.

24448973,Xpert® MTB/RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Accurate, rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and TB drug resistance is critical for improving patient care and decreasing TB transmission. Xpert® MTB/RIF assay is an automated test that can detect both TB and rifampicin resistance, generally within two hours after starting the test, with minimal hands-on technical time. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued initial recommendations on Xpert® MTB/RIF in early 2011. A Cochrane Review on the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert® MTB/RIF for pulmonary TB and rifampicin resistance was published January 2013. We performed this updated Cochrane Review as part of a WHO process to develop updated guidelines on the use of the test.
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert® MTB/RIF for pulmonary TB (TB detection), where Xpert® MTB/RIF was used as both an initial test replacing microscopy and an add-on test following a negative smear microscopy result.To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert® MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection, where Xpert® MTB/RIF was used as the initial test replacing culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST).The populations of interest were adults presumed to have pulmonary, rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), with or without HIV infection. The settings of interest were intermediate- and peripheral-level laboratories. The latter may be associated with primary health care facilities.
We searched for publications in any language up to 7 February 2013 in the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Knowledge; MEDION; LILACS; BIOSIS; and SCOPUS. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the search portal of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify ongoing trials.
We included randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies using respiratory specimens that allowed for extraction of data evaluating Xpert® MTB/RIF against the reference standard. We excluded gastric fluid specimens. The reference standard for TB was culture and for rifampicin resistance was phenotypic culture-based DST.
For each study, two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form. When possible, we extracted data for subgroups by smear and HIV status. We assessed the quality of studies using QUADAS-2 and carried out meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity of Xpert® MTB/RIF separately for TB detection and rifampicin resistance detection. For TB detection, we performed the majority of analyses using a bivariate random-effects model and compared the sensitivity of Xpert® MTB/RIF and smear microscopy against culture as reference standard. For rifampicin resistance detection, we undertook univariate meta-analyses for sensitivity and specificity separately to include studies in which no rifampicin resistance was detected.
We included 27 unique studies (integrating nine new studies) involving 9557 participants. Sixteen studies (59%) were performed in low- or middle-income countries. For all QUADAS-2 domains, most studies were at low risk of bias and low concern regarding applicability.As an initial test replacing smear microscopy, Xpert® MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 89% [95% Credible Interval (CrI) 85% to 92%] and pooled specificity 99% (95% CrI 98% to 99%), (22 studies, 8998 participants: 2953 confirmed TB, 6045 non-TB).As an add-on test following a negative smear microscopy result, Xpert®MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 67% (95% CrI 60% to 74%) and pooled specificity 99% (95% CrI 98% to 99%; 21 studies, 6950 participants).For smear-positive, culture-positive TB, Xpert® MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 98% (95% CrI 97% to 99%; 21 studies, 1936 participants).For people with HIV infection, Xpert® MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 79% (95% CrI 70% to 86%; 7 studies, 1789 participants), and for people without HIV infection, it was 86% (95% CrI 76% to 92%; 7 studies, 1470 participants). Comparison with smear microscopy In comparison with smear microscopy, Xpert® MTB/RIF increased TB detection among culture-confirmed cases by 23% (95% CrI 15% to 32%; 21 studies, 8880 participants).For TB detection, if pooled sensitivity estimates for Xpert® MTB/RIF and smear microscopy are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients where 10% of those with symptoms have TB, Xpert® MTB/RIF will diagnose 88 cases and miss 12 cases, whereas sputum microscopy will diagnose 65 cases and miss 35 cases. Rifampicin resistance For rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert® MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 95% (95% CrI 90% to 97%; 17 studies, 555 rifampicin resistance positives) and pooled specificity was 98% (95% CrI 97% to 99%; 24 studies, 2411 rifampicin resistance negatives). Among 180 specimens with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), Xpert® MTB/RIF was positive in only one specimen that grew NTM (14 studies, 2626 participants).For rifampicin resistance detection, if the pooled accuracy estimates for Xpert® MTB/RIF are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals where 15% of those with symptoms are rifampicin resistant, Xpert® MTB/RIF would correctly identify 143 individuals as rifampicin resistant and miss eight cases, and correctly identify 833 individuals as rifampicin susceptible and misclassify 17 individuals as resistant. Where 5% of those with symptoms are rifampicin resistant, Xpert® MTB/RIF would correctly identify 48 individuals as rifampicin resistant and miss three cases and correctly identify 931 individuals as rifampicin susceptible and misclassify 19 individuals as resistant.
In adults thought to have TB, with or without HIV infection, Xpert® MTB/RIF is sensitive and specific. Compared with smear microscopy, Xpert® MTB/RIF substantially increases TB detection among culture-confirmed cases. Xpert® MTB/RIF has higher sensitivity for TB detection in smear-positive than smear-negative patients. Nonetheless, this test may be valuable as an add-on test following smear microscopy in patients previously found to be smear-negative. For rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert® MTB/RIF provides accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of MDR-TB treatment, pending results from conventional culture and DST. The tests are expensive, so current research evaluating the use of Xpert® MTB/RIF in TB programmes in high TB burden settings will help evaluate how this investment may help start treatment promptly and improve outcomes.",,,,2014-01-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24439237,Long-term outcomes of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa: a cohort study.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Long-term treatment-related outcomes in patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are unknown. We followed up a cohort of patients to address knowledge gaps.
Between March, 2008, and August, 2012, we prospectively followed up a cohort of 107 patients from three provinces in South Africa, who had been diagnosed with XDR tuberculosis between August 2002, and February, 2008. Available isolates from 56 patients were genotyped to establish strain type and used for extended susceptibility testing.
All patients were treated empirically as inpatients with a median of eight drugs (IQR six to ten). 44 patients (41%) had HIV. 36 (64%) of 56 isolates were resistant to at least eight drugs, and resistance to an increasing number of drugs was associated with the Beijing genotype (p=0·01). After 24 months of follow-up, 17 patients (16%) had a favourable outcome (ie, treatment cure or completion), 49 (46%) had died, seven (7%) had defaulted (interruption of treatment for at least 2 consecutive months), and 25 (23%) had failed treatment. At 60 months, 12 patients (11%) had a favourable outcome, 78 (73%) had died, four (4%) had defaulted, and 11 (10%) had failed treatment. 45 patients were discharged from hospital, of whom 26 (58%) had achieved sputum culture conversion and 19 (42%) had failed treatment. Median survival of patients who had failed treatment from time of discharge was 19·84 months (IQR 4·16-26·04). Clustering of cases and transmission within families containing a patient who had failed treatment and been discharged were shown with genotypic methods. Net sputum culture conversion occurred in 22 patients (21%) and median time to net culture conversion was 8·7 months (IQR 5·6-26·4). Independent predictors of probability of net culture conversion were no history of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (p=0·0007) and use of clofazamine (p=0·0069). Independent overall predictors of survival were net culture conversion (p<0·0001) and treatment with clofazamine (p=0·021). Antiretroviral therapy was also a predictor of survival in patients with HIV (p=0·003).
In South Africa, long-term outcomes in patients with XDR tuberculosis are poor, irrespective of HIV status. Because appropriate long-stay or palliative care facilities are scarce, substantial numbers of patients with XDR tuberculosis who have failed treatment and have positive sputum cultures are being discharged from hospital and are likely to transmit disease into the wider community. Testing of new combined regimens is needed urgently and policy makers should implement interventions to minimise disease spread by patients who fail treatment.

24438351,The importance of providing counselling and financial support to patients receiving treatment for multi-drug resistant TB: mixed method qualitative and pilot intervention studies.,,BMC public health,"People with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in low-income countries face many problems during treatment, and cure rates are low. The purpose of the study was (a) to identify and document the problems experienced by people receiving care for MDR-TB, and how they cope when support is not provided, to inform development of strategies; (b) to estimate the effectiveness of two resultant strategies, counselling alone, and joint counselling and financial support, of increasing DOTS-plus treatment success under routine programme conditions.
A mixed-method study comprising a formative qualitative study, pilot intervention study and explanatory qualitative study to better understand barriers to completion of treatment for MDR-TB. Participants were all people starting MDR-TB treatment in seven DOTS-plus centres in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal during January to December 2008. The primary outcome measure was cure, as internationally defined.
MDR-TB treatment caused extreme social, financial and employment hardship. Most patients had to move house and leave their job, and reported major stigmatisation. They were concerned about the long-term effects of their disease, and feared infecting others. In the resultant pilot intervention study, the two strategies appeared to improve treatment outcomes: cure rates for those receiving counselling, combined support and no support were 85%, 76% and 67% respectively. Compared with no support, the (adjusted) risk ratios of cure for those receiving counselling and receiving combined support were 1.2 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.6) and 1.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.6) respectively. The explanatory study demonstrated that patients valued both forms of support.
MDR-TB patients are extremely vulnerable to stigma and extreme financial hardship. Provision of counselling and financial support may not only reduce their vulnerability, but also increase cure rates. National Tuberculosis Programmes should consider incorporating financial support and counselling into MDR-TB care: costs are low, and benefits high, especially since costs to society of incomplete treatment and potential for incurable TB are extremely high.",,"MDR-TB treatment caused extreme social, financial and employment hardship.

It has been considered pandemic, since around two billion people are infected with M. tuberculosis. Multi-drug resistant TB has been the biggest challenge for chemotherapy. In order to face this severe health problem, many institutions, private and public ones, have been investing in the search for new and better drug candidates. The pipeline of potential anti-TB drugs presents new molecules and formulations that have been submitted to pre-clinical and clinical assays.

24391302,Principles for designing future regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"Fewer than 20% of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis are receiving treatment and there is an urgent need to scale up treatment programmes. One of the biggest barriers to scale-up is the treatment regimen, which is lengthy, complex, ineffective, poorly tolerated and expensive. For the first time in over 50 years, new drugs have been developed specifically to treat tuberculosis, with bedaquiline and potentially delamanid expected to be available soon for treatment of MDR cases. However, if the new drugs are merely added to the current treatment regimen, the new regimen will be at least as lengthy, cumbersome and toxic as the existing one. There is an urgent need for strategy and evidence on how to maximize the potential of the new drugs to improve outcomes and shorten treatment. We devised eight key principles for designing future treatment regimens to ensure that, once they are proven safe in clinical trials, they will be clinically effective and programmatically practicable. Regimens should contain at least one new class of drug; be broadly applicable for use against MDR and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains; contain three to five effective drugs, each from a different drug class; be delivered orally; have a simple dosing schedule; have a good side-effect profile that allows limited monitoring; last a maximum of 6 months; and have minimal interaction with antiretrovirals. Following these principles will maximize the potential of new compounds and help to overcome the clinical and programmatic disadvantages and scale-up constraints that plague the current regimen.

Emerging evidence in adults from systematic reviews and a randomized trial has shown good efficacy of linezolid in difficult cases of DR-TB but with frequent serious adverse effects. Published data in children are limited and we are unaware of formal guidelines for linezolid in treatment of paediatric DR-TB, though it will likely be an important component of DR-TB treatment for a growing number of children. We performed a structured review of existing literature on the efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in DR-TB, highlighting the key evidence from the adult literature and systematically evaluating published paediatric data. Our search identified 8 reports of 18 children receiving linezolid for difficult to treat DR-TB. All 18 had culture conversion and 15 of 18 had successful long-term treatment outcomes. Adverse events were reported in 9 of 18; a linezolid dose reduction was required in 5 of 18, and 2 of 18 permanently discontinued linezolid because of adverse events. We make specific recommendations for the use of linezolid in children with DR-TB, and identify priority questions for future research. For children with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB with additional resistance or with extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB, linezolid may make the difference between a successful or poor outcome, and until newer antituberculosis agents with better efficacy and safety become available in children, linezolid will be an important component of treatment for children with the worst forms of DR-TB.",,,,2014-01-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24386640,Pediatric tuberculosis in young children in India: a prospective study.,,BioMed research international,"India has one of the highest tuberculosis (TB) burdens globally. However, few studies have focused on TB in young children, a vulnerable population, where lack of early diagnosis results in poor outcomes.
Young children (≤ 5 years) with suspected TB were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital in Pune, India. Detailed clinical evaluation, HIV testing, mycobacterial cultures, and drug susceptibility testing were performed.
223 children with suspected TB were enrolled. The median age was 31 months, 46% were female, 86% had received BCG, 57% were malnourished, and 10% were HIV positive. 12% had TB disease (definite or probable), 35% did not have TB, while TB could not be ruled out in 53%. Extrapulmonary disease was noted in 46%, which was predominantly meningeal. Tuberculin skin test (TST) was positive in 20% of children with TB. Four of 7 (57%) children with culture-confirmed TB harbored drug-resistant (DR) strains of whom 2 (50%) were multi-DR (MDR). In adjusted analyses, HIV infection, positive TST, and exposure to household smoke were found to be significantly associated with children with TB (P ≤ 0.04). Mortality (at 1 year) was 3 of 26 (12%) and 1 of 79 (1%), respectively, in children with TB and those without TB (P < 0.05).

24363887,Targeting dormant bacilli to fight tuberculosis.,,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which kills about 2 million people annually. Furthermore, 2 billion people worldwide are latently infected with this organism, with 10% of them reactivating to active TB due to re-growth of nonreplicating (dormant) Mtb residing in their tissues. Because of the huge reservoir of latent TB it is important to find novel drugs/drug combinations killing dormant bacilli (microaerophiles, anaerobes and drug-tolerant persisters) surviving for decades in a wide spectrum of granulomatous lesions in the lungs of TB patients. Antibiotic treatment of drug-susceptible TB requires administration of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. To avoid reactivation of dormant Mtb to active pulmonary TB, up to 9 months of treatment with isoniazid is required. Therefore, a strategy to eliminate dormant bacilli needs to be developed to shorten therapy of active and latent TB and reduce the reservoir of people with latent TB. Finding drugs with high rate of penetration into the caseous granulomas and understanding the biology of dormant bacilli and in particular of persister cells, phenotypically resistant to antibiotics, will be essential to eradicate Mtb from humans. In recent years unprecedented efforts have been done in TB drug discovery, aimed at identifying novel drugs and drug combinations killing both actively replicating and nonreplicating Mtb in vitro, in animal models and in clinical trials in humans.",,,,2013-12-24,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24351780,Off-Target Effects of BCR-ABL and JAK2 Inhibitors.,,American journal of clinical oncology,"The advent of targeted oncolytic agents has created a revolution in the treatment of malignancies. Perhaps best exemplified in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and JAK2, have dramatically changed outcomes in persons with MPN. However, clinically relevant dosing of these adenosine triphosphate-mimetic agents in humans leads to inhibition of numerous tyrosine kinases beyond those touted by drug manufacturers and studied in landmark clinical trials. These so-called off-target effects have been linked to both clinical efficacy and toxicity. Rational drug development and serendipitous discovery of drug molecules allows the clinician to select targeted oncolytic agents to treat a specific clinical diagnosis and/or avoid exacerbation of concomitant disease states due to effects upon signaling pathways. Understanding the off-target binding and effects upon signaling pathway of the agents approved for the treatment of MPN will empower the clinician to adroitly select pharmacotherapy, predict toxicities, and utilize these agents in clinical practice for indications beyond MPN.",,,,2013-12-20,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We sought to identify patient risk factors for default from MDR-TB treatment and high-risk time periods for default in relation to hospitalization and transition to outpatient care.
We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 225 patients who initiated MDR-TB treatment between 2007 through 2010 at a rural TB hospital in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.
Fifty percent of patients were cured or completed treatment, 27% defaulted, 14% died, 4% failed treatment, and 5% transferred out. Recent alcohol use was common (63% of patients). In multivariable proportional hazards regression, older age (hazard ratio [HR]= 0.97 [95% confidence interval 0.94-0.99] per year of greater age), formal housing (HR=0.38 [0.19-0.78]), and steady employment (HR=0.41 [0.19-0.90]) were associated with decreased risk of default, while recent alcohol use (HR=2.1 [1.1-4.0]), recent drug use (HR=2.0 [1.0-3.6]), and Coloured (mixed ancestry) ethnicity (HR=2.3 [1.1-5.0]) were associated with increased risk of default (P<0.05).

24349420,Elucidating emergence and transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in treatment experienced patients by whole genome sequencing.,,PloS one,"Understanding the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is crucial for its control. MDR-TB in previously treated patients is generally attributed to the selection of drug resistant mutants during inadequate therapy rather than transmission of a resistant strain. Traditional genotyping methods are not sufficient to distinguish strains in populations with a high burden of tuberculosis and it has previously been difficult to assess the degree of transmission in these settings. We have used whole genome analysis to investigate M. tuberculosis strains isolated from treatment experienced patients with MDR-TB in Uganda over a period of four years.
We used high throughput genome sequencing technology to investigate small polymorphisms and large deletions in 51 Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples from 41 treatment-experienced TB patients attending a TB referral and treatment clinic in Kampala. This was a convenience sample representing 69% of MDR-TB cases identified over the four year period. Low polymorphism was observed in longitudinal samples from individual patients (2-15 SNPs). Clusters of samples with less than 50 SNPs variation were examined. Three clusters comprising a total of 8 patients were found with almost identical genetic profiles, including mutations predictive for resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, suggesting transmission of MDR-TB. Two patients with previous drug susceptible disease were found to have acquired MDR strains, one of which shared its genotype with an isolate from another patient in the cohort.
Whole genome sequence analysis identified MDR-TB strains that were shared by more than one patient. The transmission of multidrug-resistant disease in this cohort of retreatment patients emphasises the importance of early detection and need for infection control. Consideration should be given to rapid testing for drug resistance in patients undergoing treatment to monitor the emergence of resistance and permit early intervention to avoid onward transmission.",,,,2013-12-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

However, there is little information available on risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with MDR- and XDR-TB in China.
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of HIV-negative TB Patients with culture-proven MDR- or XDR-TB who were registered from July 2006 to June 2011 at five large-scale Tuberculosis Specialized Hospitals in China. Among 1662 HIV-seronegative TB cases which were culture-positive for M. tuberculosis complex and had positive sputum-smear microscopy results, 965 cases (58.1%) were DR-TB, and 586 cases (35.3%) were classified as having MDR-TB, accounting for 60.7% of DR-TB. 169 cases (10.2%) were XDR-TB, accounting for 17.5% of DR-TB, 28.8% of MDR-TB. The MDR-TB patients were divided into XDR-TB group (n=169) and other MDR-TB group (non-XDR MDR-TB) (n=417). In total, 240 patients (40.95%) had treatment success, and 346 (59.05%) had poor treatment outcomes. The treatment success rate in other MDR-TB group was 52.2%, significantly higher than that in the XDR-TB group (13%, P<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, poor outcomes were associated with duration of previous anti-TB treatment of more than one year (OR, 0.077; 95% CI, 0.011-0.499, P<0.001), a BMI less than 18.5 kg/m(2) (OR, 2.185; 95% CI, 1.372-3.478, P<0.001), XDR (OR, 13.368; 95% CI, 6.745-26.497, P<0.001), retreatment (OR, 0.171; 95% CI, 0.093-0.314, P<0.001), diabetes (OR, 0.305; 95% CI, 0.140-0.663, P=0.003), tumor (OR, 0.095; 95% CI, 0.011-0.795, P=0.03), decreased albumin (OR, 0.181; 95% CI, 0.118-0.295, P<0.001), cavitation (OR, 0.175; 95% CI, 0.108-0.286, P<0.001).

In the light of the inconsistent efficacy imparted by the only currently available pre-exposure vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin BCG, the development of an improved TB vaccine is a very high international research priority. Vaccine candidates currently in clinical trials are also pre-exposure vaccines that aim to prevent active tuberculosis during an individual's lifetime. According to World Health Organization approximately a third of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Dormancy or latency of Mycobacteria is associated with the formation of granuloma with poorly perfused interior leading to expression of genes which help them survive in this hostile environment. A group of about 50 genes belonging to the DosR regulon also known as latency antigens are expressed by Mycobacteria when they are persisting in the immuno-competent host. An understanding of the immunological effects produced by products of these latency induced genes may help in making a more potent vaccine. Incorporation of latency antigens into improved (live or subunit) vaccines may enhance the impact of these vaccines in which BCG priming can be followed by multisubunit protein boosting. These vaccines could act as post exposure vaccines for containment and prevention of latent TB activation. This heterologous boosting of BCG-primed immunity will be able to stimulate the known immune correlates of protective immunity against M. tuberculosis i.e. TH1 cells (CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells) mediated immune responses with cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α⋅ In our review we have analysed and compared the immunogenic potential of various latency-associated antigens of the DosR regulon in line with the current strategy of developing a recombinant post exposure booster vaccine.",,,,2013-12-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

A search of PubMed (January 2004-May 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (January 2004-May 2013) using the search terms bedaquiline, diarylquinoline, R207910, and TMC207 was performed. Supplementary sources included proceedings of the Union World Conference on Lung Health.
Preclinical data as well as Phase 1 and 2 studies published in English were evaluated.
Bedaquiline possesses a unique mechanism of action that disrupts the activity of the mycobacterial adenosine triphosphate synthase. Clinical trials have been conducted evaluating the use of bedaquiline in combination with a background regimen for the treatment of adults with pulmonary MDR-TB. Bedaquiline has an excellent in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including multidrug resistant M tuberculosis; however, its side effect profile limits its use against MDR-TB when no other effective regimen can be provided. Bedaquiline carries Black Box warnings for increased risk of unexplained mortality and QT prolongation. Bedaquiline is metabolized via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme and thus interacts with rifamycins and several antiretrovirals.

24245762,QSAR based design of new antitubercular compounds: improved isoniazid derivatives against multidrug-resistant TB.,,Current pharmaceutical design,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the second cause of death from a single infectious agent, the M. tuberculosis bacillus. Nearly two billion people are infected and about 8.7 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths were reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013. Despite the availability of effective treatment, the alarming emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains (with 310.000 estimated cases in 2011 among notified patients with pulmonary TB), simultaneously resistant to the two most effective anti-TB drugs, isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin, has urged the need to develop new molecular scaffolds, either structurally original or based on old and active drugs. The aim of this review is to summarize the current status of different QSAR based strategies for the design of novel anti-TB drugs based upon the most active anti-TB agent known, INH. A case study puts in evidence that the judicious application of quantitative structure- activity relationships can be successfully used to rationally design new INH-based derivatives, active against INH-resistant strains harboring mutations in the most frequent resistance related target (katG), and therefore develop candidate-compounds against MDR-TB, thus revisiting the unique effectiveness of INH against TB.",,,,2013-11-20,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24245755,Editorial: Current status and perspective on drug targets in tubercle bacilli and drug design of antituberculous agents based on structure-activity relationship.,,Current pharmaceutical design,"Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) remains the most frequent and important infectious disease causing morbidity and death. However, the development of new drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of TB, particularly those truly active against dormant and persistent types of tubercle bacilli, has been slow, although some promising drugs, such as diarylquinoline TMC207, nitroimidazopyran PA-824, nitroimidazo-oxazole Delamanid (OPC-67683), oxazolidinone PNU-100480, ethylene diamine SQ-109, and pyrrole derivative LL3858, are currently under phase 1 to 3 clinical trials. Therefore, novel types of antituberculous drug, which act on unique drug targets in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) pathogens, particularly drug targets related to the establishment of mycobacterial dormancy in the host's macrophages, are urgently needed. In this context, it should be noted that current anti-TB drugs mostly target the metabolic reactions and proteins which are essential for the growth of MTB in extracellular milieus. It may also be promising to develop another type of drug that exerts an inhibitory action against bacterial virulence factors which cross-talk and interfere with signaling pathways of MTB-infected immunocompetent host cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and NK cells, thereby changing the intracellular milieus that are favorable to intramacrophage survival and the growth of infected bacilli. This special issue contains ten review articles, dealing with recent approaches to identify and establish novel drug targets in MTB for the development of new and unique antitubercular drugs, including those related to mycobacterial dormancy and crosstalk with cellular signaling pathways. In addition, this special issue contains some review papers with special reference to the drug design based on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, especially three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR. New, critical information on the entire genome of MTB and mycobacterial virulence genes is promoting the elucidation of the molecular structures of drug targets in MTB, and are consequently markedly useful for the design of new, promising antituberculous drugs using QSAR techniques. In this issue, we review the following areas. Firstly, Dr. Li M. Fu reviews the perspective that combines machine learning and genomics for drug discovery in tuberculosis, in relation to the problem that the exhaustive search for useful drug targets over the entire MTB genome would not be as productive as expected in practice [1]. Secondly, the review article by Drs. R. S. Chauhan. S. K. Chanumolu, C. Rout, and R. Shrivastava focuses on analysis of the current state of MTB genomic resources, host-pathogen interaction studies in the context of mycobacterial persistence, and drug target discovery based on the utilization of computational tools and metabolic network analyses [2]. Thirdly, Drs. Daria Bottai, Agnese Serafini, Alessandro Cascioferro, Roland Brosch, and Riccardo Manganelli review the current knowledge on MTB T7SS/ESX secretion systems and their impact on MTB physiology and virulence, and the possible approaches to develop T7SS/ESX inhibitors [3]. Fourthly, Drs. E. Jeffrey North, Mary Jackson, and Richard E. Lee review and analyze new and emerging inhibitors of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway, including mycobacterial enzymes for fatty acid synthesis, mycolic acid-modifying enzymes, fatty acid-activating and -condensing enzymes, transporters, and transferases, that have been discovered in the post-genomic era of tuberculosis drug discovery [4]. Fifthly, Drs. Katarina Mikusova, Vadim Makarov, and Joao Neres review the mycobacterial enzyme DprE1, which catalyzes a unique epimerization reaction in the biosynthesis of decaprenylphosphoryl arabinose, a single donor of the arabinosyl residue for the build-up of arabinans, one of the mycobacterial cell wall components, as an important drug target especially for the development of benzothiazinones [5]. Sixthly, I review the present status of global research on novel drug targets related to the Toll-like receptor in the MTB pathogen, with special reference to mycobacterial virulence factors that cross-talk and interfere with signaling pathways of host macrophages [6]. The following four review articles deal with drug design of novel anti-TB agents employing QSAR techniques. Firstly, Drs. Nidhi and Mohammad Imran Siddiqi review 2D and 3D QSAR approaches and the recent trends of these methods integrated with virtual screening using the 3D pharmacophore and molecular docking approaches for the identification and design of novel antituberculous agents, by presenting a comprehensive overview of QSAR studies reported for newer antituberculous agents [7]. Secondly, Drs. Filomena Martins, Cristina Ventura, Susana Santos, and Miguel Viveiros review the current status of different QSAR-based strategies for the design of novel anti-TB drugs based upon the most active anti-TB agent, isoniazid, from the viewpoint of the development of promising derivatives that are active against isoniazid- resistant strains with katG mutations [8]. Thirdly, Drs. Sanchaita Rajkhowa and Ramesh C. Deka review current studies concerning 2D and 3D QSAR models that contain density-functional theory (DFT)-based descriptors as their parameters [9]. Notably, DFT-based descriptors such as atomic charges, molecular orbital energies, frontier orbital densities, and atom-atom polarizabilities are very useful in predicting the reactivity of atoms in molecules. Fourthly, Drs. Renata V. Bueno, Rodolpho C. Braga, Natanael D. Segretti, Elizabeth I. Ferreira, Gustavo H. G. Trossini, and Carolina H. Andrade review the current progress and applications of QSAR analysis for the discovery of innovative tuberculostatic agents as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase, DNA gyrase, ATP synthase, and thymidylate kinase enzymes, highlighting present challenges and new opportunities in TB drug design [10]. The aim of this issue is to address the future prospects for the development of new antituberculous drugs. There are a number of difficulties in computational drug-design for the development of new drug formulations with potential antimycobacterial effects, especially therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against infection due to dormant-type MTB pathogens. In addition, it should be emphasized that the most urgent goal of TB chemotherapy is develop highly active, low-cost drugs which can be used not only in industrialized but also in developing countries, because most global TB incidence occurs in the latter. I am sincerely grateful to the individuals who contributed to this work. All authors are experts in their fields and they made earnest efforts to perform these in-depth reviews.

24236723,Filling the pipeline - new drugs for an old disease.,,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,"Tuberculosis is a major global health problem. In the middle of the last century several laboratories identified, developed and synthesized several substances which were active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the disease. In the 1980s the standard oral treatment regimen was introduced with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. In combination with the DOTS strategy it was possible treat TB within 6-8 months. But with the emergence of drug resistant strains, the formerly successful regiment became ineffective for MDR and XDR TB patients. Even more alarming, the rapidly increasing HIV epidemic also increases the number of HIV-related TB. Facing these facts, it became evident that novel strategies and antibiotics were needed to treat the new forms of TB. But over the last 60 years no novel TB drug was developed or even in the drug pipeline. But during the last ten years several novel substances have been developed to combat the deadly disease. For the first time in decades the TB drug pipeline is filled again with several promising compounds and many of them have reached Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Several laboratories and companies all over the world currently are developing and evaluating these substances. This review presents novel substances, which were for the first time exclusively developed for TB such as bedaquilines, nitroimidazoles and the diamine SQ109.

There is an urgent need for new agents with improved efficacy, safety, and compatibility with combination chemotherapies. Oxazolidinones offer a potential new class of TB drugs, and linezolid-the only currently approved oxazolidinone-has proven highly effective against extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in experimental trials. However, widespread use of linezolid is prohibited by its significant toxicities. AZD5847, a novel oxazolidinone, demonstrates improved in vitro bactericidal activity against both extracellular and intracellular M. tuberculosis compared to that of linezolid. Killing kinetics in broth media and in macrophages indicate that the rate and extent of kill obtained with AZD5847 are superior to those obtained with linezolid. Moreover, the efficacy of AZD5847 was additive when tested along with a variety of conventional TB agents, indicating that AZD5847 may function well in combination therapies. AZD5847 appears to function similarly to linezolid through impairment of the mycobacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. Future studies should be undertaken to further characterize the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of AZD5847 in both in vitro and animal models as well is in human clinical trials.",,,,2013-11-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The MIC distributions of ofloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined for 197 drug-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For a specific MIC, the probability of target attainment (PTA) was determined for target fAUC0-24/MIC ratios of ≥53 and ≥100. The PTAs were combined with the MIC distributions to calculate the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Even with the less stringent target ratio of ≥53, moxifloxacin at 400 mg and ofloxacin at 800 mg achieved CFRs of only 84% and 58% for multidrug-resistant isolates with resistance to an injectable drug, while the 800-mg moxifloxacin dose achieved a CFR of 98%. Using a target ratio of ≥100 for multidrug-resistant strains (without resistance to injectable agents or fluoroquinolones), the CFR was 88% for moxifloxacin and only 43% for ofloxacin, and the higher dose of 800 mg moxifloxacin was needed to achieve a CFR target of >90%. Our results indicate that moxifloxacin is more efficacious than ofloxacin in the treatment of MDR-TB. Further studies should determine the optimal pharmacodynamic target for moxifloxacin in a multidrug regimen and clarify safety issues when it is administered at higher doses.",,,,2013-11-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
24176144,"Feasibility, accuracy, and clinical effect of point-of-care Xpert MTB/RIF testing for tuberculosis in primary-care settings in Africa: a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial.",,"Lancet (London, England)","The Xpert MTB/RIF test for tuberculosis is being rolled out in many countries, but evidence is lacking regarding its implementation outside laboratories, ability to inform same-day treatment decisions at the point of care, and clinical effect on tuberculosis-related morbidity. We aimed to assess the feasibility, accuracy, and clinical effect of point-of-care Xpert MTB/RIF testing at primary-care health-care facilities in southern Africa.
In this pragmatic, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre trial, we recruited adults with symptoms suggestive of active tuberculosis from five primary-care health-care facilities in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Tanzania. Eligible patients were randomly assigned using pregenerated tables to nurse-performed Xpert MTB/RIF at the clinic or sputum smear microscopy. Participants with a negative test result were empirically managed according to local WHO-compliant guidelines. Our primary outcome was tuberculosis-related morbidity (measured with the TBscore and Karnofsky performance score [KPS]) in culture-positive patients who had begun anti-tuberculosis treatment, measured at 2 months and 6 months after randomisation, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01554384.
Between April 12, 2011, and March 30, 2012, we randomly assigned 758 patients to smear microscopy (182 culture positive) and 744 to Xpert MTB/RIF (185 culture positive). Median TBscore in culture-positive patients did not differ between groups at 2 months (2 [IQR 0-3] in the smear microscopy group vs 2 [0·25-3] in the MTB/RIF group; p=0·85) or 6 months (1 [0-3] vs 1 [0-3]; p=0·35), nor did median KPS at 2 months (80 [70-90] vs 90 [80-90]; p=0·23) or 6 months (100 [90-100] vs 100 [90-100]; p=0·85). Point-of-care MTB/RIF had higher sensitivity than microscopy (154 [83%] of 185 vs 91 [50%] of 182; p=0·0001) but similar specificity (517 [95%] 544 vs 540 [96%] of 560; p=0·25), and had similar sensitivity to laboratory-based MTB/RIF (292 [83%] of 351; p=0·99) but higher specificity (952 [92%] of 1037; p=0·0173). 34 (5%) of 744 tests with point-of-care MTB/RIF and 82 (6%) of 1411 with laboratory-based MTB/RIF failed (p=0·22). Compared with the microscopy group, more patients in the MTB/RIF group had a same-day diagnosis (178 [24%] of 744 vs 99 [13%] of 758; p<0·0001) and same-day treatment initiation (168 [23%] of 744 vs 115 [15%] of 758; p=0·0002). Although, by end of the study, more culture-positive patients in the MTB/RIF group were on treatment due to reduced dropout (15 [8%] of 185 in the MTB/RIF group did not receive treatment vs 28 [15%] of 182 in the microscopy group; p=0·0302), the proportions of all patients on treatment in each group by day 56 were similar (320 [43%] of 744 in the MTB/RIF group vs 317 [42%] of 758 in the microscopy group; p=0·6408).
Xpert MTB/RIF can be accurately administered by a nurse in primary-care clinics, resulting in more patients starting same-day treatment, more culture-positive patients starting therapy, and a shorter time to treatment. However, the benefits did not translate into lower tuberculosis-related morbidity, partly because of high levels of empirical-evidence-based treatment in smear-negative patients.

24157696,Provisional CDC guidelines for the use and safety monitoring of bedaquiline fumarate (Sirturo) for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,MMWR. Recommendations and reports : Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Recommendations and reports,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most effective of the four first-line TB drugs (the other two drugs being ethambutol and pyrazinamide). MDR TB includes the subcategory of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB), which is MDR TB with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone and to at least one of three injectable anti-TB drugs (i.e., kanamycin, capreomycin, or amikacin). MDR TB is difficult to cure, requiring 18-24 months of treatment after sputum culture conversion with a regimen that consists of four to six medications with toxic side effects, and carries a mortality risk greater than that of drug-susceptible TB. Bedaquiline fumarate (Sirturo or bedaquiline) is an oral diarylquinoline. On December 28, 2012, on the basis of data from two Phase IIb trials (i.e., well-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs in patients with a disease or condition to be treated, diagnosed, or prevented), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of bedaquiline under the provisions of the accelerated approval regulations for ""serious or life-threatening illnesses"" (21CFR314.500) (Cox EM. FDA accelerated approval letter to Janssen Research and Development. Available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2012/204384Orig1s000ltr.pdf). This report provides provisional CDC guidelines for FDA-approved and unapproved, or off-label, uses of bedaquiline in certain populations, such as children, pregnant women, or persons with extrapulmonary MDR TB who were not included in the clinical trials for the drug. CDC's Division of TB Elimination developed these guidelines on the basis of expert opinion informed by data from systematic reviews and literature searches. This approach is different from the statutory standards that FDA uses when approving drugs and drug labeling. These guidelines are intended for health-care professionals who might use bedaquiline for the treatment of MDR TB for indicated and off-label uses. Aspects of these guidelines are not identical to current FDA-approved labeling for bedaquiline. Bedaquiline should be used with clinical expert consultation as part of combination therapy (minimum four-drug treatment regimen) and administered by direct observation to adults aged ≥18 years with a diagnosis of pulmonary MDR TB (Food and Drug Administration. SIRTURO [bedaquiline] tablets label. Available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/204384s000lbl.pdf). Use of the drug also can be considered for individual patients in other categories (e.g., persons with extrapulmonary TB, children, pregnant women, or persons with HIV or other comorbid conditions) when treatment options are limited. However, further study is required before routine use of bedaquiline can be recommended in these populations. A registry for persons treated with bedaquiline is being implemented by Janssen Therapeutics to track patient outcomes, adverse reactions, laboratory testing results (e.g., diagnosis, drug susceptibility, and development of drug resistance), use of concomitant medications, and presence of other comorbid conditions. Suspected adverse reactions (i.e., any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event) and serious adverse events (i.e., any adverse event that results in an outcome such as death, hospitalization, permanent disability, or a life-threatening situation) should be reported to Janssen Therapeutics at telephone 1-800-526-7736, to FDA at telephone 1-800-332-1088 or at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch, and to CDC's Emergency Operations Center at telephone 1-770-488-7100.",,,,2013-10-26,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

24100880,Pipeline of drugs for related diseases: tuberculosis.,,Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,"For the first time in decades, there are multiple new drugs in the pipeline for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). In addition, existing drugs are being repurposed or optimized for TB with the goal of shortened treatment duration for drug-sensitive TB and safer, shorter treatments for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. In this review, the results of recent trials evaluating novel combination regimens for TB disease and latent TB infection are described.
High-dose rifamycins (rifampin and rifapentine) and fluoroquinolones directly observed have treatment-shortening potential when used for drug-sensitive TB disease, and a 12-dose once-weekly regimen of rifapentine along with isoniazid effectively treats latent TB. Bedaquiline, an anti-TB drug with a novel mechanism of action, and delamanid, a nitroimidazole, are entering phase 3 trials. Both improve rates of sputum culture conversion among patients with MDR-TB. Other nitroimidazoles and oxazolidinones are in Phase 2 testing, as are combinations involving multiple new chemical entities.
With the resurgence of anti-TB drug discovery efforts, we now have a modestly robust pipeline of new anti-TB drugs. Several promising new regimens involving investigational and existing drugs that may be capable of shortening treatment for drug-sensitive TB and improving management of drug-resistant TB are in late-phase clinical evaluation.",,,,2013-10-09,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Compared to what was reported in previous surveys, a surprising number of new agents are currently in company pipelines, particularly in phase 3 clinical development. Familiar antibacterial classes of the quinolones, tetracyclines, oxazolidinones, glycopeptides, and cephalosporins are represented by entities with enhanced antimicrobial or pharmacological properties. More importantly, compounds of novel chemical structures targeting bacterial pathways not previously exploited are under development. Some of the most promising compounds include novel β-lactamase inhibitor combinations that target many multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, a critical medical need.

24082790,The use of platensimycin and platencin to fight antibiotic resistance.,"antibiotics, bacterial infections, drug resistance, platencin, platensimycin",Infection and drug resistance,"Infectious diseases are known as one of the most life-threatening disabilities worldwide. Approximately 13 million deaths related to infectious diseases are reported each year. The only way to combat infectious diseases is by chemotherapy using antimicrobial agents and antibiotics. However, due to uncontrolled and unnecessary use of antibiotics in particular, surviving bacteria have evolved resistance against several antibiotics. Emergence of multidrug resistance in bacteria over the past several decades has resulted in one of the most important clinical health problems in modern medicine. For instance, approximately 440,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are reported every year leading to the deaths of 150,000 people worldwide. Management of multidrug resistance requires understanding its molecular basis and the evolution and dissemination of resistance; development of new antibiotic compounds in place of traditional antibiotics; and innovative strategies for extending the life of antibiotic molecules. Researchers have begun to develop new antimicrobials for overcoming this important problem. Recently, platensimycin - isolated from extracts of Streptomyces platensis - and its analog platencin have been defined as promising agents for fighting multidrug resistance. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that these new antimicrobials have great potential to inhibit methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae by targeting type II fatty acid synthesis in bacteria. Showing strong efficacy without any observed in vivo toxicity increases the significance of these antimicrobial agents for their use in humans. However, at the present time, clinical trials are insufficient and require more research. The strong antibacterial efficacies of platensimycin and platencin may be established in clinical trials and their use in humans for coping with multidrug resistance may be allowed in the foreseeable future.",,,,2013-10-02,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23988774,Potential antimicrobial agents for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,The European respiratory journal,"Treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is challenging because of the high toxicity of second-line drugs and the longer treatment duration than for drug-susceptible TB patients. In order to speed up novel treatment for MDR-TB, we suggest considering expanding the indications of already available drugs. Six drugs with antimicrobial activity (phenothiazine, metronidazole, doxycycline, disulfiram, tigecycline and co-trimoxazole) are not listed in the World Health Organization guidelines on MDR-TB treatment but could be potential candidates for evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate antituberculous activity of these drugs against M. tuberculosis. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Embase for English articles published up to December 31, 2012. We reviewed in vitro, in vivo and clinical antituberculous activity of these drugs in addition to pharmacokinetics and side-effects. Of the drugs effective against actively replicating M. tuberculosis, co-trimoxazole seems to be the most promising, because of its consistent pharmacokinetic profile, easy penetration into tissue and safety profile. For the dormant state of TB, thioridazine may play a potential role as an adjuvant for treatment of MDR-TB.

23935905,In vitro characterization of the anti-bacterial activity of SQ109 against Helicobacter pylori.,,PloS one,"The most evident challenge to treatment of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium responsible for gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer, is the increasing rate of resistance to all currently used therapeutic antibiotics. Thus, the development of novel therapies is urgently required. N-geranyl-N'-(2-adamantyl) ethane-1, 2-diamine (SQ109) is an ethylene diamine-based antitubercular drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Previous pharmacokinetic studies of SQ109 revealed that persistently high concentrations of SQ109 remain in the stomach 4 hours post oral administration in rats. This finding, combined with the need for new anti-Helicobacter therapies, prompted us to define the in vitro efficacy of SQ109 against H. pylori. Liquid broth micro-dilution was used for susceptibility studies to determine the antimicrobial activity of SQ109 against a total of 6 laboratory strains and 20 clinical isolates of H. pylori; the clinical isolates included a multi-drug resistant strain. All strains tested were susceptible to SQ109 with MIC and MBC ranges of 6-10 µM and 50-60 µM, respectively. SQ109 killing kinetics were concentration- and time-dependent. SQ109 killed H. pylori in 8-10 h at 140 µM (2MBCs) or 4-6 h at 200 µM (~3MBCs). Importantly, though the kinetics of killing were altered, SQ109 retained potent bactericidal activity against H. pylori at low pH. Additionally, SQ109 demonstrated robust thermal stability and was effective at killing slow growing or static bacteria. In fact, pretreatment of cultures with a bacteriostatic concentration of chloramphenicol (Cm) synergized the effects of typically bacteriostatic concentrations of SQ109 to the level of five-logs of bacterial killing. A molar-to-molar comparison of the efficacy of SQ109 as compared to metronidazole (MTZ), amoxicillin (AMX), rifampicin (RIF) and clarithromycin (CLR), revealed that SQ109 was superior to MTZ, AMX and RIF but not to CLR. Finally, the frequency of resistance to SQ109 was low and electron microscopy studies revealed that SQ109 interacted with bacterial inner membrane and cytoplasmic content(s). Collectively, our in vitro data demonstrate that SQ109 is an effective monotherapy against susceptible and multi-drug resistant strains of H. pylori and may be useful alone or in combination with other antibiotics for development as a new class of anti-Helicobacter drugs.",,,,2013-08-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

However, studies comparing the effectiveness of LFX and MXF among patients with MDR-TB are lacking.
To compare the effectiveness of LFX and MXF in terms of culture conversion after 3 months of treatment for MDR-TB.
In this prospective multicenter randomized open label trial, we randomly assigned 182 patients with MDR-TB (sensitive to LFX and MXF) to receive either LFX (750 mg/day; 90 patients) or MXF (400 mg/day; 92 patients) with a background drug regimen. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who achieved sputum culture conversion at 3 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes were time to culture conversion and time to smear conversion, with data censored at 3 months, and the proportions of adverse drug reactions.
At 3 months of treatment, 68 (88.3%) of the 77 patients in the LFX group and 67 (90.5%) of the 74 in the MXF group showed conversion to negative sputum cultures (odds ratio for LFX compared with MXF, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-2.20). Adverse drug reactions were reported in six patients (7.7%) in the LFX group and four (5.2%) in the MXF group (P = 0.75).

The primary outcome of the overall trial will be HIV incidence over two years. Secondary outcomes will include i) socio-behavioural outcomes (acceptability of repeat HIV counselling and testing, treatment acceptance and linkage to care, sexual partnerships and quality of life); ii) clinical outcomes (mortality and morbidity, retention into care, adherence to ART, virologic failure and acquired HIV drug resistance), iii) cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Among them, tuberculosis (TB), produced by M. tuberculosiscomplex bacteria, is historically the single most devastating infectious agent. Like many other microorganisms, M. tuberculosis resistant to antibiotics have risen as a consequence of selective pressure for mutants able to persist despite being attacked with drugs that would otherwise erradicate them from the infected person. Given the current long-term (6-9 months) therapy with multiple antibiotics, many people abandon their treatments, therefore promoting that bacteria that were not eliminated during therapy get exposed to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations, probably leading to mutations and drug resistance. In this scenario, extremely-drug resistant (XDR) TB was recognized not more than a decade ago, prompting concerns for a more complicated drug regimen with few available molecules. In recent years, either old antibiotics have been rediscovered as good measures to control XDR-TB, or new ones have emerged as alternatives to cure patients of this type of infection.

This paper presents data from a prematurely terminated randomized clinical trial, of 4-month moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin regimens, in South India.
Newly diagnosed, sputum-positive HIV-negative pulmonary TB patients were randomly allocated to receive gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin, along with isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months with pyrazinamide for first 2 months (G or M) or isoniazid and rifampicin for 6 months with ethambutol and pyrazinamide for first 2 months (C). All regimens were administered thrice-weekly. Clinical and bacteriological assessments were done monthly during treatment and for 24 months post-treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended termination of the trial due to high TB recurrence rates in the G and M regimens.
Of 416 patients in intent-to-treat analysis, 6 (5%) of 124, 2 (2%) of 110 and 2 (2%) of 137 patients with drug-susceptible TB in the G, M and C arms respectively had unfavorable response at the end of treatment; during the next 24 months, 17 (15%) of 115, 11 (11%) of 104 and 8 (6%) of 132 patients respectively, had TB recurrence. Of 38 drug-resistant patients 1 of 8 and 3 of 26 in the G and C arms respectively had unfavourable response at the end of treatment; and TB recurrence occurred in 2 of 7 and 2 of 23 patients, respectively. The differences in TB recurrence rates between the G and C arms was statistically significant (p = 0.02).

23777736,Preventing nosocomial MDR TB transmission in sub Saharan Africa: where are we at?,,Global journal of health science,"In sub Saharan Africa, the cocktail of many advanced HIV-infected susceptible hosts, poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing (DST) have resulted in HIV-infected individuals being  disproportionately represented in Multi drug resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. The prevailing application of the WHO re-treatment protocol indiscriminately to all re-treatment cases sets the stage for an increase in mortality and MDR-TB nosocomial transmission.
A comprehensive search was performed of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register and Medline database including the bibliographies of the retrieved reference.
The TB diagnosis paradigm which for decades relied on smear sputum and culture is likely to change with the advent of the point-of-care diagnostic, Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Until the new DST infrastructure is available, along with clinical trials for both, current and new approaches to retreatment TB in areas heavily affected by HIV and TB, there are cost effective administrative, environmental, and protective measures that may be immediately instituted.
The severe lack of infection control practices in sub Saharan Africa may jeopardise the recent strides in MDR-TB management. Cost effective infection control measures must be immediately implemented, otherwise the development of further drug resistance may offset recent strides in MDR-TB management. Indiscriminate use of the WHO standardized retreatment protocol can lead to nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB by: -Precluding early diagnosis and prompt separation of patients who experienced treatment failure category and thereby more likely to have MDR-TB. -Leaving patients from the treatment failure category in health establishments on ineffective standard retreatment regimen until the DST results are known. -targeting only patients who have had prior TB therapy, new severely debilitated TB patients having primary unrecognized MDR-TB may continue spreading resistant organisms.",A comprehensive search was performed of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register and Medline database including the bibliographies of the retrieved reference.,,"The severe lack of infection control practices in sub Saharan Africa may jeopardise the recent strides in MDR-TB management.

New molecular diagnostics, such as the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay, have the potential to improve patient outcomes. We present a cluster randomised trial designed to evaluate whether the positioning of this diagnostic system within the health system has an impact on important patient-level outcomes.
This pragmatic cluster randomised clinical trial compared two positioning strategies for the Xpert MTB/RIF system: centralised laboratory versus primary health care clinic. The cluster (unit of randomisation) is a 2-week time block at the trial clinic. Adult pulmonary tuberculosis suspects with confirmed human immunodeficiency virus infection and/or at high risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are enrolled from the primary health care clinic. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis cases initiated on appropriate treatment within 30 days of initial clinic visit. Univariate logistic regression will be performed as the primary analysis using generalised estimating equations with a binomial distribution function and a logit link.
Diagnostic research tends to focus only on performance of diagnostic tests rather than on patient-important outcomes. This trial has been designed to improve the quality of evidence around diagnostic strategies and to inform the scale-up of new tuberculosis diagnostics within public health systems in high-burden settings.

However, use of fluoroquinolones could shorten the length of treatment and improve other outcomes in these people. This review summarises the effects of fluoroquinolones in first-line regimens in people with presumed drug-sensitive TB.
To assess fluoroquinolones as substitute or additional components in antituberculous drug regimens for drug-sensitive TB.
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; Science Citation Index; Databases of Russian Publications; and metaRegister of Controlled Trials up to 6 March 2013.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antituberculous regimens based on rifampicin and pyrazinamide and containing fluoroquinolones in people with presumed drug-sensitive pulmonary TB.
Two authors independently applied inclusion criteria, assessed the risk of bias in the trials, and extracted data. We used the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and the fixed-effect model when it was appropriate to combine data and no heterogeneity was present. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.
We identified five RCTs (1330 participants) that met the inclusion criteria. None of the included trials examined regimens of less than six months duration. Fluoroquinolones added to standard regimensA single trial (174 participants) added levofloxacin to the standard first-line regimen. Relapse and treatment failure were not reported. For death, sputum conversion, and adverse events we are uncertain if there is an effect (one trial, 174 participants, very low quality evidence for all three outcomes). Fluoroquinolones substituted for ethambutol in standard regimens Three trials (723 participants) substituted ethambutol with moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and ofloxacin into the standard first-line regimen. For relapse, we are uncertain if there is an effect (one trial, 170 participants, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on treatment failure. For death, sputum culture conversion at eight weeks, or serious adverse events we do not know if there was an effect (three trials, 723 participants, very low quality evidence for all three outcomes). Fluoroquinolones substituted for isoniazid in standard regimens A single trial (433 participants) substituted moxifloxacin for isoniazid. Treatment failure and relapse were not reported. For death, sputum culture conversion, or serious adverse events the substitution may have little or no difference (one trial, 433 participants, low quality evidence for all three outcomes). Fluoroquinolines in four month regimensSix trials are currently in progress testing shorter regimens with fluoroquinolones.
Ofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin have been tested in RCTs of standard first-line regimens based on rifampicin and pyrazinamide for treating drug-sensitive TB. There is insufficient evidence to be clear whether addition or substitution of fluoroquinolones for ethambutol or isoniazid in the first-line regimen reduces death or relapse, or increases culture conversion at eight weeks. Much larger trials with fluoroquinolones in short course regimens of four months are currently in progress.",,,,2013-06-08,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We compared the sterilizing activity of the standard first-line antitubercular regimen, rifampin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide (RHZ), with that of the novel regimen PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide (PaMZ), which is currently being studied in clinical trials (NCT01498419), in the guinea pig model of chronic TB infection, in which animals develop necrotic granulomas histologically resembling their human counterparts. Guinea pigs were aerosol infected with ~2 log10 bacilli of wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, and antibiotic treatment was initiated 6 weeks after infection. Separate groups of animals received RHZ, PaMZ, or single or two-drug components of the latter regimen administered at human-equivalent doses 5 days/week for a total of 8 weeks. Relapse rates were assessed 3 months after discontinuation of treatment to determine the sterilizing activity of each combination regimen. PaMZ given at human-equivalent doses was safe and well tolerated for the entire treatment period and rendered guinea pig lungs culture negative more rapidly than RHZ did. After 1 month of treatment, 80% and 50% of animals in the RHZ and PaMZ groups, respectively, had lung culture-positive relapse. Both combination regimens prevented microbiological relapse when administered for a total of 2 months. Our data support the use of PaMZ as a novel isoniazid- and rifamycin-sparing regimen suitable for treatment of both drug-sensitive TB and MDR-TB.",,,,2013-06-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23733467,Efficacy and safety of metronidazole for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Pulmonary lesions from active tuberculosis patients are thought to contain persistent, nonreplicating bacilli that arise from hypoxic stress. Metronidazole, approved for anaerobic infections, has antituberculosis activity against anoxic bacilli in vitro and in some animal models and may target persistent, nonreplicating bacilli. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis subjects were randomly assigned to receive metronidazole (500 mg thrice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks in addition to an individualized background regimen. Outcomes were measured radiologically (change on high-resolution computed tomography [HRCT]), microbiologically (time to sputum smear and culture conversion), and clinically (status 6 months after stopping therapy). Enrollment was stopped early due to excessive peripheral neuropathies in the metronidazole arm. Among 35 randomized subjects, 31 (15 metronidazole, 16 placebo) were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. There were no significant differences by arm in improvement of HRCT lesions from baseline to 2 or 6 months. More subjects in the metronidazole arm converted their sputum smear (P = 0.04) and liquid culture (P = 0.04) to negative at 1 month, but these differences were lost by 2 months. Overall, 81% showed clinical success 6 months after stopping therapy, with no differences by arm. However, 8/16 (50%) of subjects in the metronidazole group and 2/17 (12%) of those in the placebo group developed peripheral neuropathy. Subjects who received metronidazole were 4.3-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 17.1) more likely to develop peripheral neuropathies than subjects who received placebo. Metronidazole may have increased early sputum smear and culture conversion but was too neurotoxic to use over the longer term. Newer nitroimidazoles with both aerobic and anaerobic activity, now in clinical trials, may increase the sterilizing potency of future treatment regimens.",,,,2013-06-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23701742,The relevance of new drug combinations for modern tuberculosis treatment--a patent perspective.,,Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery,"Drug combinations (DCs) have been successfully used in different kinds of diseases such as cancer, AIDS, malaria, infectious diseases, asthma, diarrhea, hypertension, neurological disorders, among others. In this context, an important concept in drug discovery relates to the fixed-dose combinations (FDC), which can be defined as a formulation of two or more biologically active substances, combined in a single drug, and available at certain fixed doses. FDC presents several advantages, such as reduced risks of emergence of drug resistant strains, improvement of patient compliance, reduced costs of treatment and a simplified drug supply management, shipping and distribution. Due to the importance of DCs in drug discovery, the purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of this strategy for tuberculosis treatment and also for studies of new promising drug combinations to be used against this disease, specially focused on resistant bacterial strains.

23689722,Clinical validation of the analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin in oral fluid of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Linezolid plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, patients should be carefully monitored due to time- and dose-dependent toxicity. Clarithromycin plays a more modest role. Therapeutic drug monitoring may contribute to assessment of treatment regimens, helping to reduce toxicity while maintaining adequate drug exposure. Oral fluid sampling could provide a welcome alternative in cases where conventional plasma sampling is not possible or desirable. The aim of this study was to clinically validate the analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin and its metabolite hydroxyclarithromycin in oral fluid of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Serum and oral fluid samples were simultaneously obtained and analyzed by using validated methods, after extensive cross-validation between the two matrices. Passing-Bablok regressions and Bland-Altman analysis showed that oral fluid analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin appeared to be suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in MDR-TB patients. No correction factor is needed for the interpretation of linezolid oral fluid concentrations with a ratio of the linezolid concentration in serum to that in oral fluid of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.02). However, the clarithromycin concentration serum/clarithromycin concentration in oral fluid ratio is 3.07 (95% CI, 2.45 to 3.69). Analysis of hydroxyclarithromycin in oral fluid was not possible in this study due to a nonlinear relationship between the concentration in serum and that in oral fluid. In conclusion, the analysis of linezolid (no correction factor) and clarithromycin (correction factor of 3) in oral fluid is applicable for therapeutic drug monitoring in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as an alternative to conventional serum sampling. Easy sampling using a noninvasive technique may facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring for specific patient categories.",,,,2013-05-22,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Several clinical trials indicate that the biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) can guide antibiotic therapy. Some of these trials have shown a promising reduction in the number of antibiotic prescriptions, duration of antibiotic therapy and even length of stay in the ICU, although their size and selection criteria limit their external validity. The objectives of the Stop Antibiotics on guidance of Procalcitonin Study (SAPS) are to evaluate whether daily PCT can improve ""real-life"" antibiotic use in Dutch ICU's by reduction of the duration of antibiotic treatment without an increase of recurrent infections and mortality.
Multicenter randomised controlled intervention trial. Powered for superiority of the primary efficacy endpoint and non-inferiority on the primary safety endpoints (non-inferiority margin is set on 8%).
(1) ICU-patients aged ≥18 years and (2) receiving antibiotics for a presumed or proven infection and (3) signed informed consent.
(1) patients who require prolonged antibiotic therapy, (2) suffer from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (3) cystic fibrosis, (4) viral or parasitic infections and (5) those that are severely immunocompromised or (6) moribund.The intervention consists solely of an advice to discontinue antibiotic treatment in case PCT has decreased by more than 80% of its peak level (relative stopping threshold) or decrease below a value of 0.5 ng/ml (absolute stopping threshold).The study hypothesis is that PCT-guided therapy is non-inferior to standard care based on implemented guidelines and local expertise, whilst reducing antibiotic usage. Computerised 1:1 randomisation will allocate 908 patients per arm. Arm 1: standard of care. Arm 2: procalcitonin-guided therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is consumption of antibiotics expressed as the defined daily dosage and duration of antibiotic therapy expressed in days of therapy. This trial is designed to shorten antibiotics safely, therefore the primary safety endpoint is mortality measured at 28 day and 1 year.
This will be the largest procalcitonin-guided antibiotic intervention trial in ICU setting thus far. Currently 1600 of the planned 1816 patients are randomised (November 2012). The first interim analysis has passed without any safety or futility issues.

23547780,Key targets and relevant inhibitors for the drug discovery of tuberculosis.,,Current drug targets,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), killing about two million people worldwide each year. An increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis in the past decades has renewed focus on the development of new drugs that can treat both drug-sensitive and resistant TB infections. M. tuberculosis evades the host immune system and drug regimes by entering dormant phase within macrophage. As a consequence, there is a pressing need for new vaccines and antimicrobials to treat persistent infections. As clinically used antibiotics target very few essential functions of mycobacterium, it is rational that identification of new targets that are essential for bacterial growth and survival can serve as starting point for designing of novel drugs to cure both drug-sensitive and resistant TB infections. With the development of molecular biology and structural biology and the availability of the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis, some success has been achieved in the identification of new targets in M. tuberculosis and their relevant inhibitors. This review summarizes about ninety important targets that participate in a range of diverse physiological processes in M. tuberculosis and seven new drugs currently in clinical phase 2 or 3 trials.

Advances in particulate drug delivery have led to the formulation of capreomycin as the first antituberculosis drug available as a microparticle dry powder for inhalation and clinical study. Delivery by aerosol may result in successful treatment with lower doses. Here we report a phase I, single-dose, dose-escalating study aimed at demonstrating safety and tolerability in healthy subjects and measuring pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Twenty healthy adults (n = 5 per group) were recruited to self-administer a single dose of inhaled dry powder capreomycin (25-mg, 75-mg, 150-mg, or 300-mg nominal dose) using a simple, handheld delivery device. Inhalations were well tolerated by all subjects. The most common adverse event was mild to moderate transient cough, in five subjects. There were no changes in lung function, audiometry, or laboratory parameters. Capreomycin was rapidly absorbed after inhalation. Systemic concentrations were detected in each dose group within 20 min. Peak and mean plasma concentrations of capreomycin were dose proportional.

There has been a substantial increase in numbers of drugs in the development pipeline and two of the candidates are expected to receive widespread accelerated approval for the treatment of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). An important determining factor in the choice of regimens for phase III is the speed with which patients become culture negative during treatment, measured as either time to culture conversion or culture negativity at a given time point.

In this review, we describe the encouraging data on a number of drugs which are about to enter phase II or phase III trials, results from trials of standard regimens in close to programme conditions and a series of trials highlighting the importance of an early commencement of antiretroviral treatment.",,,,2013-03-27,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23520311,Clarithromycin increases linezolid exposure in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients.,,The European respiratory journal,"The use of linezolid for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is limited by dose- and time-dependent toxicity. Recently, we reported a case of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between linezolid and clarithromycin that resulted in increased linezolid exposure. The aim of this prospective pharmacokinetic study is to quantify the effect of clarithromycin on the exposure of linezolid. Subjects were included in an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, fixed-order pharmacokinetic interaction study. All subjects received 300 mg linezolid twice daily during the entire study, consecutively co-administered with 250 mg and 500 mg clarithromycin once daily. Steady-state serum curves of linezolid and clarithromycin were analysed using validated methods, and differences between pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Linezolid exposure increased by a median (interquartile range) of 44% (23-102%, p=0.043) after co-administration of 500 mg clarithromycin (n=5) compared to baseline, whereas 250 mg clarithromycin had no statistically significant effect. Co-administration was well tolerated by most patients; none experienced severe adverse effects. One patient reported common toxicity criteria grade 2 gastrointestinal adverse events. In this study, we showed that clarithromycin significantly increased linezolid serum exposure after combining clarithromycin with linezolid in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients. The drug-drug interaction is possibly P-glycoprotein-mediated. Due to large interpatient variability, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to determine individual effect size.",,,,2013-03-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23498589,What's in a name? The future of drug-resistant tuberculosis classification.,,The Lancet. Infectious diseases,"Due to a recent resurgence in tuberculosis research focused on drug development, several new antituberculosis drugs are in the pipeline, and the standard of care for tuberculosis might soon change. If new drugs replace the current first-line treatment, then existing classifications of resistance, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, might become less relevant. When much needed new drugs reach the market, a new classification system for resistance might need to be devised to describe resistance to these novel agents. Many options for such a system exist, each with its own inherent benefits and challenges. The adoption of new terminology for resistance should be guided by outcomes data from clinical trials in progress, and should be accompanied by increased support for drug susceptibility testing in developing countries to be clinically useful. Consideration of these issues now will hopefully help foster an informed approach to the classification of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the era of new drugs.",,,,2013-03-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23440842,Xpert® MTB/RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Accurate and rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and drug resistance are critical for improving patient care and decreasing the spread of TB. Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) is a rapid, automated test that can detect both TB and rifampicin resistance, within two hours after starting the test, with minimal hands-on technical time, but is more expensive than conventional sputum microscopy.
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert for pulmonary TB (TB detection), both where Xpert was used as an initial test replacing microscopy, and where Xpert was used as an add-on test following a negative smear microscopy result.To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert for rifampicin resistance detection where Xpert was used as the initial test, replacing conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing.The population of interest was adults suspected of having pulmonary TB or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), with or without HIV infection.
We performed a comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE; EMBASE; ISI Web of Knowledge; MEDION; LILACS; BIOSIS; and SCOPUS. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the search portal of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to identify ongoing trials. We performed searches on 25 September 2011 and we repeated them on 15 December 2011, without language restriction.
We included randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional, and cohort studies that used respiratory specimens to compare Xpert with culture for detecting TB and Xpert with conventional phenotypic drug susceptibility testing for detecting rifampicin resistance.
For each study, two review authors independently extracted a set of data using a standardized data extraction form. When possible, we extracted data for subgroups by smear and HIV status. We assessed the quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of Xpert separately for TB detection and rifampicin resistance detection using a bivariate random-effects model. We estimated the median pooled sensitivity and specificity and their 95% credible intervals (CrI).
We identified 18 unique studies as eligible for this review, including two multicentre international studies, one with five and the other with six distinct study centres. The majority of studies (55.6%) were performed in low-income and middle-income countries. In 17 of the 18 studies, Xpert was performed by trained technicians in reference laboratories.When used as an initial test replacing smear microscopy (15 studies, 7517 participants), Xpert achieved a pooled sensitivity of 88% (95% CrI 83% to 92%) and pooled specificity of 98% (95% CrI 97% to 99%). As an add-on test following a negative smear microscopy result (14 studies, 5719 participants), Xpert yielded a pooled sensitivity of 67% (95% CrI 58% to 74%) and pooled specificity of 98% (95% CrI 97% to 99%). In clinical subgroups, we found the following accuracy estimates: the pooled sensitivity was 98% (95% CrI 97% to 99%) for smear-positive, culture-positive TB and 68% (95% CrI 59% to 75%) for smear-negative, culture-positive TB (15 studies); the pooled sensitivity was 80% (95% CrI 67% to 88%) in people living with HIV and 89% (95% CrI 81% to 94%) in people without HIV infection (four studies). For rifampicin resistance detection (11 studies, 2340 participants), Xpert achieved a pooled sensitivity of 94% (95% CrI 87% to 97%) and pooled specificity of 98% (95% CrI 97% to 99%). In a separate analysis, Xpert could distinguish between TB and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in clinical samples with high accuracy: among 139 specimens with NTM, Xpert was positive in only one specimen that grew NTM.In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals suspected of having rifampicin resistance (a proxy for MDR-TB), where the prevalence of rifampicin resistance is 30%, we estimated that on average Xpert would wrongly identify 14 patients as being rifampicin resistant. In comparison, where the prevalence of rifampicin resistance is only 2%, we estimated that the number of individuals wrongly identified as rifampicin resistant would increase to 20, an increase of 43%.
This review shows that Xpert used as an initial diagnostic test for TB detection and rifampicin resistance detection in patients suspected of having TB, MDR-TB, or HIV-associated TB is sensitive and specific. Xpert may also be valuable as an add-on test following microscopy for patients who have previously been found to be smear-negative. An Xpert result that is positive for rifampicin resistance should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of MDR-TB in a given patient and the expected prevalence of MDR-TB in a given setting.Studies in this review mainly assessed sensitivity and specificity of the test when used in reference laboratories in research investigations. Most studies were performed in high TB burden countries. Ongoing use of Xpert in high TB burden countries will contribute to the evidence base on the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of Xpert in routine programmatic and peripheral health care settings, including settings where the test is performed at the point of care.",,,,2013-02-27,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The current study aimed at explaining the rapid expression of MDR in Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) compliant patients, represents the first study comparing global transcriptional profiles of 3 pairs of clinical Mtb isolates, collected longitudinally at initiation and completion of DOTS. While the isolates were drug susceptible (DS) at onset and MDR at completion of DOTS, they exhibited identical DNA fingerprints at both points of collection. The whole genome transcriptional analysis was performed using total RNA from H37Rv and 3 locally predominant spoligotypes viz. MANU1, CAS and Beijing, hybridized on MTBv3 (BuG@S) microarray, and yielded 36, 98 and 45 differentially expressed genes respectively. Genes encoding transcription factors (sig, rpoB), cell wall biosynthesis (emb genes), protein synthesis (rpl) and additional central metabolic pathways (ppdK, pknH, pfkB) were found to be down regulated in the MDR isolates as compared to the DS isolate of the same genotype. Up regulation of drug efflux pumps, ABC transporters, trans-membrane proteins and stress response transcriptional factors (whiB) in the MDR isolates was observed. The data indicated that Mtb, without specific mutations in drug target genes may persist in the host due to additional mechanisms like drug efflux pumps and lowered rate of metabolism. Furthermore this population of Mtb, which also showed reduced DNA repair activity, would result in selection and stabilization of spontaneous mutations in drug target genes, causing selection of a MDR strain in the presence of drug pressures. Efflux pump such as drrA may play a significant role in increasing fitness of low level drug resistant cells and assist in survival of Mtb till acquisition of drug resistant mutations with least fitness cost.",,,,2013-01-29,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

An open-label randomized clinical trial was performed and analyzed for equivalence. Seven hundred and twelve HIV-infected, ART-naïve patients without active TB were randomized to receive either ethambutol 800 mg and isoniazid 300 mg daily for six-months (6EH) or isoniazid 300 mg daily for 36-months (36H). Drugs were dispensed fortnightly and adherence checked by home visits. Patients had chest radiograph, sputum smear and culture performed every six months, in addition to investigations if they developed symptoms. The primary endpoint was incident TB while secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and adverse events. Survival analysis was performed on the modified intent to treat population (m-ITT) and rates compared.
Tuberculosis developed in 22 (6.4%) of 344 subjects in the 6EH arm and 13 (3.8%) of 339 subjects in the 36H arm with incidence rates of 2.4/100 py (95%CI- 1.4-3.5) and 1.6/100 py (95% CI-0.8-3.0) with an adjusted rate ratio (aIRR) of 1.6 (0.8-3.2). Among TST-positive subjects, the aIRR of 6EH was 1.7 (0.6-4.3) compared to 36H, p = 0.8. All-cause mortality and toxicity were similar in the two arms. Among 15 patients with confirmed TB, 4 isolates were resistant to isoniazid and 2 were multidrug-resistant.
Both regimens were similarly effective in preventing TB, when compared to historical incidence rates. However, there was a trend to lower TB incidence with 36H.

One of the main difficulties is obtaining adequate specimens for bacteriological confirmation of the disease in children.The aim of this study is to evaluate the adequacy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for the diagnosis of TB.
In a prospective study conducted at the paediatric hospital in Bangui in 2007-2009, we used fine-needle aspiration to obtain samples for diagnosis of TB from 131 children aged 0-17 years with persistent lymphadenitis.
Fine-needle aspiration provided samples that could be used for bacteriological confirmation of TB. Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was positive in 42.7% of samples, and culture identified TB in 67.2% of cases. Of 75 samples that were stain-negative, 49 (65.3%) were culture-positive, while 12 stain-positive samples remained culture-negative. Ten of the 12 stain-positive, culture-negative samples were from patients who had received previous antimicrobial therapy.

While new candidate drugs are being developed, reinvestigation of already approved drugs available for other indications could be of value. The objective of this study is to determine tentative drug susceptibility testing strategies and breakpoints for thioridazine, a well-known and well-tolerated neuroleptic drug, which has been shown to be effective against drug resistant tuberculosis both in vitro and in vivo.
By testing the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on Middlebrook 7H10 media, the wild-type distribution of thioridazine was established for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=51) and this distribution was compared to the MICs of M/XDR strains (n=67).
A tentative epidemiological cut off (ECOFF) of thioridazine at 16mg/L was suggested. Even though such concentrations are not clinically achievable in serum, thioridazine is concentrated intracellularly and concentrations of only 0.1mg/L has been shown to kill M. tuberculosis residing inside cells. MICs above the wild-type (MIC>16mg/L) were found in 4/67 (6%) of the M/XDR strains suggesting that resistance mechanisms against thioridazine may already be present in resistant clinical strains.
In view of the difficulties obtaining clinical outcome data for single drugs in the case of tuberculosis since combination therapy is mandatory, the tentative ECOFF may be considered a tentative clinical breakpoint, but the findings should be validated by others. The data from this study strengthens the use of thioridazine as a treatment option for M/XDR tuberculosis, although its proper place in the therapeutic arsenal should ideally be confirmed in clinical trials.",,"A tentative epidemiological cut off (ECOFF) of thioridazine at 16mg/L was suggested.

23188213,When to start antiretroviral therapy during tuberculosis treatment?,,Current opinion in infectious diseases,"Effective treatment exists for tuberculosis (TB) and for HIV, but treating both diseases simultaneously presents several challenges. This review assesses the evidence for the timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in patients coinfected with TB.
Published evidence clearly demonstrates that TB-HIV integration is essential for improved survival, but the question of when to start ART during TB treatment is more complex. Five randomized controlled trials assessed this question: four trials showed no difference in the incidence rates of AIDS or death between TB patients initiating ART within 2 months compared to later during TB therapy, while one trial showed a significant survival gain with ART initiation within 2 weeks of TB therapy start. All five studies found improved AIDS-free survival with earlier ART initiation in TB patients with low CD4 T-cell counts, except among patients with TB meningitis. The survival benefit was, however, accompanied by increased immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome events.
The trial data support the World Health Organization recommendations on when to start ART in TB-HIV coinfected patients including earlier ART initiation in severely immune-compromised patients. However, several challenges remain in integrating TB and HIV treatment in public healthcare services. Additional research on timing of ART is needed for patients with drug-resistant and extrapulmonary TB, notably TB meningitis.",,,,2012-11-29,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23134697,Assessment of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis with gastric lavage aspirates in children in sub-Saharan Africa: a prospective descriptive study.,,The Lancet. Infectious diseases,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children remains challenging because of difficulties in obtaining sputum samples and the paucibacillary nature of the disease. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is useful for rapid diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis with sputum and nasopharyngeal samples. We assessed this assay for the detection of tuberculosis and multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis with gastric lavage aspirate (GLA) samples in children admitted to hospital.
We did a prospective study to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay with GLA samples for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis and MDR tuberculosis in new paediatric inpatient admissions at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia. Children aged 15 years or younger were recruited between June, 2011, and May, 2012. GLA and sputum were analysed by standard smear-microscopy, mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) culture, MGIT drug-susceptibility testing, and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was assessed with the Pearson χ(2) or Fishers exact test.
Of 930 children, 142 produced sputum and GLA was obtained from 788 non-sputum producers. Culture-positive tuberculosis was identified in 58 (6·2%) of 930 children: ten from sputum producers and 48 from GLA of non-sputum producers. The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were similar: sensitivity was 68·8% (95% CI 53·6-80·9) for GLA versus 90·0% (54·1-99·5; p=0·1649) for sputum samples; specificity was 99·3% (98·3-99·8) for GLA and 98·5% (94·1-99·7; p=0·2871) for sputum samples. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected an extra 28 tuberculosis cases compared with smear microscopy and was significantly more sensitive than smear microscopy for both sputum (90·0% [54·1-99·5] vs 30·0% [8·1-64·6], p=0·01) and GLA (68·8% [53·6-80·9] vs 25·0% [14·1-40·0], p<0·0001). The assay load did not differ significantly by sample type (p=0·791). 22 children were infected with HIV and tuberculosis and significant differences in assay performance could not be detected when stratifying by HIV status for either sample type. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected rifampicin resistance in three GLA samples: two confirmed as MDR tuberculosis and one false positive.
Analyses of GLA samples with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a sensitive and specific method for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children who cannot produce sputum. The single site nature of our study invites caution.

Although these show substantial promise for drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis, the presently planned studies of these compounds will not inform their optimal use, as each will be tested singly vs placebo with existing drugs, rather than in new regimens. Each successive regulatory approval will increase the size, cost, and complexity of trials for those that follow, causing delays during which suboptimal use will occur and resistance will emerge. This paper proposes the development of a novel regimen with the potential for use in both drug-sensitive (DS) and DR tuberculosis. Adaptive licensing for DR tuberculosis based on 2-month sputum culture would shorten time to initial approval by several years.

26591721,"Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance pattern among pulmonary tuberculosis patients with or without HIV infection in Mwanza, Tanzania.",,Tanzania journal of health research,"Anti-tuberculosis drug resistance is a major problem in tuberculosis (TB) control, particularly multi-drug resistance TB (MDR-TB). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of primary and acquired anti-TB drug resistance among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (PTB) and relapse cases. Sputa were collected from newly diagnosed and relapse PTB patients. Drug susceptibility tests (DST) were performed on sputum culture positive isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using resistance ratio method on four first-line anti-TB drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin. Demographic and anthropometric information was collected and HIV status was determined. Of the 523 culture positive isolates, DST results were available for 503 (96%), 455 were new and 48 were relapse cases. Resistance to at least one of the four drugs was observed in 7.8% (39/503) of the isolates, 7.3% (33/455) were new and 12.5% (6/48) were from relapse cases. Mono resistance to isoniazid was higher in both among new 45.5% (15/33) and relapse 50.0% (3/6) cases. Resistance to rifampicin and streptomycin alone was equal 4/33 (12.1%) and only among new cases. Resistance to ethambutol alone was only one among new cases. Overall MDR-TB prevalence was 2.4% (12/503), nine were new and three were relapse cases. MDR-TB was 17.9% (7/39) for rifampicin and isoniazid. Prevalence of HIV was 43.3% and was similar among new and relapse cases and not risk factor for drug resistance. Majority of PTB patients (52%) had BMI below 18 kg/m2. Those with BMI greater than 18 kg/m2 were more likely to develop drug resistance than those with BMI below 18 kg/m2 (P=0.004). With the resurgence of TB and the high prevalence of HIV among TB patients, prevalence of drug resistance is still low both among new and relapses cases. Despite the current low drug resistance, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the resistance.",,,,2012-10-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Delamanid (OPC-67683) is a novel anti-TB medication with demonstrated activity against multidrug-resistant disease. Patients who participated in the previously reported randomised, placebo-controlled trial of delamanid and the subsequent open-label extension trial were eligible to participate in a 24-month observational study designed to capture treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by clinicians and defined by the World Health Organization, were categorised as favourable and unfavourable. Delamanid treatment groups were combined for analysis, based on their duration of treatment. In total, for 421 (87.5%) out of 481 patients from the original randomised controlled trial, consent was granted for follow-up assessments. Favourable outcomes were observed in 143 (74.5%) out of 192 patients who received delamanid for ≥6 months, compared to 126 (55%) out of 229 patients who received delamanid for ≤2 months. Mortality was reduced to 1.0% among those receiving long-term delamanid versus short-term/no delamanid (8.3%; p<0.001). Treatment benefit was also seen among patients with extensively drug-resistant TB. This analysis suggests that treatment with delamanid for 6 months in combination with an optimised background regimen can improve outcomes and reduce mortality among patients with both multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB.",,,,2012-09-29,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
23006760,Importance of the genetic diversity within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex for the development of novel antibiotics and diagnostic tests of drug resistance.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Despite being genetically monomorphic, the limited genetic diversity within the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) has practical consequences for molecular methods for drug susceptibility testing and for the use of current antibiotics and those in clinical trials. It renders some representatives of MTBC intrinsically resistant against one or multiple antibiotics and affects the spectrum and consequences of resistance mutations selected for during treatment. Moreover, neutral or silent changes within genes responsible for drug resistance can cause false-positive results with hybridization-based assays, which have been recently introduced to replace slower phenotypic methods. We discuss the consequences of these findings and propose concrete steps to rigorously assess the genetic diversity of MTBC to support ongoing clinical trials.",,,,2012-09-26,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Although numbers are in decrease since 2006, tuberculosis still represents a global issue and a major public health threat, due to appearance of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. Although anti-tuberculosis drugs currently used are effective against tuberculosis, they present however more and more limits, especially in treating complex cases of tuberculosis, increasing therefore the need to develop new tools and approaches to treat tuberculosis today.
In this review, we describe anti-tuberculosis drugs in Phase II clinical trials and in preclinical phase that are likely to play a crucial role in the management of tuberculosis cases in a near future. SQ109, TMC207, nitroimidazoles, and oxazolidinones are currently in Phase II clinical trials while BDM31343, SQ641, CPZEN-45, RBx 8700, DC-159a, and BTZ043 are in preclinical phase.

CFZ has several side effects which can be attributed to its extremely high lipophilicity. A series of novel riminophenazine analogues bearing a C-2 pyridyl substituent was designed and synthesized with the goal of maintaining potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) while improving upon its safety profile by lowering the lipophilicity. All compounds were evaluated for their in vitro activity and cytotoxicity. The results demonstrated that many new compounds had potent activity against M. tuberculosis with MICs of less than 0.03 μg/mL and low cytotoxicity with IC(50) values greater than 64 μg/mL. Some compounds were tested for in vivo efficacy against MDR-TB in an experimental mouse infection model.

22915310,From magic mountain to table mountain.,,Swiss medical weekly,"Prior to the introduction of chemotherapy, tuberculosis management relied upon aerotherapy, heliotherapy and good nutrition. This ""treatment"", exemplified by the regimen applied in Swiss and other European mountain resorts, is described by Thomas Mann in the book ""The Magic Mountain"". Tuberculosis chemotherapy began in 1944 with the introduction of streptomycin and para-amino-salicylic acid, later augmented by isoniazid. Early experience taught physicians that treatment must be given with multiple drugs to prevent emergence of resistance and that prolonged treatment adherence for 18-24 months was needed for a permanent cure of tuberculosis. Between 1970 and 1980 rifampicin was introduced and with pyrazinamide it made ""short-course"" treatment possible. For 30 years, a 6-month directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) based on the three compounds isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was the foundation of tuberculosis control strategies world-wide, and in recent years this was supplemented with ethambutol in view of increasing rates of isoniazid resistance. However, even 6 months of treatment is too long to easily ensure the compliance necessary to permanently cure tuberculosis. The recent spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has placed tuberculosis programmes under severe pressure and is accompanied by an increase in drug-resistance making tuberculosis virtually untreatable in some instances. In 2004 the first of a new generation of anti-tuberculosis drugs entered clinical evaluation. A series of clinical trials, often conducted at sites in Cape Town, South Africa, has shown them to be efficacious and hold promise of being able to shorten tuberculosis treatment and treat drug-resistant tuberculosis. Development and assessment of these drugs is ongoing but there is renewed hope that these new drugs and regimens will assist in finally conquering tuberculosis, preventing a return to Magic Mountain where sunshine and fresh air was all that could be offered to patients.",,,,2012-08-24,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Patients were randomly allocated into two arms: one (n = 62) received a once-daily pill of V-5 Immunitor™ (V5) and the other (control; n= 61) received placebo for 30 days in addition to first- or second-line TB drugs administered under directly observed therapy. The subjects in V5 and placebo arms had first-diagnosed, relapsed, treatment-failed and multidrug-resistant TB at ratios of 17:21:11:13 and 20:19:14:8, respectively; among them, ten and seven had HIV coinfection, respectively.

Tertiary care hospitals provide an opportunity to study TB co-morbidity with non-communicable and other communicable diseases (NCDs/CDs). We evaluated the burden of undiagnosed pulmonary TB and multi-drug resistant TB in adult inpatients, regardless of their primary admission diagnosis, in a tertiary referral centre.
In this prospective study, newly admitted adult inpatients able to produce sputum at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, were screened for pulmonary TB using fluorescent smear microscopy and automated liquid culture. The burden of pulmonary TB, unsuspected TB, TB co-morbidity with NCDs and CDs was determined. Sputum was analysed from 900 inpatients (70.6% HIV infected) 277 (30.8%) non-TB suspects, 286 (31.8%) TB suspects and 337 (37.4%) were already receiving TB treatment. 202/900 (22.4%) of patients had culture confirmed TB.

There were 18 confirmed cases of MDR-TB, 5 of which were unsuspected.
A large burden of unsuspected pulmonary TB co-morbidity exists in inpatients with NCDs and other CDs.

We investigated new multiple-agent combinations over the first 14 days of treatment to assess their suitability for future development.
In this prospective, randomised, early bactericidal activity (EBA) study, treatment-naive, drug-susceptible patients with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis were admitted to hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa, between Oct 7, 2010, and Aug 19, 2011. Patients were randomised centrally by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive bedaquiline, bedaquiline-pyrazinamide, PA-824-pyrazinamide, bedaquiline-PA-824, PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide, or unmasked standard antituberculosis treatment as positive control. The primary outcome was the 14-day EBA assessed in a central laboratory from the daily fall in colony forming units (CFU) of M tuberculosis per mL of sputum in daily overnight sputum collections. Bilinear regression curves were fitted for each group separately and groups compared with ANOVA for ranks, followed by pair-wise comparisons adjusted for multiplicity. Clinical staff were partially masked but laboratory personnel were fully masked. This study is registered, NCT01215851.
The mean 14-day EBA of PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide (n=13; 0·233 [SD 0·128]) was significantly higher than that of bedaquiline (14; 0·061 [0·068]), bedaquiline-pyrazinamide (15; 0·131 [0·102]), bedaquiline-PA-824 (14; 0·114 [0·050]), but not PA-824-pyrazinamide (14; 0·154 [0·040]), and comparable with that of standard treatment (ten; 0·140 [0·094]). Treatments were well tolerated and appeared safe. One patient on PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide was withdrawn because of corrected QT interval changes exceeding criteria prespecified in the protocol.
PA-824-moxifloxacin-pyrazinamide is potentially suitable for treating drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Multiagent EBA studies can contribute to reducing the time needed to develop new antituberculosis regimens.

The long treatment duration has led to increased patient noncompliance with therapy. This, in turn, drives the development of additional drug resistance in a spiral that has resulted in some forms of TB being currently untreatable by existing drugs. New antitubercular drugs in development, particularly those with mechanisms of action that are different from existing first- and second-line TB drugs, are anticipated to be effective against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB.

To overcome these issues, we reexamined two FDA-approved antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP), for use in TB treatment. SMX and TMP inhibit folic acid biosynthesis and are used in combination to treat infections of the respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts. The MICs of SMX and TMP, alone and in combination, were determined for drug-susceptible, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. While TMP alone was not effective against M. tuberculosis, the combination of TMP and SMX was bacteriostatic against M. tuberculosis. Surprisingly, the combination of SMX and TMP was also active against a subset of MDR M. tuberculosis strains. Treatment of M. tuberculosis with TMP-SMX and a first-line anti-TB drug, either isoniazid or rifampin, was bactericidal, demonstrating that the combination of TMP and SMX with isoniazid or rifampin was not antagonistic. Moreover, the addition of SMX-TMP in combination with either isoniazid or rifampin also prevented the emergence of drug resistance in vitro. In conclusion, this study further illustrates the opportunity to reevaluate the activity of TMP-SMX in vivo to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis.",,,,2012-07-25,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

To explain why the efficacies of isoniazid (INH) and rifamycins during the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are related not to the area under the curve (AUC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but to peak drug concentrations.
We examined the response in clinical trials with patients treated with INH alone and divided into slow and rapid acetylators of INH.
The efficacy of INH is best related to peak concentrations, as repeated peaks can kill low-degree resistant mutants. A similar process might result in repeated peak concentrations of rifamycins killing low-tolerance persisters.
If the efficacy of rifamycins is best related to peak concentrations, we can explain the discrepancy between mouse studies on daily rifapentine (RPT) and the failure to accelerate elimination of TB from sputum in the TBTC Study 29A, as daily RPT greatly increases the AUC but not the peak concentrations.

Some compounds are presently in clinical trials, while others are being investigated in an attempt to explore new compounds for the target based treatment. The present review provides an overview of the new anti-TB agents with different molecular structures that are being clinically used and advanced stages of preclinical as well as clinical stages and also attempted to highlight the efforts that are being made in the development of new drug molecules as lead anti-TB agents.",,,,2012-05-26,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

New compounds must be used together with existing drugs, yet clinical trials to optimize combinations of drugs for drug-resistant tuberculosis are lacking. We conducted an extensive review of existing in vitro, animal, and clinical studies involving World Health Organization-defined group 1, 2, and 4 drugs used in drug-resistant tuberculosis regimens to inform clinical trials and identify critical research questions. Results suggest that optimizing the dosing of pyrazinamide, the injectables, and isoniazid for drug-resistant tuberculosis is a high priority. Additional pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicodynamic studies are needed for pyrazinamide and ethionamide. Clinical trials of the comparative efficacy and appropriate treatment duration of injectables are recommended. For isoniazid, rapid genotypic tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutations should be nested in clinical trials. Further research focusing on optimization of dose and duration of drugs with activity against drug-resistant tuberculosis is paramount.",,,,2012-05-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Increasingly, IVIg is being used (in doses higher than for replacement therapy) in certain bacterial or viral infectious diseases. A variety of modes of action have been attributed to the beneficial effects of IVIg, including its interaction with T-cell function, antigen-presenting cell maturation/presentation, combined with a general ""tune down"" effect on inflammatory reactions. More often, IVIg is being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of refractory and difficult-to-treat chronic infections.

22607233,"A pivotal registration phase III, multicenter, randomized tuberculosis controlled trial: design issues and lessons learnt from the Gatifloxacin for TB (OFLOTUB) project.",,Trials,"There have been no major advances in tuberculosis (TB) drug development since the first East African/British Medical Research Council short course chemotherapy trial 35 years ago. Since then, the landscape for conducting TB clinical trials has profoundly changed with the emergence of HIV infection, the spread of resistant TB bacilli strains, recent advances in mycobacteriological capacity, and drug discovery. As a consequence questions have arisen on the most appropriate approach to design and conduct current TB trials. To highlight key issues discussed: Is a superiority, equivalence, or non-inferiority design most appropriate? What should be the primary efficacy outcome? How to consider re-infections in the definition of the outcome? What is the optimal length of patient follow-up? Is blinding appropriate when treatment duration in test arm is shorter? What are the appropriate assumptions for sample size calculation?
Various drugs are currently in the development pipeline. We are presenting in this paper the design of the most recently completed phase III TB trial, the OFLOTUB project, which is the pivotal trial of a registration portfolio for a gatifloxacin-containing TB regimen. It is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a gatifloxacin-containing 4-month regimen (trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov database: NCT00216385).
In the light of the recent scientific and regulatory discussions, we discuss some of the design issues in TB clinical trials and more specifically the reasons that guided our choices, in order to best answer the trial objectives, while at the same time satisfying regulatory authority requirements.
When shortening TB treatment, we are advocating for a non-inferiority, non-blinded design, with a composite unfavorable endpoint assessed 12 months post treatment completion, and added trial procedures specifically aiming to: (1) minimize endpoint unavailability; and (2) distinguish between relapse and re-infection.",,"In the light of the recent scientific and regulatory discussions, we discuss some of the design issues in TB clinical trials and more specifically the reasons that guided our choices, in order to best answer the trial objectives, while at the same time satisfying regulatory authority requirements.","When shortening TB treatment, we are advocating for a non-inferiority, non-blinded design, with a composite unfavorable endpoint assessed 12 months post treatment completion, and added trial procedures specifically aiming to: (1) minimize endpoint unavailability; and (2) distinguish between relapse and re-infection.",2012-05-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
22564839,Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin in South African patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Despite the important role of fluoroquinolones and the predominant use of ofloxacin for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa, there are limited data on ofloxacin pharmacokinetics in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, no ofloxacin pharmacokinetic data from South African patients, and no direct assessment of the relationship between ofloxacin pharmacokinetics and the MIC of ofloxacin of patient isolates. Our objectives are to describe ofloxacin pharmacokinetics in South African patients being treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and assess the adequacy of ofloxacin drug exposure with respect to the probability of pharmacodynamic target attainment (area under the time curve/MIC ratio of at least 100). Sixty-five patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were recruited from 2 hospitals in South Africa. We determined the ofloxacin MICs for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from baseline sputum specimens. Patients received daily doses of 800 mg ofloxacin, in addition to other antitubercular drugs. Patients underwent pharmacokinetic sampling at steady state. NONMEM was used for data analysis. The population pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin in this study has been adequately described. The probability of target attainment expectation in the study population was 0.45. Doubling the dose to 1,600 mg could increase this to only 0.77. The currently recommended ofloxacin dose appeared inadequate for the majority of this study population. Studies to assess the tolerability of higher doses are warranted. Alternatively, ofloxacin should be replaced with more potent fluoroquinolones.",,,,2012-05-09,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In order to fight this pathogen, two routes are practicable: vaccination or drug treatment. Vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with the current vaccine Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is partially successful, being its efficacy variable. A few new tuberculosis vaccines are now in various phases of clinical trials. The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis gave the impulse to discover new effective antitubercular drugs, a few of which are in clinical development. Here we focus on three different classes of very promising antitubercular drugs recently discovered (benzothiazinones, dinitrobenzamides, and benzoquinoxalines) that share the same cellular target: a subunit of the heteromeric decaprenylphosphoryl-β-D: -ribose 2'-epimerase, encoded by the dprE1 (or Rv3790) gene.

This agent is currently being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to address the urgent need for new drugs that can overcome existing and emerging drug resistance. However, the use of clofazimine in tuberculosis treatment is hampered by its high lipophilicity and skin pigmentation side effects. To identify a new generation of riminophenazines that is less lipophilic and skin staining, while maintaining efficacy, we have performed a systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation by synthesizing a variety of analogs of clofazimine and evaluating their anti-tuberculosis activity. The study reveals that the central tricyclic phenazine system and the pendant aromatic rings are important for anti-tuberculosis activity. However, the phenyl groups attached to the C2 and N5 position of clofazimine can be replaced by a pyridyl group to provide analogs with improved physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Replacement of the phenyl group attached to the C2 position by a pyridyl group has led to a promising new series of compounds with improved physicochemical properties, improved anti-tuberculosis potency, and reduced pigmentation potential.",,,,2012-04-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
22470117,Influence of antituberculosis drug resistance and Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage on outcome in HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis (TBM) has high mortality. Aside from the devastating impact of multidrug resistance (MDR) on survival, little is understood about the influence of other bacterial factors on outcome. This study examined the influence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance, bacterial lineage, and host vaccination status on outcome in patients with HIV-associated TBM. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from the cerebrospinal fluid of 186 patients enrolled in two studies of HIV-associated TBM in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, were tested for resistance to first-line antituberculosis drugs. Lineage genotyping was available for 122 patients. The influence of antituberculosis drug resistance and M. tuberculosis lineage on 9-month mortality was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox multiple regression models. Isoniazid (INH) resistance without rifampin resistance was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 2.66; P = 0.005), and multidrug resistance was uniformly fatal (n = 8/8; adjusted HR, 5.21, 95% CI, 2.38 to 11.42; P < 0.0001). The hazard ratio for INH-resistant cases was greatest during the continuation phase of treatment (after 3 months; HR, 5.05 [95% CI, 2.23 to 11.44]; P = 0.0001). Among drug-susceptible cases, patients infected with the ""modern"" Beijing lineage strains had lower mortality than patients infected with the ""ancient"" Indo-Oceanic lineage (HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.61]; P = 0.001). Isoniazid resistance, multidrug resistance, and M. tuberculosis lineage are important determinants of mortality in patients with HIV-associated TBM.

22467670,Meta-analysis of clinical studies supports the pharmacokinetic variability hypothesis for acquired drug resistance and failure of antituberculosis therapy.,,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"Using hollow-fiber tuberculosis studies, we recently demonstrated that nonadherence is not a significant factor for ADR and that therapy failure only occurs after a large proportion of doses are missed. Computer-aided clinical trial simulations have suggested that isoniazid and rifampin pharmacokinetic variability best explained poor outcomes. We were interested in determining whether isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability was associated with either microbiological failure or ADR in the clinic.
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that reported isoniazid acetylation status and microbiological outcomes were selected. The main effects examined were microbiological sputum conversion, ADR, and relapse. Effect size was expressed as pooled risk ratios (RRs) comparing rapid with slow acetylators.
Thirteen randomized studies with 1631 rapid acetylators and 1751 slow acetylators met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Rapid acetylators were more likely than slow acetylators to have microbiological failure (RR, 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.7), ADR (RR, 2.0; CI, 1.1-3.4), and relapse (RR, 1.3; CI, .9-2.0). Higher failure rates were encountered even in drug regimens comprising >3 antibiotics. No publication bias or small-study effects were observed for the outcomes evaluated.

22448017,Rational development of adjunct immune-based therapies for drug-resistant tuberculosis: hypotheses and experimental designs.,,The Journal of infectious diseases,"The poor treatment outcomes for extensively drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and the slow progress in development and evaluation of new tuberculosis drugs gave rise to development of several potential immune-based therapies for adjunct use with drug treatment. However, none of these therapies have been shown to be of benefit in controlled clinical trials in humans. There is an urgent need to rethink the immunology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and to ascertain protective immune mechanisms that could be exploited to develop more effective adjunct immune therapies. T cells obtained from the peripheral blood circulation may not reflect the biologically relevant recognition of anti-M. tuberculosis T-cell responses in situ. Thus, T cells that mediate protective anti-M. tuberculosis immune responses recognize an as-yet undiscovered set of M. tuberculosis antigens that require definition. The biologically and clinically relevant M. tuberculosis targets that elicit protective immune responses may have yet to be discovered. The entire M. tuberculosis proteome is now accessible for screening by antibody recognition and can therefore be used to identify specific T-cell M. tuberculosis target antigens. Inhibitory cytokines and lymphocytosis present in chronic tuberculosis inflammation may be deleterious in mounting an effective M. tuberculosis T-cell response. Consequently, aberrant and noneffective immune responses could be refocused with anticytokine or cellular therapy. Epigenetic changes due to chronic inflammation may be responsible, in part, for impaired immune responses in tuberculosis and these changes could be reversed. We present feasible experimental designs to test these hypotheses; the results of which may guide and refocus development of novel immune-based therapies for adjunct treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

Most drug discovery projects under way exploit enzyme systems deemed essential in a specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis biosynthetic pathway or develop chemical scaffolds identified by phenotypic screening of compound libraries, specific pharmacophores or chemical clusters, and natural products.

22430968,Phase II dose-ranging trial of the early bactericidal activity of PA-824.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"PA-824 is a novel nitroimidazo-oxazine under evaluation as an antituberculosis agent. A dose-ranging randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and early bactericidal activity of PA-824 in drug-sensitive, sputum smear-positive adult pulmonary-tuberculosis patients to find the lowest dose giving optimal bactericidal activity (EBA). Fifteen patients per cohort received oral PA-824 in doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg per kg body weight per day for 14 days. Eight subjects received once-daily standard antituberculosis treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) as a positive control. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean rate of decline in log CFU of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum incubated on agar plates from serial overnight sputum collections, expressed as log(10) CFU/day/ml sputum (± standard deviation). The mean 14-day EBA of HRZE was consistent with previous studies (0.177 ± 0.042), and that of PA-824 at 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg was 0.063 ± 0.058, 0.091 ± 0.073, 0.078 ± 0.074, and 0.112 ± 0.070, respectively. Although the study was not powered for testing the difference between arms, there was a trend toward significance, indicating a lower EBA at the 50-mg dose. Serum PA-824 levels were approximately dose proportional with respect to the area under the time-concentration curve. All doses were safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting adverse events or clinically significant QTc changes. A dose of 100 mg to 200 mg PA-824 daily appears to be safe and efficacious and will be further evaluated as a component of novel antituberculosis regimens for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis.",,,,2012-03-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Introduction in the 60's of first-line drug regimen resulted in the control of the disease and TB was perceived as defeating. However, since the progression of HIV leading to co-infection with AIDS and the emergence of drug resistant strains, the need of new anti-tuberculosis drugs was not overstated. However in the past 40 years any new molecule did succeed in reaching the market. Today, the pipeline of potential new treatments has been fulfilled with several compounds in clinical trials or preclinical development with promising activities against sensitive and resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Compounds as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, metronidazole or linezolid already used against other bacterial infections are currently evaluated in clinical phases 2 or 3 for treating tuberculosis.

Four types of solid sublingual formulations of Immunoxel were made: sugar dragées, sugar-coated pills, gelatin pastilles and dried-honey lozenges. They were administered once-daily along with TB drugs. After 1 month, 84.1% of TB patients became sputum-negative with rates in individual groups of 89.5, 70, 76.9 and 100%, respectively. The conversion rate was independent of bodyweight, age, gender, differences in chemotherapy regimens or whether subjects had newly diagnosed TB, re-treated TB, multidrug-resistant TB or TB with HIV coinfection. Patients experienced earlier clinical improvement, faster defervescence, weight gain, a higher hemoglobin content and reduced inflammation as evidenced by lower leukocyte counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Despite the devastating impact on society, the tools to fight tuberculosis are very limited. Current standard therapy has been used for over 40 years and threats, such as the HIV epidemic and drug-resistant strains, undermine efforts to control the disease. New drugs are needed to address the challenges faced globally.
Current therapy is briefly reviewed in this paper and then new doses and combinations of existing drugs are presented. New candidate drugs are also discussed, along with the potential benefits and pitfalls of each of the compounds and approaches to therapy.
Despite the need to develop new drugs, the ability of programs to deliver existing therapies must not be neglected. Directly observed therapy and a standard basic level of care for all patients with tuberculosis, regardless of where they reside, is imperative, and will ensure that new drugs and regimens will have the greatest possible impact. New combination regimens, including PA 824 and TMC207, in combination with existing drugs, are very exciting - not only because of their ability to shorten treatment regimens in pan-susceptible cases, but also because they can be used among drug-resistant strains.

Surgical face masks used by patients with tuberculosis (TB) are believed to reduce transmission but have not been rigorously tested.
We sought to quantify the efficacy of surgical face masks when worn by patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).
Over 3 months, 17 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB occupied an MDR-TB ward in South Africa and wore face masks on alternate days. Ward air was exhausted to two identical chambers, each housing 90 pathogen-free guinea pigs that breathed ward air either when patients wore surgical face masks (intervention group) or when patients did not wear masks (control group). Efficacy was based on differences in guinea pig infections in each chamber.
Sixty-nine of 90 control guinea pigs (76.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68-85%) became infected, compared with 36 of 90 intervention guinea pigs (40%; 95% CI, 31-51%), representing a 56% (95% CI, 33-70.5%) decreased risk of TB transmission when patients used masks.

Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB patients were randomized into either Model 1 or 2. Treatment outcomes were given as cure rates, completion rates, failure rates or success rates at 18 months in the MDR-TB group and 6 months in the non-MDR-TB group. The sputum conversion rate at 1 month were evaluated for both groups. In the MDR-TB group, the sputum conversion rate was 20% (95% CI 8-45) in Model 1 and 90% (95% CI 73-98) in Model 2 (p < 0.001).

Failure of current therapy is attributed to a long duration of treatment leading to nonadherence and irregular therapy, lack of patient education about the disease, poverty, irregular supply by care providers, drug-drug interactions in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), inadequate regulations causing market overlap and irresponsible drug usage in the private sector, and lack of research, with no addition of new drugs in the last four decades. Present standards of care for the treatment of drugsusceptible tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, tuberculosis-HIV coinfection, and latent tuberculosis infection are all unsatisfactory. Since 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) has focused on drug development for tuberculosis, as well as research in all relevant aspects to discover new regimens by 2015 and to eliminate tuberculosis as a public health concern by 2050. As a result, some 20 promising compounds from 14 groups of drugs have been discovered. Twelve candidates from eight classes are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Ongoing research should prioritize identification of novel targets and newer application of existing drugs, discovery of multitargeted drugs from natural compounds, strengthening host factors by immunopotentiation with herbal immunomodulators, as well as protective vaccines before and after exposure, consideration of surgical measures when indicated, development of tools for rapid diagnosis, early identification of resistant strains, and markers for adequacy of treatment and an integrative approach to fulfill WHO goals.

22252828,"SQ109 targets MmpL3, a membrane transporter of trehalose monomycolate involved in mycolic acid donation to the cell wall core of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"SQ109, a 1,2-diamine related to ethambutol, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of tuberculosis, but its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SQ109 disrupts cell wall assembly, as evidenced by macromolecular incorporation assays and ultrastructural analyses. SQ109 interferes with the assembly of mycolic acids into the cell wall core of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as bacilli exposed to SQ109 show immediate inhibition of trehalose dimycolate (TDM) production and fail to attach mycolates to the cell wall arabinogalactan. These effects were not due to inhibition of mycolate synthesis, since total mycolate levels were unaffected, but instead resulted in the accumulation of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), the precursor of TDM and cell wall mycolates. In vitro assays using purified enzymes showed that this was not due to inhibition of the secreted Ag85 mycolyltransferases. We were unable to achieve spontaneous generation of SQ109-resistant mutants; however, analogs of this compound that resulted in similar shutdown of TDM synthesis with concomitant TMM accumulation were used to spontaneously generate resistant mutants that were also cross-resistant to SQ109. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants showed that these all had mutations in the essential mmpL3 gene, which encodes a transmembrane transporter. Our results suggest that MmpL3 is the target of SQ109 and that MmpL3 is a transporter of mycobacterial TMM.",,,,2012-01-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In concentration of 60 or 80 mcg/ml the drug showed significant antituberculosis activity. The effect of MSH on drug susceptible MBT was bactericidal. The effect of MSH on the drug resistant MBT (with the isoniazid MIC of 1 mcg/ml) was bactericidal in 75% of the cases and bacteriostatic in 25% of the cases. With the use of MBT resistant to isoniazid in a concentration of 10 mcg/ml the antituberculosis effect was observed in 47% of the cases. The complex treatment of 102 patients with destructive forms of tuberculosis in a daily dose of 800-1200 mg for 2-5 months provided significant clinicoroentgenologic positive dynamics of the process in 75% of the patients. The destructive cavities closed up in 30% of the patients and reduction of the destruction dimentions up to 0.5-2 cm was stated in 45% of the patients. In the control group of 40 patients insignificant dynamics of the destructive processes was observed only in 40% of the patients. Satisfactory tolerability of the drug was registered.

Urology,"Genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) is the second most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, with more than 90% of cases occurring in developing countries. Postmortem studies--from before anti-TB therapy was available--have provided insight into the prevalence and natural history of the disease. In GUTB, the kidneys are the most common sites of infection and are infected through hematogenous spread of the bacilli, which then spread through the renal and genital tract. Diagnosis of TB is often delayed owing to the nonspecific nature of its presentation; therefore, a high degree of suspicion should be exercised and a systematic approach should be taken during investigation. Appropriate culture samples should be obtained to tailor treatment. Standard treatment should be administered for 6 months; quadruple therapy for 2 months and dual therapy for 4 months. However, additional drugs and prolonged treatment are required if drug resistance occurs. Although the role of surgery in GUTB has decreased since the advent of anti-TB therapy, it can still have a role as an adjunct to drug treatment.

22123447,Old wine in new bottles: vitamin D in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis.,,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of mortality, responsible for 1·68 million deaths worldwide in 2009. The global prevalence of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is estimated to be 32%, and this carries a 5-20% lifetime risk of reactivation disease. The emergence of drug-resistant organisms necessitates the development of new agents to enhance the response to antimicrobial therapy for active TB. Vitamin D was used to treat TB in the pre-antibiotic era, and its active metabolite, 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, has long been known to enhance the immune response to mycobacteria in vitro. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with active TB, and several clinical trials have evaluated the role of adjunctive vitamin D supplementation in its treatment. Results of these studies are conflicting, reflecting variation between studies in baseline vitamin D status of participants, dosing regimens and outcome measures. Vitamin D deficiency is also recognised to be highly prevalent among people with latent M. tuberculosis infection in both high- and low-burden settings, and there is a wealth of observational epidemiological evidence linking vitamin D deficiency with increased risk of reactivation disease. Randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of active TB have yet to be performed, however. The conduct of such trials is a research priority, given the safety and low cost of vitamin D supplementation, and the potentially huge public health consequences of positive results.",,,,2011-11-30,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

A prospective study of 29 MDR-TB treatment failure patients (16 with laboratory-proven extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB and the remaining 13 with MDR-TB with resistance to any quinolone but sensitive to injectables) was carried out in Delhi, India. All patients received daily unsupervised therapy with linezolid, one injectable agent, one fluoroquinolone and two or more other drugs. Patients received a median of six anti-mycobacterial agents. Besides linezolid, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and amoxycillin-clavulanic acid were used in 41.4%, 58.6%, 41.4%, and 79.3% of patients.

21930879,Impact of Fgd1 and ddn diversity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex on in vitro susceptibility to PA-824.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"PA-824 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). It is in phase II clinical trials as part of the first newly designed regimen containing multiple novel antituberculosis drugs (PA-824 in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide). However, given that the genes involved in resistance against PA-824 are not fully conserved in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), this regimen might not be equally effective against different MTBC genotypes. To investigate this question, we sequenced two PA-824 resistance genes (fgd1 [Rv0407] and ddn [Rv3547]) in 65 MTBC strains representing major phylogenetic lineages. The MICs of representative strains were determined using the modified proportion method in the Bactec MGIT 960 system. Our analysis revealed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in both genes that were specific either for several genotypes or for individual strains, yet none of these mutations significantly affected the PA-824 MICs (≤ 0.25 μg/ml). These results were supported by in silico modeling of the mutations identified in Fgd1. In contrast, ""Mycobacterium canettii"" strains displayed a higher MIC of 8 μg/ml. In conclusion, we found a large genetic diversity in PA-824 resistance genes that did not lead to elevated PA-824 MICs. In contrast, M. canettii strains had MICs that were above the plasma concentrations of PA-824 documented so far in clinical trials. As M. canettii is also intrinsically resistant against pyrazinamide, new regimens containing PA-824 and pyrazinamide might not be effective in treating M. canettii infections. This finding has implications for the design of multiple ongoing clinical trials.",,,,2011-09-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We combined drug susceptibility results and molecular strain typing data with treatment outcome reports to assess the influence of drug resistance on TB treatment outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients from Abkhazia (Georgia). Patients received individualized treatment regimens based on drug susceptibility testing (DST) results. Definitions for antituberculosis drug resistance and treatment outcomes were in line with current WHO recommendations. First and second line DST, and molecular typing were performed in a supranational laboratory for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains from consecutive sputum smear-positive TB patients at baseline and during treatment.

Owing to slow elimination of the drug, no (14)C label was used within this study. Quantification of the bromine species was accomplished using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS) in combination with on-line isotope dilution (on-line ID), while structural elucidation of the species was performed using HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The ICP-MS-based method developed shows a good intra- and inter-day reproducibility (relative standard deviation = 3.5%, N = 9); the limit of detection (1.5 mg TMC207 L(-1)) is of the same order of magnitude as that for HPLC/radiodetection; the dynamic range of the method covers more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the column recovery was demonstrated to be quantitative (recoveries between 90.6% and 99.5%).

However, its utility for routine TB screening and detection of rifampicin resistance among HIV-infected patients with advanced immunodeficiency enrolling in antiretroviral therapy (ART) services is unknown.
Consecutive adult HIV-infected patients with no current TB diagnosis enrolling in an ART clinic in a South African township were recruited regardless of symptoms. They were clinically characterised and invited to provide two sputum samples at a single visit. The accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for diagnosing TB and drug resistance was assessed in comparison with other tests, including fluorescence smear microscopy and automated liquid culture (gold standard) and drug susceptibility testing. Of 515 patients enrolled, 468 patients (median CD4 cell count, 171 cells/µl; interquartile range, 102-236) produced at least one sputum sample, yielding complete sets of results from 839 samples. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 81 patients (TB prevalence, 17.3%). The overall sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for culture-positive TB was 73.3% (specificity, 99.2%) compared to 28.0% (specificity, 100%) using smear microscopy. All smear-positive, culture-positive disease was detected by Xpert MTB/RIF from a single sample (sensitivity, 100%), whereas the sensitivity for smear-negative, culture-positive TB was 43.4% from one sputum sample and 62.3% from two samples. Xpert correctly identified rifampicin resistance in all four cases of multidrug-resistant TB but incorrectly identified resistance in three other patients whose disease was confirmed to be drug sensitive by gene sequencing (specificity, 94.1%; positive predictive value, 57%).
In this population of individuals at high risk of TB, intensive screening using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay increased case detection by 45% compared with smear microscopy, strongly supporting replacement of microscopy for this indication.

DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 and IL-12 was delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope. M. TB, MDR-TB or extremenly drug resistant (XDR-TB) was injected i.v. into DBA/1 mice, and treated with the vaccine three times. This HVJ-E/Hsp65DNA+IL-12DNA vaccine provided strong therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB and XDR-TB (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB) in mice. Therapeutic effect of this vaccine on TB infection was also demonstrated in chronic TB infection murine model using aerosol infection intratracheally. On the other hand, granulysin protein produced from CTL has lethal activity against TB. Granulysin protein vaccine also exerted strong therapeutic effect. Furthermore, we extended our studies to monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human TB. Hsp65DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine exerted strong therapeutic efficacy (100% survival and augmentation of immune responses) in the TB-infected monkeys. In contrast, the survival of the saline control group was 60% at 16 week post-challenge. HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine increased the body weight of TB-infected monkeys, improved the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and augmentated the immune responses (proliferation of PBL and IL-2 production). The enhancement of IL-2 production from monkeys treated with this vaccine was correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine.

21521704,Clinical experience with linezolid in infants and children.,,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,"The worldwide spread of multidrug-resistant organisms has required the development of new antimicrobials. Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone, has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including resistant strains. Although approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002, the clinical experience with linezolid in the paediatric population is still limited, also given the fact that in most European countries the paediatric use of linezolid is off-label. In this paper we summarize the actual evidence on both licensed and off-label clinical uses of linezolid in children, including efficacy, safety and tolerability issues. Taking into account the potential bias in comparing heterogeneous clinical trials and reports, the available literature data suggest that linezolid is a safe and effective agent for the treatment of serious Gram-positive bacterial infections in neonates and children. At present, linezolid is reserved for those children who are intolerant to or fail conventional agents. A linezolid-containing regimen can be a valuable option for treating multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in children as well as disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. Given the rare occurrence of serious side effects, careful monitoring of haematological parameters, possible drug interactions and neurological manifestations is recommended in linezolid-treated children, especially in case of prolonged treatments. Appropriate linezolid dosage and hospital infection control measures are essential to avoid the spread of linezolid resistance. Further studies are needed to establish novel paediatric indications for linezolid use and to assess the tolerability of long-term treatments.",,,,2011-05-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We aimed to assess operational feasibility, accuracy, and effectiveness of implementation in such settings.
We assessed adults (≥18 years) with suspected tuberculosis or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis consecutively presenting with cough lasting at least 2 weeks to urban health centres in South Africa, Peru, and India, drug-resistance screening facilities in Azerbaijan and the Philippines, and an emergency room in Uganda. Patients were excluded from the main analyses if their second sputum sample was collected more than 1 week after the first sample, or if no valid reference standard or MTB/RIF test was available. We compared one-off direct MTB/RIF testing in nine microscopy laboratories adjacent to study sites with 2-3 sputum smears and 1-3 cultures, dependent on site, and drug-susceptibility testing. We assessed indicators of robustness including indeterminate rate and between-site performance, and compared time to detection, reporting, and treatment, and patient dropouts for the techniques used.
We enrolled 6648 participants between Aug 11, 2009, and June 26, 2010. One-off MTB/RIF testing detected 933 (90·3%) of 1033 culture-confirmed cases of tuberculosis, compared with 699 (67·1%) of 1041 for microscopy. MTB/RIF test sensitivity was 76·9% in smear-negative, culture-positive patients (296 of 385 samples), and 99·0% specific (2846 of 2876 non-tuberculosis samples). MTB/RIF test sensitivity for rifampicin resistance was 94·4% (236 of 250) and specificity was 98·3% (796 of 810). Unlike microscopy, MTB/RIF test sensitivity was not significantly lower in patients with HIV co-infection. Median time to detection of tuberculosis for the MTB/RIF test was 0 days (IQR 0-1), compared with 1 day (0-1) for microscopy, 30 days (23-43) for solid culture, and 16 days (13-21) for liquid culture. Median time to detection of resistance was 20 days (10-26) for line-probe assay and 106 days (30-124) for conventional drug-susceptibility testing. Use of the MTB/RIF test reduced median time to treatment for smear-negative tuberculosis from 56 days (39-81) to 5 days (2-8). The indeterminate rate of MTB/RIF testing was 2·4% (126 of 5321 samples) compared with 4·6% (441 of 9690) for cultures.
The MTB/RIF test can effectively be used in low-resource settings to simplify patients' access to early and accurate diagnosis, thereby potentially decreasing morbidity associated with diagnostic delay, dropout and mistreatment.

Some of these were then applied to three small studies: one of a single injected dose of heat-killed, borate-buffered Mycobacterium vaccae administered early in treatment, another of three such doses administered at monthly intervals from the start of treatment, and the third of ten oral doses at frequent intervals throughout short-course chemotherapy. All three displayed better clearance of bacilli from the sputum, faster improvement in clinical symptoms, better radiological resolution of lesions and a return of most immunological parameters towards those of healthy persons. In principle, the immune change achieved is an increase in Th1 mechanisms, notably IL-2 and -12 with downregulation of the tissue damaging aspects of Th2.

It accounts for approximately 8-9 million new cases worldwide and an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually. Effective treatments for tuberculosis consist of a combination of several drugs administered over long periods of time. Since Mycobacterium tuberculosis often acquires multiple drug resistant mechanisms, development of new drugs with innovative actions is urgently required. The 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, in charge of the essential biosynthesis of isoprenoids, represents a promising and selective target for developing new drugs against tuberculosis. To date, only fosmidomycin, a molecule that targets the second enzyme of the MEP pathway, has reached clinical trials but recent advances elucidating the structure and kinetics of the MEP enzymes are likely to change this scenario. This review describes the structure, mechanism of action and inhibitors of the seven enzymes of the MEP pathway, with special attention to the reported studies in M. tuberculosis.",,,,2011-03-04,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
21357997,[Vaccination against M. tuberculosis - what next after BCG?].,,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),"Tuberculosis (TB) still remains a huge global health problem. An increase in TB has been observed in many parts of the world, especially in poor and densely populated sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Tuberculosis affects not only the developing countries but also the relatively wealthy regions of Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, where drug-resistant mycobacterial strains are increasingly reported. Control of tuberculosis expansion is very difficult. It requires the long-term use of anti-mycobacterial drugs. Additionally, the HIV epidemic and the phenomenon of multi-drug resistance are assumed to be responsible for the increase in TB cases. Therefore the most reasonable form of anti-TB protection seems to be effective vaccination. At the beginning of the twentieth century the BCG vaccine was introduced into general use as the first and so far the only immune protector against tuberculosis. Now it is known that this vaccine is not powerful enough and induces protection at a relatively low level. Hence ongoing research on the development of a more powerful anti-mycobacterial vaccine is still needed. Many of the new formulations are in phase II or III of clinical trials and the results are promising. The search for new vaccines involves several strategies: modified virulence-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, recombination of attenuated M. bovis BCG bacilli, immunogenic mycobacterial proteins and DNA encoding selected proteins as well as unrelated microorganisms used as carriers of mycobacterial antigens. The wide range of concepts is extremely important because new vaccines should serve for immunization of the broadest possible population, not only healthy individuals but also those who are immunocompromised.",,,,2011-03-02,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen responsible for TB, uses diverse strategies to survive in a variety of host lesions and to evade immune surveillance. A key question is how robust are our approaches to discovering new TB drugs, and what measures could be taken to reduce the long and protracted clinical development of new drugs. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis makes the discovery of new molecular scaffolds a priority, and the current situation even necessitates the re-engineering and repositioning of some old drug families to achieve effective control. Whatever the strategy used, success will depend largely on our proper understanding of the complex interactions between the pathogen and its human host.

While drug sensitive TB is completely curable, MDR-TB is difficult to treat, XDR and TDR are often fatal. Non availability of new drugs to treat drug resistant cases further complicates the problem. The Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Developments, a non-profit organization with the World Health Organization (WHO) as a partner was formed in February 2000 for the development of new drugs. In the last decade this venture has resulted in several promising new antituberculosis drugs like TMC207 (diaryquinoline), PA-824 (nitroimidazo-oxazine), OPC-67683 (nitroimidazo-oxazole) and SQ 109 (diamine compound). Drug resistance in TB is a man made problem. Therefore, while global efforts towards new drug development must continue it is equally important to have a well defined community approach to prevent the emergence of drug resistance to the existing and newer drugs.

While TB cases are constantly declining in industrialized countries, the rates and mortality due to this infection in developing countries remain alarming and will continue to be so in the future. Although the priorities in these countries are at present simpler, methods allowing rapid diagnosis of TB and of resistant strains will obviously contribute to better control of the disease. Nucleic acid amplification techniques allow M. tuberculosis detection in clinical samples in a few hours, while liquid media cultures may yield positive results in only 2 to 4 weeks, half the time that is usually required for growth in conventional solid media, which also allows more rapid determination of drug susceptibilities. Similarly, based on molecular biology, several approaches may rapidly identify gene mutations associated with resistance to antituberculosis drugs in clinical samples.

Their efficacy has been substantiated by clinical trials and tuberculosis control programmes, notwithstanding the lack of head-to-head comparison between daily and intermittent regimens. Recently, there has been opposing evidence from observational studies, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies and animal models that intermittent treatment increases the risk of relapse, treatment failure or acquired rifamycin resistance, especially among HIV-infected patients. Systematic reviews have been conflicting. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for publications in English to evaluate the evidence about dosing schedules and treatment efficacy.

Among culture-positive patients, a single, direct MTB/RIF test identified 551 of 561 patients with smear-positive tuberculosis (98.2%) and 124 of 171 with smear-negative tuberculosis (72.5%). The test was specific in 604 of 609 patients without tuberculosis (99.2%). Among patients with smear-negative, culture-positive tuberculosis, the addition of a second MTB/RIF test increased sensitivity by 12.6 percentage points and a third by 5.1 percentage points, to a total of 90.2%. As compared with phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing, MTB/RIF testing correctly identified 200 of 205 patients (97.6%) with rifampin-resistant bacteria and 504 of 514 (98.1%) with rifampin-sensitive bacteria.

20693257,Treatment of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis: update 2010.,,The European respiratory journal,"Much remains unknown about latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Existing immunodiagnostic tools for this condition have various limitations, most importantly in their ability to predict disease. Randomised controlled trials have established protective efficacy of isoniazid therapy for 6-12 months among non-HIV-infected and HIV-infected subjects. While efficacy may reach 90%, acceptance and adherence to prolonged therapy are less than desired. Rifampicin plus pyrazinamide for 2 months, though efficacious, has been associated with excess hepatotoxicity in non-HIV-infected persons. Isoniazid plus rifampicin for 3 months has proven efficacy, but adverse effects may be more frequent than isoniazid or rifampicin monotherapy. Rifampicin monotherapy for 3-4 months is well tolerated, but efficacy data are currently limited, and concerns remain over possible selection of rifampicin-resistant mutants. For contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, expert opinions differ on whether to treat with at least two drugs or just a fluoroquinolone, and for how long. With the existing diagnostic and treatment tools, efficacy of preventive therapy does not necessarily translate into field effectiveness. A targeted approach is required to maximise cost-effectiveness.

However, no novel vaccine for clinical use has not yet been developed in the world including U.S.A. and Europe. We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine; a combination of the DNA vaccines expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope and -liposome (HSP65+IL-12/HVJ). This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65+IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100% survival). Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys. These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials. The review also provides recent advances of the precise studies of induction of immunity including CD8 positive cytotoxic T cells and effector molecules such as granulysin by these vaccines, against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and extremely drug resistant tuberculosis.",,,,2010-07-29,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Linezolid is a promising drug, but its use is limited by adverse effects with prolonged administration of 600 mg twice daily. In order to reduce its adverse effects and maintain efficacy, we investigated whether linezolid in a reduced dosage resulted in drug serum concentrations exceeding a ratio of the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC(24)) [AUC(24)/MIC] of >100.
This open-label, prospective pharmacokinetic study evaluated two doses (300 and 600 mg) of linezolid in MDR-TB patients, who received linezolid as part of their treatment. They received linezolid 300 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 600 mg twice daily. Blood samples taken at predefined intervals for measuring serum linezolid concentrations were processed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry procedure. The AUC(24)/MIC ratio was used as a predictive model of efficacy. Adverse effects of linezolid, including peripheral neuropathy, were evaluated by clinical and laboratory assessments.
Eight patients were included in this study. The median duration of linezolid treatment was 56 days (interquartile range [IQR 44-82] days), with a median cumulative dose of 51,000 mg (IQR 33,850-60,450 mg). The median linezolid AUC over 12 hours (AUC(12)) values were 57.6 mg x h/L (IQR 38.5-64.2 mg x h/L) with the 300 mg dose and 145.8 mg x h/L (IQR 101.2-160.9 mg x h/L) with the 600 mg dose.

There is general agreement that new anti-TB drugs are needed to shorten or otherwise simplify treatment for drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant-TB, including TB associated with HIV infection. For the first time in over 40 years, a nascent pipeline of new anti-TB drug candidates has been assembled. Eleven candidates from seven classes are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. They include novel chemical entities belonging to entirely new classes of antibacterials, agents approved for use against infections other than TB, and an agent already approved for limited use against TB.

20521931,TMC207: the first compound of a new class of potent anti-tuberculosis drugs.,,Future microbiology,"Disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues as a global epidemic: over 2 billion people harbor latent TB infection, and more than 9 million new TB cases, of whom 500,000 are multidrug-resistant (MDR), and nearly 2 million deaths are estimated to occur each year. New drugs are required to shorten treatment duration of drug-sensitive TB and for the treatment of MDR-TB. TMC207 is a first-in-class diarylquinoline compound with a novel mechanism of action, the inhibition of bacterial ATP synthase, and potent activity against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. It has bactericidal and sterilizing activity against M. tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species, but little activity against other bacteria. In a Phase II efficacy study conducted in patients with MDR-TB taking TMC207 plus a standard background regimen, the drug appeared to be safe and well tolerated, and showed significant efficacy after 2 months of treatment with conversion rates of sputum culture of 48% (vs 9% in the placebo group). Given the product development partnership between Tibotec and the TB Alliance, the strategies of using TMC207 in shorter first-line regimens or using it in second-line regimens for drug-resistant M. tuberculosis infections are both being pursued. No clinical data of TMC207 in TB patients with HIV coinfection have been published; drug-drug interaction studies with antiretrovirals are being conducted. Finally, the remarkable sterilizing capacity of TMC207 also makes it an attractive drug in the strategy of TB elimination. Current and future studies will determine the role of TMC207 in a shortened treatment regimen for drug-sensitive TB, a more effective and better-tolerated regimen for MDR-TB, the treatment of latent TB infection, and intermittent-TB treatment regimens.",,,,2010-06-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

20488525,Early treatment outcomes and HIV status of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa: a retrospective cohort study.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Data from Kwazulu Natal, South Africa, suggest that almost all patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are HIV-positive, with a fatal outcome. Since, there are few data for the treatment-related outcomes of XDR tuberculosis in settings with a high HIV prevalence, we investigated the associations of these diseases in such settings to formulate recommendations for control programmes.
In a retrospective cohort study, we analysed the case records of patients (>16 years old) with XDR tuberculosis (culture-proven at diagnosis) between August, 2002, and February, 2008, at four designated provincial treatment facilities in South Africa. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess risk factors associated with the outcomes-mortality and culture conversion.
195 of 227 patients were analysed. 21 died before initiation of any treatment, and 174 patients (82 with HIV infection) were treated. 62 (36%) of these patients died during follow-up. The number of deaths was not significantly different in patients with or without HIV infection: 34 (41%) of 82 versus 28 (30%) of 92 (p=0.13). Treatment with moxifloxacin (hazard ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.82; p=0.03), previous culture-proven multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (5.21, 1.93-14.1; p=0.001), and number of drugs used in a regimen (0.59, 0.45-0.78, p<0.0001) were independent predictors of death. Fewer deaths occurred in patients with HIV infection given highly active antiretroviral therapy than in those who were not (0.38, 0.18-0.80; p=0.01). 33 (19%) of 174 patients showed culture conversion, of which 23 (70%) converted within 6 months of initiation of treatment.
In South Africa, patients with XDR tuberculosis, a substantial proportion of whom are not infected with HIV, have poor management outcomes. Nevertheless, survival in patients with HIV infection is better than previously reported. The priorities for the country are still prevention of XDR tuberculosis, and early detection and management of multidrug-resistant and XDR tuberculosis through strengthened programmes and laboratory capacity.

Diagnosis of DR-TB relies on drug susceptibility testing (DST), which is not routinely performed in high tuberculosis (TB) burden settings. The Category II retreatment regimen is inadequate for Category I failures if multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is present. Where possible, DST should be performed for Category I failures and other patients with a high risk of DR-TB. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) should be used with caution in the treatment of mono- and polyresistant TB. Modification of regimens for mono- and polyresistance is prone to error if DST results are not reliable or if there is possible additional drug resistance due to further drug exposure. While standardised treatment is feasible for MDR-TB patients never previously treated with second-line drugs, a different strategy is required for those MDR-TB patients who have previously been treated with second-line drugs. Sputum conversion, adverse effects and adherence to MDR-TB treatment should be monitored closely. The presence of FQ resistance prior to MDR-TB treatment poses a serious challenge. To prevent the development of extensively drug-resistant TB, strategies to protect the FQs, the most important second-line agents, need to be developed. Clinical trials assessing MDR-TB treatment regimens are urgently needed.",,,,2010-05-22,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In many ways, multidrug-resistant TB is a result of this disregard. In high-burden countries, not many improvements have been implemented in the diagnosis and treatment tools of TB since the 1960s. Following this period, fluoroquinolones, developed for other infections, are the only highly active new drugs against TB. Multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant TB is booming worldwide as a result of insufficient control measures. Furthermore, the prevalence of this disease is substantially facilitated by the HIV epidemic. After a deadly and well-reported extensively drug-resistant TB outbreak occurred in HIV-infected patients in South Africa, the threat of an untreatable TB epidemic is receiving increased attention internationally. Nevertheless, drug-resistant management has lacked research and funding over several decades and we are now faced with many controversial issues and little research-based evidence. There are no clinical trials comparing different treatments, and current management is based on personal experiences and agreement between experts. The major challenge for the next few years is to improve the evidence base in order to develop more rational recommendations that adequately address the current problem and avoid making a bad situation worse.",,,,2010-05-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

It is anticipated that 10% of these infected individuals will develop active tuberculosis at some point in their lifetime. The long-term use of the current drug regimen, the emergence of drug-resistant strains, and HIV co-infection have resulted in a resurgence of research efforts to address the urgent need for new anti-tuberculosis drugs. A number of potential candidate drugs with novel modes of action have entered clinical trials in recent years, and these are likely to be effective against anti-tuberculosis drug-resistant strains. They include neuroquinolone derivatives, a modified ethambutol, nitro-imidazole groups and so on.

Treatment of MDR-TB is complex, prolonged, expensive and requires appropriate clinical and laboratory infrastructure. The majority of MDR-TB patients still do not have access to adequate diagnostic services or quality assured second-line drugs, leading to high levels of morbidity and mortality. More effective and efficient MDR-TB treatment with reduced toxicity that could be safely delivered to patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an urgent research priority that could be cost-saving for health systems overall. In this context, understanding how best to design and execute randomised controlled trials to improve MDR-TB treatment has taken on new urgency, to identify the optimal combination(s) of existing and new drugs to assemble in efficient and safe regimen(s), preferably of short duration, that can be easily delivered to patients and safely combined with antiretroviral treatment. In the present report, we address the methodological issues in the design and execution of Phase II and Phase III trials arising from this goal. We suggest that a rational selection of appropriate designs and outcome measures, associated with the application of new diagnostic technology, could overcome many of the methodological and logistical problems. These advances could be key to historic improvements in the treatment of patients suffering from MDR-TB, and perhaps ultimately drug-susceptible TB.

As a result of limited treatment options, patients have a poor prognosis and low chances of cure. This situation can be exacerbated by HIV epidemics. In some cases, the risk exists of a real shift from susceptible to resistant strains. Despite its relevance, currently there are more contradictions and confusion surrounding MDR-TB than hard evidence. No randomized controlled trials have been performed and published evidence is limited. Rather than just the selection of expensive drugs, MDR-TB management requires well-structured programmes with a comprehensive approach, which involve the actions of a wide range of participants. Even with current investments in research and development, new drugs and vaccines will take many years to be applied in low and middle income countries. The most successful results will depend on the optimization of existing tools. The majority of the patients, even those with extensive patterns of bacilli resistance, have a possibility of cure if current clinical knowledge and effective logistics are applied.

Coinfection with HIV leads to difficulties in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, more sensitive tests-such as liquid culture systems, nucleic acid amplification assays, and detection of mycobacterial products in various body fluids-are being investigated. The treatment of coinfected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution syndrome. Both multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis can spread rapidly among an immunocompromised population, with resulting high mortality rates.

There are currently at least ten drugs being evaluated in clinical trials. Some belong to chemical classes already employed in first- or second-line treatment regimens and are being explored for more optimized use at higher doses or in new drug combinations (rifamycins, fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones), while others represent potential novel members of the TB drug arsenal, killing Mycobacterium tuberculosis through previously untried mechanisms of action (nitroimidazoles, diarylquinolines, ethylene diamines and pyrroles). The typical challenges of drug development are augmented in TB by the complexity of the disease, the requirement for multi-drug regimens, the relative lack of TB drug development for the past several decades, and inadequate resources being brought to bear despite the urgency of the global medical need. Yet in the face of these challenges, for the first time in history, there is a robust enough pipeline of drugs in development to potentially enable identification of a novel, three-drug regimen capable of curing patients in three months or less, whether they are infected with a strain of M. tuberculosis sensitive or resistant to the current first and second-line drugs.

Isoxyl has been used exclusively, but infrequently, via the oral route and has exhibited very poor and highly variable bioavailability due to its sparing solubility in water. These properties resulted in failure of some clinical trials and, consequently, isoxyl's use has been limited. Delivery of isoxyl to the lungs, a major site of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, is an attractive alternative route of administration that may rescue this abandoned drug for a disease that urgently requires new therapies. Particles for pulmonary delivery were prepared by antisolvent precipitation. Nanofibers with a width of 200 nm were obtained by injecting isoxyl solution in ethanol to water at a volume ratio of solvent to antisolvent of 1:5. Based on this preliminary result, a well-controlled method, involving nozzle mixing, was employed to prepare isoxyl particles. All the particles were 200 to 400 nm in width but had different lengths depending on properties of the solvents. However, generating these nanoparticles by simultaneous spray drying produced isoxyl microparticles (Feret's diameter, 1.19-1.77 microm) with no discernible nanoparticle substructure. The bulking agent, mannitol, helped to prevent these nanoparticles from agglomeration during process and resulted in nanoparticle aggregates in micron-sized superstructures.

Anti-TB drugs impose selection pressure so that mycobacterial mutants gradually outnumber susceptible bacilli and emerge as the dominant strains. Resistance to two or more anti-TB drugs represents cumulative results of sequential mutation. The fourth report on global anti-TB drug resistance provides the latest data on the extent of such problem in the world. The median prevalence of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in new TB cases was 1.6%, and in previously treated TB cases 11.7%. Of the half a million MDR-TB cases estimated to have emerged in 2006, 50% were in China and India. The optimal duration of any given combination of anti-TB drugs for treatment of MDR- and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has not been defined in controlled clinical trials. Standardized treatment may be feasible for MDR-TB patients not previously treated with second-line drugs, but a different strategy needs to be applied in the treatment of MDR-TB patients who have received second-line drugs before. Unfortunately, the reliability of drug susceptibility testing of most second-line anti-TB drugs is still questionable. Drug-resistant TB is not necessarily less virulent. Findings from modelling exercise warned that if MDR-TB case detection and treatment rates increase to the World Health Organization target of 70%, without simultaneously increasing MDR-TB cure rates, XDR-TB prevalence could increase exponentially.

20231995,"Increasing pathomorphism of pulmonary tuberculosis: an observational study of slow clinical, microbiological and imaging response of lung tuberculosis to specific treatment. Which role for linezolid?",,The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,"During recent years, a progressive emerging of tuberculosis occurred, related to the overall increased age of general population, primary and secondary (iatrogenic) immunodeficiencies, the availability of invasive procedures, surgical interventions and intensive care supports, bone marrow and solid organ transplantation, and especially the recent immigration flows of people often coming from areas endemic for tuberculosis, and living with evident social-economical disadvantages, and with a reduced access to health care facilities. Since January 2006, at our reference centre we followed 81 consecutive cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, with 65 of them which remained evaluable for the absence of extrapulmonary complications, and a continuative and effective clinical and therapeutic follow-up. The majority of episodes of evaluable pulmonary tuberculosis (49 cases out of 65: 75,4%) occurred in patients who immigrated from developing countries. In two patients multiresistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were found, while two more subjects (both immigrated from Eastern Europe) suffered from a disease due to extremely resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis strains. Although enforcing all possible measures to increase patients' adherence to treatment (empowerment, delivery of oral drugs under direct control, use of i.v. formulation whenever possible), over 72% of evaluable patients had a very slow clinical, microbiological, and imaging ameliorement (1-6 months), with persistance of sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid positive for M.tuberculosis microscopy and/or culture for over 1-4 months (mean 9.2+/-3.2 weeks), during an apparently adequate treatment. When excluding patients suffering from XDR and MDR tuberculosis, in four subjects we observed that off-label linezolid adjunct together with at least three drugs with residual activity against tuberculosis, led to a significantly more rapid clinical-radiological improvement and negative microbiological search, with consequent possibility to led to a protected discharge, supported by a sequential, oral therapy. Linezolid was also successfully employed in all the four patients with XDR or MDR pulmonary tuberculosis: among these patients, a definitive or temporarily negativization of respiratory secretions, and consequent discharge, was achieved only after linezolid adjunct. Notwithstanding the maintained microbiological susceptibility of M. tuberculosis strains responsible of the great majority of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis to first-line drugs, an unexpected tendency of patients to have a persistingly positive sputum and/or BAL, and to experience prolonged hospitalization for cure and isolation, has been recognized in the last years. No particularly suggestive radiological imaging seems predictive of a so prolonged course, so that we presently lack of clinical and imaging elements which may be predictive of this slow treatment response. The same is for demographic and epidemiological issues, eventual underlying diseases, and clinical presentation, so that a major problem for health care providers is to distinguish upon admission patients who will be prone to have slow therapeutic response and a related prolonged hospitalization. The novel oxazolidinone linezolid is characterized by an affordable in vitro activity against M. tuberculosis, and an extremely elevated intracellular concentration in respiratory tissues. Worldwide, increasing microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical evidences may recommend the use as linezolid adjunct as an off-label salvage treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis refractory to treatment, although not necessarily determined by resistant (MDR-XDR) M. tuberculosis strains.

Strains resistant to both INH and RIF are termed multidrug-resistant (MDR). Treatment options for MDR patients involve a complex array of twenty different drugs only two classes of which are considered to be highly effective (fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides). Resistance to these two classes results in strains known as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and these types of infections are becoming increasingly common. Many of the remaining agents have poorly defined pharmacology but nonetheless are widely used in the treatment of this disease. Several of these agents are known to have highly variable exposures in healthy volunteers and little is known in the patients in which they must be used. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is infrequently used in the management of MDR or XDR disease yet the clinical pharmacokinetic studies that have been done suggest this might have a large impact on disease outcome. We review what is known about the pharmacologic properties of each of the major classes of second- and third-line antituberculosis agents and suggest where judicious use of TDM would have the maximum possible impact. We summarize the state of knowledge of drug-drug interactions (DDI) in these classes of agents and those that are currently in clinical trials. Finally we consider what little is known about the ability of TB drugs to reach their ultimate site of action--the interior of a granuloma by penetrating the diseased lung area. Careful consideration of the pharmacology of these agents is essential if we are to avoid further fueling the growing epidemic of highly drug-resistant TB and critical in the development of new antituberculosis drugs.",,,,2010-02-17,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We conducted a systematic review of published evidence of treatment of patients with a history of previous treatment or documented isoniazid mono-resistance.
PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central database for clinical trials were searched for randomized trials in previously treated patients and/or those with with mono-resistance to isoniazid, published in English, French, or Spanish between 1965 and June 2008. The first two sources were also searched for cohort studies evaluating specifically the current retreatment regimen. In studies selected for inclusion, rifampin-containing regimens were used to treat patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB, in whom bacteriologically confirmed failure and/or relapse had been reported. Pooled cumulative incidences and 95% CIs of treatment outcomes were computed with random effects meta-analyses and negative binomial regression. No randomized trials of the currently recommended retreatment regimen were identified. Only six cohort studies were identified, in which failure rates were 18%–44% in those with isoniazid resistance. In nine trials, using very different regimens in previously treated patients with mono-resistance to isoniazid, the combined failure and relapse rates ranged from 0% to over 75%. From pooled analysis of 33 trials in 1,907 patients with mono-resistance to isoniazid, lower failure, relapse, and acquired drug resistance rates were associated with longer duration of rifampin, use of streptomycin, daily therapy initially, and treatment with a greater number of effective drugs.
There are few published studies to support use of the current standardized retreatment regimen. Randomized trials of treatment of persons with isoniazid mono-resistance and/or a history of previous TB treatment are urgently needed.
Performing a systematic review of studies evaluating retreatment of tuberculosis or treatment of isoniazid mono-resistant infection, Dick Menzies and colleagues find a paucity of evidence to support the WHO-recommended regimen.
Every year, nearly ten million people develop tuberculosis—a contagious infection, usually of the lungs—and about 2 million people die from the disease. Tuberculosis is caused by 
As part of its strategy to reduce the global burden of tuberculosis, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends standardized treatment regimens for tuberculosis. For re-treatment, WHO recommends an 8-month course of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol with pyrazinamide and streptomycin added for the first 3 and 2 months, respectively. All these drugs are given daily (the preferred regimen) or three times a week. Unfortunately, although this regimen is now used to treat about 1 million patients each year, it yields poor results, particularly in regions where drug resistance is common. In this study (which was commissioned by WHO to provide the evidence needed for a revision of its treatment guidelines), the researchers undertake a systematic review (a search using specific criteria to identify relevant research studies, which are then appraised) and a meta-analysis (a statistical approach that pools the results of several studies) of randomized trials and cohort studies (two types of study that investigate the efficacy of medical interventions) of re-treatment regimens in previously treated tuberculosis patients, and in patients with infection that was resistant to isoniazid (“mono-resistance”).
The researchers' systematic search for published reports of randomized trials and cohort studies of the currently recommended re-treatment regimen identified no relevant randomized trials and only six cohort studies. In the three cohort studies in which the participants carried 
These findings reveal that there is very little published evidence that supports the regimen currently recommended by WHO for the re-treatment of tuberculosis. Furthermore, this limited body of evidence is a patchwork of results gleaned from a few cohort studies and a set of randomized trials not specifically designed to test the efficacy of the standardized regimen. There is an urgent need, therefore, for a concerted international effort to initiate randomized trials of potential treatment regimens in both previously untreated and previously treated patients with all forms of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Because these trials will take some time to complete, the limited findings of the meta-analysis presented here may be used in the meantime to redesign and, hopefully, improve the current standardized re-treatment regimen.

An IL-12 expression vector (IL-12DNA) encoding single-chain IL-12 proteins comprised of p40 and p35 subunits were constructed. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse and guinea pig models compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB in the lung) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. All monkeys in the control group (saline) died within 8 months, while 50% of monkeys in the HSP65+hIL-12/HVJ group survived more than 14 months post-infection (the termination period of the experiment). Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100% survival). In contrast, 33% of monkeys from BCG Tokyo alone group were alive (33% survival). Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys.

20042919,Limited sampling strategies for therapeutic drug monitoring of linezolid in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Therapeutic drug monitoring,"Linezolid is a potential drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis but its use is limited because of severe adverse effects such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy. This study aimed to develop a model for the prediction of linezolid area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12h) by limited sampling strategy to enable individualized dosing.
Fourteen patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis received linezolid twice daily as part of their antituberculosis treatment. Linezolid concentrations were determined at steady state by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after dosing. Linezolid AUC0-12h population model and limited sampling models were calculated with MWPharm software. The correlation between predicted linezolid AUC0-12h and observed linezolid AUC0-12h was investigated by Bland-Altman analysis.
A total of 26 pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained. The median AUC0-12h was 51.8 (interquartile range, 41.8-65.9) mg*h/L at 300 mg and 123.8 (interquartile range, 100.9-152.5) mg*h/L at 600 mg, both twice daily. The most relevant model clinically for prediction of linezolid AUC0-12h used a linezolid trough concentration (r = 0.91, prediction bias = -2.9% and root mean square error = 15%).
The difference between choosing a trough concentration and two to three samples increased the correlation from 0.90 to 0.95 but appeared not clinically relevant because it did not result in different dosing advice.

19925965,Toward an optimized therapy for tuberculosis? Drugs in clinical trials and in preclinical development.,,Clinics in chest medicine,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be one of the greatest challenges in the global public health arena. Current therapeutic agents against TB are old and inadequate, particularly in the face of many new challenges. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has become prevalent in many parts of the world and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is rapidly emerging. There are few or essentially no effective drugs available to treat these drug-resistant forms of TB. TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection has become another major problem in areas with high prevalence of HIV infection. Simultaneous treatment of TB and HIV is difficult due to the severe drug-drug interactions between the first-line rifamycin-containing TB therapy and antiretroviral agents. However, there have been some encouraging developments in TB drug research and development within the past decade. At present there are 6 compounds, including 3 novel agents, in late stages of clinical development. There are even larger numbers of compounds and projects in the TB drug pipeline at the discovery stage and in early stages of clinical development, mainly targeting treatment shortening and drug resistance. Despite these encouraging developments, the current TB drug pipeline is not sufficient to address the multitude of challenges inherent in the current standard of TB therapy. A stronger TB drug pipeline and a new paradigm for the development of novel TB drug combinations are needed.",,,,2009-11-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Patients with HIV-1 and TB were recruited into a clinical trial from two different once-daily antiretroviral regimens and followed for a period of 6 months after ART initiation. Patients were treated with standard short-course anti-TB treatment (2EHRZ3/4RH3) and were randomized to receive ddI/3TC with either nevirapine or efavirenz, once daily. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) testing was carried out for the pol gene at baseline and at the time of virological failure. At baseline, major DRMs with respect to NNRTIs (G190GA) and TAMs (T215S and I) were observed in 3 out of 107 patients. Of 15 treatment failures, 14 had more than one major NRTI and NNRTI mutation. V106M was the major NNRTI mutation that emerged in EFZ and Y181C in the NVP group. Among NRTI mutations, M184V was the commonest followed by L74I/V. Primary drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among HIV-1 co-infected TB patients in south India.

A controlled randomized study of the results of treatment in two groups of patients who had or had not received UVABI during the standard complex therapy was carried out by the experiment-control principle. The groups were randomized (first - second). In 91.9% of the children and adolescents with infiltrative tuberculosis, the process was accompanied by impaired immune defense with bacterial isolation in 68.0 to 54.1% of cases; every two patients had drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The use of UVABI in the complex therapy of patients with tuberculosis was ascertained to promote a rapid, two-fold more frequent bacterial isolation cessation resulting in a epidemic danger reduction in the patients, to have a positive impact on the formation of immune defense, mainly of a phagocytic link, in children and adolescents, to exert a detoxifying effect, to favor a better tolerability of antituberculous drugs, to cause positive X-ray changes, and to improve the quality of life.

19823582,Genomic diversity among drug sensitive and multidrug resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with identical DNA fingerprints.,,PloS one,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is characterized by low sequence diversity making this bacterium one of the classical examples of a genetically monomorphic pathogen. Because of this limited DNA sequence variation, routine genotyping of clinical MTBC isolates for epidemiological purposes relies on highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting methods based on mobile and repetitive genetic elements. According to the standard view, isolates exhibiting the same fingerprinting pattern are considered direct progeny of the same bacterial clone, and most likely reflect ongoing transmission or disease relapse within individual patients.
Here we further investigated this assumption and used massively parallel whole-genome sequencing to compare one drug-susceptible (K-1) and one multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate (K-2) of a rapidly spreading M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype clone from a high incidence region (Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan). Both isolates shared the same IS6110 RFLP pattern and the same allele at 23 out of 24 MIRU-VNTR loci. We generated 23.9 million (K-1) and 33.0 million (K-2) paired 50 bp purity filtered reads corresponding to a mean coverage of 483.5 fold and 656.1 fold respectively. Compared with the laboratory strain H37Rv both Beijing isolates shared 1,209 SNPs. The two Beijing isolates differed by 130 SNPs and one large deletion. The susceptible isolate had 55 specific SNPs, while the MDR variant had 75 specific SNPs, including the five known resistance-conferring mutations.
Our results suggest that M. tuberculosis isolates exhibiting identical DNA fingerprinting patterns can harbour substantial genomic diversity. Because this heterogeneity is not captured by traditional genotyping of MTBC, some aspects of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis could be missed or misinterpreted. Furthermore, a valid differentiation between disease relapse and exogenous reinfection might be impossible using standard genotyping tools if the overall diversity of circulating clones is limited. These findings have important implications for clinical trials of new anti-tuberculosis drugs.",,,,2009-10-14,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We sought to estimate treatment outcomes and identify risk factors associated with poor outcomes in patients with MDRTB.
We performed a systematic search (to December 2008) to identify trials describing outcomes of patients treated for MDRTB. We pooled appropriate data to estimate WHO-defined outcomes at the end of treatment and follow-up. Where appropriate, pooled covariates were analyzed to identify factors associated with worse outcomes. Among articles identified, 36 met our inclusion criteria, representing 31 treatment programmes from 21 countries. In a pooled analysis, 62% [95% CI 57-67] of patients had successful outcomes, while 13% [9]-[17] defaulted, 11% [9]-[13] died, and 2% [1]-[4] were transferred out. Factors associated with worse outcome included male gender 0.61 (OR for successful outcome) [0.46-0.82], alcohol abuse 0.49 [0.39-0.63], low BMI 0.41[0.23-0.72], smear positivity at diagnosis 0.53 [0.31-0.91], fluoroquinolone resistance 0.45 [0.22-0.91] and the presence of an XDR resistance pattern 0.57 [0.41-0.80].

There is, therefore, an urgent global need for an improved vaccine. However, the development of an improved vaccine is scientifically and logistically challenging. Immunological correlates or biomarkers of protection are not known and there is no perfect preclinical animal model with which to predict success in humans. Indeed, vaccine development in general is time-consuming and costly. One of the many road-blocks to the development of new TB vaccines is the availability of field sites that are suitable for large scale Phase IIb/III efficacy testing. Because disease incidence is low, even though prevalence is high, Phase IIb efficacy trials involve several thousand subjects, and require lengthy follow-up. Phase III licensure trials will need to be even larger, and are likely to require the involvement of multiple field sites. There is currently inadequate capacity within high-burden TB countries to conduct these essential trials.

Failure to control TB may be related to the biological characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the nature of susceptible hosts often impoverished and poorly supported by healthcare infrastructure and the complex treatment regimens that must be used. Challenges to anti-TB drug development include the organism's slow replication, the ability of M. tuberculosis to survive in a dormant state and to persist despite therapy, its impregnable cell wall and its capacity to develop resistance to drugs. The need for extended therapy using combinations of drugs remains a practical obstacle to effective control in poor, malnourished and diseased communities most susceptible to TB.

The fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin is a promising new agent that might have additive activity to existing antituberculosis agents. We assessed the activity and safety of moxifloxacin in the initial stage of tuberculosis treatment.
We undertook a phase II, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of a regimen that included moxifloxacin in adults with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis at one hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 170 participants received isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide at standard doses and were assigned by permuted block randomisation to receive either moxifloxacin (400 mg) with an ethambutol placebo (n=85) or ethambutol (15-20 mg/kg) plus moxifloxacin placebo (n=85) 5 days per week for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients whose sputum culture had converted to negative by week 8. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (ITT); patients whose baseline cultures were negative, contaminated, or contained drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, all missing 8-week results were deemed treatment failures. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00082173.
74 patients assigned to the moxifloxacin group and 72 in the ethambutol group were included in the modified ITT population. 125 patients had 8-week data (moxifloxacin n=64, ethambutol n=61); the main reason for absence of data was culture contamination. At 8 weeks, culture conversion to negative had occurred in 59 (80%) of 74 patients in the moxifloxacin group compared with 45 (63%) of 72 in the ethambutol group (difference 17.2%, 95% CI 2.8-31.7; p=0.03). There were 16 adverse events (eight in each group) in 12 patients. Only one event was judged related to study drug (grade 3 cutaneous reaction in the ethambutol group).
Moxifloxacin improved culture conversion in the initial phase of tuberculosis treatment. Trials to assess whether moxifloxacin can be used to shorten the duration of tuberculosis treatment are justified.",,,,2009-04-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Infectious diseases,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is a growing clinical and public-health concern. To evaluate existing evidence regarding treatment regimens for MDR tuberculosis, we used a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis of the available therapeutic studies to assess how the reported proportion of patients treated successfully is influenced by differences in treatment regimen design, study methodology, and patient population. Successful treatment outcome was defined as cure or treatment completion. 34 clinical reports with a mean of 250 patients per report met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis shows that the proportion of patients treated successfully improved when treatment duration was at least 18 months, and if patients received directly observed therapy throughout treatment. Studies that combined both factors had significantly higher pooled success proportions (69%, 95% credible interval [CI] 64-73%) than other studies of treatment outcomes (58%, 95% CI 52-64%). Individualised treatment regimens had higher treatment success (64%, 95% CI 59-68%) than standardised regimens (54%, 95% CI 43-68%), although the difference was not significant. Treatment approaches and study methodologies were heterogeneous across studies. Many important variables, including patients' HIV status, were inconsistently reported between studies.

However, there is no data in pediatric patient populations.
We measured plasma efavirenz concentrations in 15 children during and after rifampicin-based antitubercular treatment. They were receiving standard doses of efavirenz as part of antiretroviral treatment. Trough concentration (Cmin) was estimated by extrapolation of the log-linear concentration-time line to 24 hours after the previous dose.
Wide interpatient variation and marked bimodality of efavirenz concentrations were observed. Efavirenz Cmin was not significantly different during vs. after antitubercular treatment (median 0.83 mg/L interquartile range 0.59-6.57 vs. median 0.86 mg/L interquartile range 0.61-3.56; P = 0.125). Nine (60%) and 8 (53%) children had subtherapeutic Cmin (<1 mg/L) during and after antitubercular treatment, respectively.

20477282,Cytokine therapy of tuberculosis at the crossroads.,,Expert review of respiratory medicine,"Drug treatment is the key strategy in TB control. However, the treatment course lasts 6-9 months because the current anti-TB drugs are poorly effective against nondividing (i.e., persistent) bacilli. As a result, completion rates are unsatisfactory, leading to emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infection. It would, therefore, be very desirable to design a form of complementary treatment that could speed up the recovery process for people afflicted with TB and reduce the relapse rates. With the advancement of our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of TB, it has become increasingly possible to develop novel adjunctive immunotherapies for both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB. Notably, cytokines probably offer the most promising prospect of such a therapy being introduced in routine clinical practice. However, in many ways, the cytokine therapy of TB has reached a crossroad, since, although the initial promise failed to live up to expectations, sufficient encouraging evidence exists to warrant further exploration. There are clear arguments in favor as well as against such treatments. This review aims to provide a rationale for cytokine treatment of TB, to describe the current status of several cytokines that have been considered for that purpose and, ultimately, to make a case for the need for further clinical trials.",,,,2009-02-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
20443872,The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: a global health crisis requiring new interventions: Part II: scientific advances that may provide solutions.,,Clinical and translational science,"The need for new tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics has never been greater as TB in the HIV-infected is often sputum smear negative or extrapulmonary and may progress rapidly unless diagnosed and treated appropriately. In addition, the empirical treatment of patients with drug-resistant TB leads to the acquisition of additional resistance. Fortunately there is a robust and adequately funded developments pipeline including investigational rapid diagnostics that may replace smear, culture, and drug susceptibility testing. The dogma that drug resistance usually develops as a consequence of patient nonadherence has never been entirely plausible. Recent observations indicate that certain mutations in drug resistance genes promote the acquisition of additional resistance. Further, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) may demonstrate tolerant phenotypes due to induction of a multidrug-resistant like pump. It will be difficult to ""treat our way"" out of the problem of extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB without access to new interventions. Vaccines in development offer a distant hope.

19160285,Impact of tuberculosis preventive therapy on tuberculosis and mortality in HIV-infected children.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Children with HIV are at increased risk of acquiring tuberculosis (TB), a common cause of acute and chronic respiratory disease and death in HIV-infected children living in areas where prevalence of the disease is high. Children infected with HIV and TB have worse outcomes than HIV-uninfected children who have TB; thus, preventing the infection and disease in HIV-infected children is potentially an important public health intervention. Isoniazid, an anti-tuberculosis medication, has been used effectively to prevent TB in HIV-uninfected children, but currently there are no guidelines on the use of TB preventive therapy in HIV-infected children.
To determine the impact of TB preventive therapy on TB-related incidence and death in HIV-infected children
We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR), Cochrane HIV/AIDS Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and AIDSearch. In addition, we scanned reference lists, manually searched conference abstracts, and contacted content experts.
We included studies of HIV-infected children randomised to receive TB preventive therapy or placebo, or an alternative TB preventive regimen. Participants could have tuberculin skin test results that were positive or negative.
Two authors independently used the study selection criteria, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Effects were assessed using hazard ratios.
One trial met the selection criteria for the review. The trial participants were HIV-infected children, most of whom were not taking antiretroviral therapy. Subjects were randomised to isoniazid and cotrimoxazole or placebo and cotrimoxazole, given daily or three times a week. The trial showed a marked reduction in TB incidence and death in the isoniazid group. As yet, however, there are no long-term follow-up data on the durability of the protective effect or on possible long-term adverse events. This trial also was unable to assess the impact of isoniazid prophylaxis on children receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Isoniazid prophylaxis in HIV-infected children has the potential to play a major public health role by reducing TB incidence and death. As yet, however, data are insufficient to guide the duration of prophylaxis and to support its use in children using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and in those living in areas of low TB prevalence. Further studies are needed to assess whether TB preventive therapy is of benefit in all HIV-infected children, irrespective of use of antiretroviral treatment, the optimal duration of preventive therapy, or long-term adverse events.",,,,2009-01-23,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

19152149,Vaccine strategies against tuberculosis.,,Swiss medical weekly,"The need for an improved vaccine against tuberculosis has never been more urgent. The HIV epidemic and the emergence of multi and extensively drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis mean that global control of this pathogen remains inadequate. The existing vaccine, BCG, confers only variable protection against pulmonary disease. Exposure to environmental mycobacteria may contribute to this variability in protective efficacy. Protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis is dependant on a cell-mediated immune response. Boosting BCG with a subunit vaccine, and/or replacing BCG with an improved BCG are both strategies currently being investigated. Since 2002, there have been increasing numbers of TB vaccine candidates entering into clinical trials. The first of these candidates, MVA85A, is safe and highly immunogenic in all trials to date. In addition, the cellular immune response induced is highly polyfunctional.

19146741,What has Karonga taught us? Tuberculosis studied over three decades.,,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"This paper summarises tuberculosis (TB) research over almost 30 years in Karonga District, northern Malawi, an area typical of much of rural Africa. The dominant factor has been the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which arrived in the district about 1980, leading to an increase in TB incidence to a peak of approximately 65 smear-positive pulmonary cases per 100000 population in 2000. Tuberculin surveys indicate annual risks of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of approximately 1%; thus, most of the population is uninfected and at risk of primary infection and disease. Molecular epidemiological studies demonstrate that about two thirds of TB arises from recent infection, but recognisable recent contact is responsible for only about 10% of disease. By 2001, 57% of TB was directly attributable to HIV, implying that it would have declined were it not for HIV. HIV infection increases the risk of TB most among young adults, and greatly increases the risk of recurrence from new infection after treatment. Mortality rates in the HIV-infected are high, but there is no association of HIV with drug resistance. Other risk factors with relatively smaller effects include age and sex, contact, several genetic polymorphisms and area. Neither one nor two doses of the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against adult pulmonary TB, despite protecting against leprosy. Skin test surveys, cohort studies and comparative immunological studies with the UK suggest that exposure to environmental mycobacteria provides some protection against TB and that BCG's failure is attributable partly to this widespread heterologous exposure masking effects of the vaccine. Drug resistance has remained constant (<10%) over more than 20 years. Immunotherapy with M. vaccae provided no benefits, but treatment of HIV-positive patients with cotrimoxazole reduced mortality. The Karonga programme illustrates the value of long-term population-based studies to investigate the natural history of TB and to influence TB control policy. Current studies focus on immunological markers of infection, disease and protection, and on elucidating the impact of antiretroviral treatment on TB incidence at population level.",,,,2009-01-17,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The long courses of therapy required, together with significant medication side-effects and resulting difficulties with adherence to therapy all contribute to increasing problems with emerging drug resistance. There is thus an urgent need for new antituberculous drug development, especially to enable effective shorter course therapy for drug-susceptible and resistant TB, to find effective drugs for treatment of drug-resistant TB, to shorten therapy for latent TB infection and to reduce drug interactions in combination with antiretroviral therapy, a major issue in the treatment of HIV co-infected patients.

Nevertheless, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), for which chemotherapy is ineffective, has again made cytokine-based therapy attractive as one of the last available options. The results of clinical trials treating pulmonary tuberculosis with cytokines have not been encouraging, making it clear that therapeutic strategies utilizing a single cytokine are inadequate. To develop effective cytokine-based XDR TB therapies, more basic research will be needed to achieve a better understanding of how cytokines promote a successful immune response. We not only have to investigate cytokines already known to participate in tuberculosis, but also the role of other cytokines and chemokines that may enhance both the mycobacterial killing activity of effector cells and the restriction of bacterial intracellular multiplication. There are already several patents involving cytokines for therapeutic use, in the hope of stimulating the immune system in a variety of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis.

Demonstration of clinical efficacy in drug-sensitive tuberculosis is challenging, given high success rates for existing regimens, concerns about substituting an investigational agent for the most effective agents in a regimen and difficulties in determining the effect size of the components of a combination regimen. Large and prolonged studies would be needed either to show superiority over existing regimens or statistically defensible non-inferiority compared to existing regimens. In contrast, exploring efficacy of novel treatments in the setting of drug-resistant disease may present certain opportunities. In drug-resistant disease, the efficacy of existing regimens is comparatively poor, and companion drugs used to treat drug-resistant disease are weak or ineffective, enabling demonstration of the effect of the new drug. Other advantages of this approach, which has been used successfully in the development of antiretroviral agents, include the possibility of demonstrating drug efficacy using smaller studies, the possibility of accelerated approval based on a surrogate endpoint and the opportunity to address an urgent public health need.

In three patients resistant to treatment, methotrexate was added at a 15-25 mg dose weekly after the sixth week of infliximab therapy. Pretreatment evaluations included chest X-ray, tuberculin test (5 units), full blood count, kidney and liver function tests, antinuclear antibodies and patient weight. Response to treatment, using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, and adverse effects were prospectively assessed at weeks 0, 6 and 22. At week 6, after only two infusions, 78.9% (15/19) of patients showed at least 75% improvement in baseline PASI (PASI 75). At week 22, 73.6% (14/19) patients had reached PASI 75. Three patients had a relapse. Four developed adverse effects that required suspension of infliximab therapy. No tuberculosis or lymphoproliferative disease was observed. Four patients (21%) showed apparition of positive antinuclear antibody during the course of treatment and 57.8% (11/19) of patients showed an increase in weight at week 22. Our experience shows that infliximab is a very rapidly effective treatment of severe, treatment-resistant psoriasis as soon as the sixth week of treatment.",,,,2008-10-08,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The current drug regimen is 40 years old and takes 6-9 months to administer. In addition, the emergence of drug resistant strains and HIV co-infection mean that there is an urgent need for new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The twenty-first century has seen a revival in research and development activity in this area, with several new drug candidates entering clinical trials. This review considers new potential first-line anti-tuberculosis drug candidates, in particular those with novel mechanisms of action, as these are most likely to prove effective against resistant strains. A brief overview of current first-line and recent drugs (such as fluoroquinolones, rifampicin and isoniazid analogues) is initially presented.

Conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods are slow and demanding. Alternative, rapid DST methods would permit the early detection of drug resistance and, in turn, arrest tuberculosis transmission.
A cost-effectiveness analysis of 5 DST methods was performed in the context of a clinical trial that compared rapid with conventional DST methods. The methods under investigation were direct phage-replication assay (FASTPlaque-Response; Biotech), direct amplification and reverse hybridization of the rpoB gene (INNO-LiPA; Innogenetics), indirect colorimetric minimum inhibitory concentration assay (MTT; ICN Biomedicals), and direct proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen medium. These were compared with the widely used indirect proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen medium.
All alternative DST methods were found to be cost-effective, compared with other health care interventions. DST methods also generate substantial cost savings in settings of high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Excluding the effects of transmission, the direct proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen medium was the most cost-effective alternative DST method for patient groups with prevalences of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis of 2%, 5%, 20%, and 50% (cost in US$2004, $94, $36, $8, and $2 per disability-adjusted life year, respectively).

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of initial drug resistance and treatment regimen on tuberculosis treatment outcomes.
PubMed, the Cochrane Central Database of Clinical Trials, and EMBASE were searched for studies published in English from 1965 to June 2007. Additional studies were identified from cited references.
Randomized, controlled trials and cohort studies of standardized treatment of previously untreated patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Drug-susceptibility testing was done on pretreatment isolates from all patients and from patients with treatment failure or relapse.
Two authors reviewed the studies for methods, initial drug resistance, treatment regimens, and outcomes.
Pooled cumulative incidences were computed with random-effects meta-analyses. Association between risk factors and outcomes were determined by using stratified analyses. The cumulative incidence of acquired drug resistance with initially pan-sensitive strains was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5% to 1.0%) compared with 6% (CI, 4% to 8%) with initially single drug-resistant strains and 14% (CI, 9% to 20%) with initially polydrug-resistant strains. Failure and relapse were most strongly associated with initial drug resistance. Failure was also associated with shorter duration of rifampin therapy and nonuse of streptomycin, whereas the rate of relapse was higher with shorter duration of rifampin therapy and nonuse of pyrazinamide.

Quinoxaline-2-carboxylate 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives were tested in vitro against a broad panel of single-drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. The susceptibilities of these strains to some compounds were comparable to those of strain H(37)Rv, as indicated by the ratios of MICs for resistant and nonresistant strains, supporting the premise that 1,4-di-N-oxide quinoxaline derivatives have a novel mode of action unrelated to those of the currently used antitubercular drugs. Specific derivatives were further evaluated in a series of in vivo assays, including evaluations of the maximum tolerated doses, the levels of oral bioavailability, and the efficacies in a low-dose aerosol model of tuberculosis in mice. One compound, ethyl 7-chloro-3-methylquinoxaline-2-carboxylate 1,4-dioxide, was found to be (i) active in reducing CFU counts in both the lungs and spleens of infected mice following oral administration, (ii) active against PA-824-resistant Mycobacterium bovis, indicating that the pathway of bioreduction/activation is different from that of PA-824 (a bioreduced nitroimidazole that is in clinical trials), and (iii) very active against nonreplicating bacteria adapted to low-oxygen conditions.

Different vaccine strategies will probably be required for the various needs that exist within a population in which some individuals have been previously immunized with BCG, coinfected with HIV and/or latently infected with M. tuberculosis. In the last 15 years, new strategies to improve or replace BCG in the laboratory have led to several promising vaccine candidates that are actively being evaluated in human clinical trials.

TMC207 exhibits high in vitro activity against mycobacterial strains either susceptible or resistant to all first-line and many second-line drugs, including fluoroquinolones, and has shown exceptional in vivo activity against several mycobacterial species in different animal models. In this early bactericidal activity study, 75 treatment-naïve patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were randomized to once-daily oral TMC207 (25 mg, 100 mg, or 400 mg), 600 mg rifampin (RIF), or 300 mg isoniazid (INH) for 7 days. Sixteen-hour overnight sputum collected at baseline and on each treatment day was plated in serial dilutions on selective agar plates. The bactericidal activity was expressed as the log(10) decrease in CFU/ml sputum/day. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed on day 7 of TMC207 administration up to 24 h postdose. The decreases in log(10) CFU counts (+/- standard deviation) from baseline to day 7 were 0.04 +/- 0.46 for 25 mg TMC207 (n = 14), 0.26 +/- 0.64 for 100 mg TMC207 (n = 14), 0.77 +/- 0.58 for 400 mg TMC207 (n = 14), 1.88 +/- 0.74 for INH (n = 11), and 1.70 +/- 0.71 for RIF (n = 14). Significant bactericidal activity of 400 mg TMC207 was observed from day 4 onward and was similar in magnitude to those of INH and RIF over the same period.

Quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxides represent a new class of orally active antitubercular drugs. They are likely bioreduced to an active metabolite, but the pathway of bacterial activation was different from PA-824, a bioreducible nitroimidazole in clinical trials. Compound 5 was bactericidal and active on NRP organisms indicating that activation occurred in both growing and non-replicating bacteria leading to cell death. The presence of NRP bacteria is believed to be a major factor responsible for the prolonged nature of antitubercular therapy.

A test which could predict patients at risk of a delayed response to treatment would facilitate clinical trials of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. A widely-used test for the assessment of response to treatment is sputum smear examination. Patients who are smear positive after 2 and 3 months of treatment are said to have delayed and significantly delayed treatment responses respectively. Time to positivity (TTP) values of Bactec cultures, from the first 2 weeks of treatment were used to predict delayed and significantly delayed treatment responses in patients with first time pulmonary tuberculosis. Changes in TTP values early in treatment were transformed to a response ratio (r). Values of r that were less than a threshold value (r(c)) indicated patients who were at risk of having delayed or significantly delayed response to treatment. Accuracy of prediction was sensitive to the timing of sputum sampling and adherence to therapy in the first 2 weeks. Based on TTP data from the first 2 weeks of treatment, significantly delayed treatment response could be predicted with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 62% while the positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were 14% and 97% respectively. While the high NPV indicates that a large proportion of patients with a satisfactory response to treatment can be reliably identified, the low PPV value underlines the need to use TTP in conjunction with other markers of disease activity to predict unfavourable treatment response in tuberculosis treatment.",,,,2008-05-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The aim of the present paper is to discuss the appropriate management of rhinologic and laryngeal conditions that may be encountered during pregnancy. A literature review from Medline and database sources was carried out. Related books and written guidelines were also included. Controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective studies, case-control studies, laboratory studies, clinical and systematic reviews, metanalyses, and case reports were analysed. The following drugs are considered relatively safe: beta-lactam antibiotics (with dose adjustment), macrolides (although the use of erythromycin and clarithromycin carries a certain risk), clindamycin, metronidazole (better avoided in the first trimester), amphotericin-B (especially in immunocompromised situations during the second and third trimester) and acyclovir. First-line antituberculous agents isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and ciprofloxacine in drug-resistant tuberculosis can be also used. Non-selective NSAIDs (until the 32nd week), nasal decongestants (with caution and up to 7 days), intranasal corticosteroids, with budesonide as the treatment of choice, second generation antihistamines (cetirizine in the third trimester, or loratadine in the second and third trimester), H2 receptor antagonists (except nizatidine) and proton pump inhibitors (except omeprazole) can be used to relieve patients from the related symptoms. In cases of emergencies, epinephrine, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dimetindene and nebulised b(2) agonists can be used with extreme caution. By contrast, selective COX-2 inhibitors and BCG vaccination are contraindicated in pregnancy. When prescribing to a pregnant woman, the safety of the materno-foetal unit is considered paramount.

We also scanned reference lists of all identified studies and contacted researchers.
Randomized controlled trials of antituberculous regimens containing fluoroquinolones in people diagnosed with bacteriologically positive (sputum smear or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis.
Two authors independently applied inclusion criteria, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We used relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data (both with 95% confidence intervals (CI)), and the random-effects model if we detected heterogeneity and it was appropriate to combine data.
Eleven trials (1514 participants) met the inclusion criteria. No statistically significant difference was found in trials substituting ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or moxifloxacin for first-line drugs in relation to cure (416 participants, 3 trials), treatment failure (388 participants, 3 trials), or clinical or radiological improvement (216 participants, 2 trials). Substituting ciprofloxacin into first-line regimens in drug-sensitive tuberculosis led to a higher incidence of relapse (RR 7.17, 95% CI 1.33 to 38.58; 384 participants, 3 trials) and longer time to sputum culture conversion (WMD 0.50 months, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 168 participants, 1 trial), although this was confined to HIV-positive participants. Substituting for ethambutol in first-line regimens led to a higher incidence of total number of adverse events (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.72; 492 participants, 2 trials). Adding or substituting levofloxacin to basic regimens in drug-resistant areas had no effect.

18018602,[Recent progress in mycobacteriology].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most successful bacterial parasites of humans, infecting over one-third of the population of the world as latent infection without clinical manifestations. Over 8.8 million new cases and nearly 2 million deaths by tuberculosis (TB) occur annually. TB poses a significant health threat to the world population. The goal of this symposium is to open new avenues for combating tuberculosis. The speakers have presented their data and provided control strategies against tuberculosis and pulmonary disease due to M. avium complex (MAC) from aspects of molecular epidemiology, pathogenesis, serodiagnosis, new anti-TB drugs, and vaccine development. Drs. Maeda and Murase have reported that the 12-locus VNTR analysis is very useful for molecular epidemiology of M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Japan better than IS6110-RFLP and suggested that the analysis is powerful tool for the molecular epidemiology. Drs. Matsumoto and Kobayashi have discovered a protein, mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDPl), overproduced in dormant M. tuberculosis that plays key roles in latent/ persistent infection, disease progression, and host protection. They have concluded that MDP1 may be a possible target for anti-tuberculosis drugs and vaccines. Drs. Kitada and Maekura have developed serodiagnosis of MAC disease based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) by detecting anti-glycopeptidolipid (GPL) antibody in sera of human patients. GPL is specific for MAC. The EIA is a simple, rapid and accurate measure with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of antibody also reflect disease activity. A large-scale clinical multicenter study is currently in progress. Dr. Makoto Matsumoto has discovered an innovative new anti-TB drug, OPC-67683 that is a derivative of nitroimidazole compounds. OPC-67683 inhibited mycolic acid synthesis and exerted potent antimycobacterial activity, including multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Multidrug therapy using OPC-67683 could also shorten the course of chemotherapy. The drug is clearly the most promising new anti-TB agent that has been identified in many years. Dr. Okada has presented the vaccine candidates for TB, such as HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA and HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA. The candidates exhibited an excellent protective efficacy in mice compared to current BCG vaccine, and improved histopathologic lesions induced by M. tuberculosis infection. The candidates also exerted the therapeutic effect in mice against both drugsusceptible TB and extensively drug-resistant TB. Using the cynomolgus monkey model (similar to human TB), HVJ-liposome/ HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA provided higher protective efficacy than BCG assessed by mortality. The combination of BCG and HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA by the prime-booster procedure could lead to a synergistic effect of 100% survival in infected monkeys. These data suggest that the novel DNA vaccine is a possible candidate for human clinical trials. This symposium has highlighted new advances in our understanding of molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of ""Mycobacteriology"" and development of new serodiagnostics, anti-TB drugs, and vaccines. 1. The establishment of the quick genotyping method for TB in Japan using the variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR): Shinji MAEDA, Yoshiro MURASE (Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) The 12-locus VNTR analysis that we have established optimally for Mycobacteriun tuberculosis in Japan was superior to the proposed 15-locus VNTR method in European countries. The discriminatory power of our system was also higher than that of IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In future, we will investigate the stability of copy number in each locus by using the strains that suspected epidemiological links in contact investigations. 2. A virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which contributes to persistent infection, reactivation, and host protection: Sohkichi MATSUMOTO (Department of Host Defense, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine), Kazuo KOBAYASHI (Department of Immunology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases) Majority of adult tuberculosis is caused by reactivation of previously implanted Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During latent infection, some bacilli are in dormant state, which confers some survival advantage to not only bacteria but also the host. We presented that a protein overproduced in dormant M. tuberculosis plays key roles in persistent infection, disease progression, and host protection. We also presented utility of this protein, such as development of anti-tuberculosis drug and vaccine. 3. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease by enzyme immunoassay using glycopeptidolipid antigen: Seigo KITADA, Ryoji MAEKURA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization National Toneyama Hospital) The diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) and/or its discrimination from pulmonary tuberculosis is sometimes complicated and time consuming. We have developed serological test by enzyme immunoassay that detect serum antibody to glycopeptidolipid antigen. The serodiagnosis is useful for the rapid diagnosis of MAC-PD and differential diagnosis from pulmonary TB. The antibody levels reflected the disease activity including radiographic severity. 4. A novel antituberculous agent, OPC-67683: Research and development: Makoto MATSUMOTO (Microbiological Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) We initiated a program to screen new antituberculous agents that have potential to shorten the total duration of treatment, provide improved efficacy against MDR-TB, be useful in treating HIV co-infected patients, and target latent TB infections. Our efforts led to the discovery of OPC-67683, a novel oxazo-imidazole derivative with a distinctive characteristic as a subclass mycolic acid inhibitor. Our evaluation studies confirmed OPC-67683 to possess potent in vitro and in vivo antituberculous activity, suggesting potential usefulness in alleviating the current TB problems. 5. The development of novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis: Masaji OKADA (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center) We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (HVJ-liposome/ or HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+ IL-12 DNA). The vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to BCG vaccine, and improved the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also exerted therapeutic effect in vivo against XDR-TB as well as drug-sensitive TB in mice. Furthermore, by using the cynomolgus monkey (similar to human tuberculosis), this novel vaccine provided higher protective efficacy (mortality) than BCG mortality. Furthermore, the combination of HSP65+IL-12/HVJ and BCG by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100% survival). These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against TB for human clinical trials.",,,,2007-11-21,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

It is anticipated that early identification of MDR-TB and appropriate treatment will improve patient outcome and disease control. We evaluated the rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in previously treated TB patients, directly from acidfast bacilli (AFB)-positive sputum using a phage-based test, FASTPlaque-Response (Biotec Laboratories Ltd, Ipswich, UK). The ability of rifampicin resistance to predict MDR-TB was also determined.
A prospective study was done comparing performance of the rapid phage test with conventional culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) in AFB-positive TB patients.
Five primary health clinics and one TB referral centre in the Port Elizabeth Metropolitan area, Eastern Cape.
Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of the phage test were determined compared with gold standard culture and DST. Discrepant results were resolved by molecular detection of mutations conferring rifampicin resistance. The proportion of rifampicin-resistant strains that were MDR was also determined.
Previously treated patients were at a high risk of MDRTB (35.7%). Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of FASTPlaque-Response for rifampicin resistance determination were 95.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 91.0 - 99.8%), 97.2% (95% CI: 94.5 - 99.9%) and 96.5% (95% CI: 94.1 - 98.9%) respectively compared with conventional DST (unresolved), calculated for specimens that had both FASTPlaque-Response and conventional DST results available. FASTPlaque-Response results were available in 2 days instead of 28 - 85 days with conventional DST. However, only 70.6% of FASTPlaque-Response results were interpretable compared with 86.3% of conventional DST results. The majority (95.5%) of rifampicinresistant strains were MDR-TB.
Rapid detection of rifampicin resistance using FASTPlaque-Response could contribute to improved management of patients at risk of MDR-TB, such as previously treated patients. However, improvement in control of specimen-related contamination is needed to ensure that a higher proportion of FASTPlaque-Response results are interpretable.

17970222,Challenges associated with current and future TB treatment.,,Infectious disorders drug targets,"Current tuberculosis (TB) treatment is based on a combination of drugs that were developed mostly in the central decades of the last century. Cure rates are high for drug sensitive strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) when the recommended complex and lengthy treatment protocols are adhered to. However the difficulty in correctly prescribing and adhering to these protocols, the emergence of M tb strains resistant to multiple drugs, and drug-drug interactions that interfere with optimal treatment of HIV and TB coinfected patients have generated a pressing need for improved TB therapies. Together with the ominous global burden of TB, these shortcomings of current treatment have contributed to a renewed interest in the development of improved drugs and protocols for the treatment of tuberculosis. This article highlights hurdles related to the optimized use of existing drugs and challenges related to the development of novel, improved products, focusing in particular on aspects inherent in TB drug clinical development.

17970220,"The evolution of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB): history, status and issues for global control.",,Infectious disorders drug targets,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a devastating disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that killed an estimated 4000-5000 person each day during 2005. Although infections with drug sensitive strains can be effectively cured with a 6 to 9 month regimen of multiple antibiotics, the inability to deliver and complete appropriate courses of therapy on a global level has led to the selection of resistant strains over the past 50 years. The selection and spread of multiple drug resistant M. tuberculosis continued for decades leading to two operationally distinct forms of the disease, multiple drug resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant (XDR-TB). The estimate for MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases for 2005 were 424,000 and 27,000 respectively, and the situation is worst in areas with high incidences of HIV infection. The outcome was predictable based on basic microbiological principles, and the resultant and future epidemic effectively modeled mathematically. This situation was brought to the forefront when an outbreak of XDR-TB occurred in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005 and began to spread. Unfortunately, we do not know the true extent of XDR-TB globally. However, all signs point to an emerging epidemic of TB infections that will be difficult, if not impossible to cure. A few new drugs are in clinical trials, but it is too early to know the final outcome; some may fail, and none will be available for several years.

In HIV(+) patients and immigrants from areas with a rate of primary resistance to isoniazid > 4%, ethambutol should be added until susceptibility studies are available. Second phase (continuation phase): rifampin and isoniazid, given daily or intermittently for 4 months in the general population. HIV(+) patients (< or = 200 CD4) and culture-positive patients after 2 months of treatment should receive a 7-month continuation phase. A 6-month regimen is recommended for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, with the exception of tuberculous meningitis, which should be treated for a minimum of 12 months and bone/joint tuberculosis, treated for a minimum of 9 months. Treatment regimens for multidrug resistant tuberculosis are based on expert opinion.

17883288,Fluoroquinolones for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.,,Drugs,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a significant problem globally. Treatment includes a multiple drug regimen with isoniazid, rifampicin (rifampin), pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Often, one of these medications needs to be replaced as a result of adverse events or because Mycobacterium tuberculosis develops resistance against one these first-line agents. Fluoroquinolones, particularly the newer ones, possess good in vitro (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin) and in vivo (gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin) bactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis, making them attractive agents for the treatment of pulmonary TB. All relevant clinical trials, cohort studies and case reports investigating the clinical efficacy and tolerability of fluoroquinolones when used for the treatment of pulmonary TB were evaluated for this review. Specifically, efficacy and safety in the following indications were investigated: (i) first-line treatment of drug-sensitive pulmonary TB; (ii) first-line treatment for multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB; and (iii) treatment of patients with drug intolerance. Twenty-seven articles met our inclusion criteria; nine articles presented data from randomised, controlled or cohort studies. Seven studies used fluoroquinolones as first-line agents in drug-sensitive TB (1469 patients), 15 studies used fluoroquinolones to treat MDR-TB (1025 patients) and six studies (951 patients) investigated the use of fluoroquinolones in patients intolerant to other TB medications. In patients with susceptible M. tuberculosis strains, substitution with a fluoroquinolone did not have an effect on cure or radiological improvement at 8 weeks or failure at 12 months. Substitution of older fluoroquinolones into a regimen, especially ciprofloxacin, resulted in a higher rate of relapse and a longer time to sputum-culture conversions. The use of fluoroquinolones in patients with MDR-TB is supported by some trials where others show a lack of improvement in efficacy of a regimen. Our review of the literature does not support the use of older fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, as substitute agents for drug-sensitive or drug-resistant TB. However, newer fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin, may be a reasonable alternative based on results from one large clinical trial. Fluoroquinolones have an important role as substitute agents for those who are intolerant of first-line TB agents.",,,,2007-09-22,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We reanalyzed three reports regarding the relationship between in vitro susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the clinical outcome of in-patients treated with these drugs at the Muñiz Hospital, Buenos Aires, during the sixties. These patients had been irregularly treated with a standard regimen consisting of isoniazid, streptomycin and PAS; they developed resistance to at least the first two drugs and persisted culture-positive. Susceptibility testing to ethionamide, cycloserine and kanamycin were performed by the proportion method on Löwenstein Jensen medium. Some level of resistance was detected among isolates from patients not previously treated with these drugs, that could be due to cross resistance with previously administered first line structural analogs. However, the studies evidenced significant association between resistance to ethionamide and cycloserine and prior treatment with these drugs. Increased resistance to all three drugs was detected within the first three months of treatment. In vitro resistance to ethionamide emerged earlier and was the most frequent followed by resistance to cycloserine and kanamycin. The low frequency of resistance to kanamycin could be related to the low dosage of this drug used at that time. Simultaneous resistance to the three agents, but not to two or one drug, appeared to be a marker of treatment failure. An apparent reversion of drug resistance was observed in near 6% of patients, for whom susceptibility tests were repeated on subsequent isolates, indicating this percentage of inconsistency in reproducibility of test results.",,,,2007-07-17,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Outbreaks of healthcare-associated tuberculosis are usually associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment, or the care of patients in sub-optimal facilities. The control and prevention of tuberculosis in hospitals is best achieved by three approaches, namely administrative (early investigation diagnosis, etc.), engineering (physical facilities e.g. ventilated isolation rooms) and personal respiratory protection (face sealing masks which are filtered). Recent guidelines on the prevention of tuberculosis in healthcare facilities from Europe and the USA have many common themes. In the UK, however, negative pressure isolation rooms are recommended only for patients with suspected multi-drug resistant TB and personal respiratory protection, i.e. filtered masks, are not considered necessary unless multi-drug resistant TB is suspected, or where aerosol-generating procedures are likely. In the US, the standard of care for patients with infectious tuberculosis is a negative pressure ventilated room and the use of personal respiratory protection for all healthcare workers entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. The absence of clinical trials in this area precludes dogmatic recommendations. Nonetheless, observational studies and mathematical modelling suggest that all measures are required for effective prevention. Even when policies and facilities are optimal, there is a need to regularly review and audit these as sometimes compliance is less than optimal. The differences in recommendations may reflect the variations in epidemiology and the greater use of BCG vaccination in the UK compared with the United States. There is a strong argument for advising ventilated facilities and personal respiratory protection for the care of all patients with tuberculosis, as multi-drug tuberculosis may not always be apparent on admission, and these measures minimise transmission of all cases of TB to other patients and healthcare staff.",,,,2007-03-14,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Body weight remained stable or slightly decreased in all subjects during the study period, and none displayed radiographic improvement on serial chest computed tomography scanning. Sputum smears and cultures remained positive for all patients, and there was no increase in the mean time to yield a positive culture (from 16.5+/-6.4 to 11.8+/-4.9 days). There was no enhancement of cell-mediated immune responses in terms of production of IFN-gamma or IL-10, or of composition of lymphocytes among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In four patients, therapy was discontinued because of adverse reactions.

17291770,Antituberculosis drugs: ten years of research.,,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Tuberculosis is today amongst the worldwide health threats. As resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have slowly emerged, treatment failure is too often a fact, especially in countries lacking the necessary health care organisation to provide the long and costly treatment adapted to patients. Because of lack of treatment or lack of adapted treatment, at least two million people will die of tuberculosis this year. Due to this concern, this infectious disease was the focus of renewed scientific interest in the last decade. Regimens were optimized and much was learnt on the mechanisms of action of the antituberculosis drugs used. Moreover, the quest for original drugs overcoming some of the problems of current regimens also became the focus of research programmes and many new series of M. tuberculosis growth inhibitors were reported. This review presents the drugs currently used in antituberculosis treatments and the most advanced compounds undergoing clinical trials. We then provide a description of their mechanism of action along with other series of inhibitors known to act on related biochemical targets. This is followed by other inhibitors of M. tuberculosis growth, including recently reported compounds devoid of a reported mechanism of action.",,,,2007-02-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
17240921,[Development of antituberculous drugs: current status and future prospects].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) remains the most frequent and important infectious disease causing morbidity and death. One-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the etiologic agent of TB. The World Health Organization estimates that about eight to ten million new TB cases occur annually worldwide and the incidence of TB is currently increasing. In this context, TB is in the top three, with malaria and HIV being the leading causes of death from a single infectious agent, and approximately two million deaths are attributable to TB annually. In particular, pulmonary TB, the most common form of TB, is a highly contagious and life-threatening infection. Moreover, enhanced susceptibility to TB in HIV-infected populations is another serious health problem throughout the world. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has been increasing in incidence in many areas, not only in developing countries but industrialized countries as well, during the past decade. These situations, particularly the global resurgence of TB and the rapid emergence of MDR-TB, underscore the importance of the development of new antituberculous drugs and new protocols for efficacious clinical control of TB patients using ordinary antimycobacterial drugs. Concerning the development of new antituberculous drugs, the following points are of particular importance. (1) Development of drugs which display lasting antimycobacterial activity in vivo is desirable, since they can be administered with long intervals and consequently facilitate directly observed therapy and enhance patient compliance. (2) Development of novel antituberculosis compounds to combat MDR-TB is urgently needed. (3) The eradication of slowly metabolizing and, if possible, dormant populations of MTB organisms that cause relapse, using new classes of anti-TB drugs is very promising for prevention of TB incidence, because it will markedly reduce the incidence of active TB from persons who are latently infected with MTB. Unfortunately, no new drugs except rifabutin and rifapentine has been marketed for TB in the US and other countries during the 40 years after release of rifampicin. There are a number of constraints that have deterred companies from investing in new anti-TB drugs. The research is expensive, slow and difficult, and requires specialized facilities for handling MTB. There are few animal models that closely mimic the human TB disease. Development time of any anti-TB drug will be long. In fact, clinical trials will require the minimum six-month therapy, with a follow-up period of one year or more. In addition, it is hard to demonstrate obvious benefit of a new anti-TB agents over pre-existing drugs, since clinical trials involve multidrug combination therapy using highly effective ordinary anti-TB drugs. Finaly, there is the perceived lack of commercial return to companies engaged in the development of new anti-TB drugs, because over 95% of TB cases worldwide are in developing countries. In this symposium, we reviewed the following areas. 1. Critical new information on the entire genome of MTB recently obtained and increasing knowledge of various mycobacterial virulence genes are greatly promoting the identification of genes that code for new drug targets. In this context, Dr. Namba reviewed the status of new types of compounds which are being developed as anti-TB drug. He also discussed the development of new antimycobacterial drugs according to new and potential pharmacological targets and the best clinical development plans for new-TB drugs in relation to corporate strategy. 2. Using such findings for mycobacterial genomes, bioinformatics/genomics/proteomics-based drug design and drug development using quantitative structure-activity relationships may be possible in the near future. In this context, Dr. Suwa and Dr. Suzuki reviewed the usefulness of chemical genomics in searching novel drug targets for development of new antituberculous drugs. The authors reviewed (1) the history and present status of chemical genomics that is defined as the systemic search for a selective small molecular modulator for each function of all gene products, (2) recent studies of the authors on profiles of the interactions between various kinds of human proteins and small molecule modulators using the new technology devised by Reverse Proteomics Research Institute, and (3) future prospects of the development of new antituberculous drugs based on chemical genomics. 3. It appears also promising to develop new types of drug administration systems using drug vehicles, which enable efficacious drug delivery to their target in vivo. Dr. Izumikawa, Dr. Ohno and Dr. Kohno reviewed the usefulness of liposome- and polymer-based technologies, which enable efficacious delivery of encapsulated drugs at required doses for prolonged periods of time with only a single shot without toxicity, and also enable highly targeted delivery of drugs to their target in vivo. They indicated that the applications of drug delivery system using conventional anti-mycobacterial agents are challenging to improve the compliance of treatment and better clinical outcome. 4. Immunoadjunctive therapy appears to be promising in improving outcome of clinical control of refractory mycobacterial infections, including MDR-TB and M. avium complex infection. Dr. Shimizu, Dr. Sato and Dr. Tomioka reviewed the present status of immunotherapy of mycobacterial infections in combination with antimycobacterial drugs. They indicated that the development of new classes of immunomodulators other than cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, IL-12, etc.) particularly those with no severe side-effects, are urgently needed. Their review dealed with some promising immunoadjunctive agents, especially ATP and its analogues, which potentiate macrophage antimycobacterial activity via purinergic P2 receptors. The aim of this symposium is to address the future prospects of the development of new drugs and drug regimens for anti-TB chemotherapy. There are a number of difficulties in drug-design for the development of new drug formulations with increased potential for antimycobacterial effects, excellent pharmacokinetics, and tolerability. It should be emphasized that the most urgent goal of chemotherapy of TB and MAC infections, especially that associated with HIV infection, is to develop highly active, low-cost drugs which can be used not only in industrialized countries but also in developing countries, since the incidences of AIDS-associated intractable TB and MAC infections are rapidly increasing in the latter. We strongly wish a great advance of fundametal and practical studies in developing such kinds of new anti-TB drugs in the near future. 1. Prospects for non-clinical or clinical development of new antituberculous drugs in relation to corporate strategy: Kenji NAMBA (New Product Research Laboratories I, Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest threats to public health. No new anti-TB drugs have been brought into the clinic in the past 40 years. Current non-clinical works with progressed technology and Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, a non-profit organization established in 2000, accelerate research and development of faster-acting anti-TB compounds. We reviewed the status of new types of compounds which are being developed as anti-TB drug, such as diarylquinoline (TMC 207), nitroimidazole (PA-824 and OPC-67683), and moxifloxacin (MFLX). We also discussed the best clinical development plans for new-TB drugs in relation to corporate strategy. 2. Exploring novel drug targets through the chemical genomics approach and its possible application to the development of anti-tuberculosis drugs: Yorimasa SUWA (Reverse Proteomics Research Institute Co., Ltd.), Yohji SUZUKI (Teijin Ltd.) Recently, chemical genomics approach has been focused as an emerging technology for the drug discovery. In advance to a very large scale national project in US started last year, Reverse Proteomics Research Institute Co., Ltd. (REPRORI) has developed the core technologies for chemical genomics. Here we describe the outline of chemical genomics study, especially that of REPRORI, and discuss about its possible application to the development of anti-tuberculosis drugs. 3. Anti-mycobacterial agents and drug delivery: Koichi IZUMIKAWA, Hideaki OHNO, Shigeru KOHNO (Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine) Mycobacterium infection is a major clinical concern in whole world. Since the newly developed anti-mycobacterial agents are few and still unavailable in clinical settings, the applications of drug delivery system using conventional anti-mycobacterial agents are challenging to improve the compliance of treatment and better efficacy. The efficacy of anti-mycobacterial agents modified by liposome or polymer based technology have been investigated and reported using various animal models. Drug delivery system increased and prolonged the drug concentrations at the blood and targeted organs and the duration of sustained drug release, respectively. These effects lead to decrease in the frequency of drug administrations dramatically and better efficacy rates. The studies, however, were performed only in animal models, the further investigations and evaluations in human are required for practical use. 4. Adjunctive immunotherapy of mycobacterial infections: Toshiaki SHIMIZU, Katsumasa SATO, Haruaki TOMIOKA (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Shimane University School of Medicine) There is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobials and protocols for the administration of drugs that are potently efficacious against intractable mycobacterial infections. Unfortunately, development of the new drugs for solving this problem is not progressing. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",,,,2007-01-24,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

16898365,Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: evidence and controversies.,,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"In the last decade, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB, defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) has become an epidemiological issue of first priority at the global level. Case management needs to be simplified and standardised, as in many countries MDR-TB cases cannot receive individualised attention from specialist physicians. However, before any decision can be made on standardisation, a careful analysis must first be made of the evidence and controversies behind the various published recommendations. Unfortunately, the controversies outweigh the evidence. The difficulties lie not only in the absence of controlled trials to validate specific recommendations, but also in the very different and even contradictory results found in the literature. It is therefore essential to analyse these discrepancies before developing rational, uniform recommendations. The analysis should encompass the most essential and controversial issues regarding the management of MDR-TB patients: 1) confirmation of diagnosis in a suspected MDR-TB patient, and determination of the value of drug susceptibility testing; 2) the number of anti-tuberculosis drugs required to treat MDR-TB; 3) the most rational use of effective drugs against tuberculosis; 4) the advisable length of parenteral drug administration or of the initial phase of treatment; 5) the contribution of surgery to the management of MDR-TB patients; and 6) the optimal regimen for treating MDR-TB: standardised vs. individualised regimens.

We therefore evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a reduced dose of linezolid, in combination with other anti-TB drugs, in patients with intractable or extensive MDR-TB.
MDR-TB patients unresponsive to at least three cycles of treatment were treated with daily-half doses of linezolid (600 mg once per day) plus at least four companion drugs.
As of March 2006, eight patients, all HIV-negative, had been treated with linezolid for 3-18 months. Cultures became negative in all patients in an average of 82 days.

To report our experience with infliximab in the treatment of patients attending a tertiary referral service with severe recalcitrant disease.
All patients attending a tertiary referral service for severe psoriasis who were treated with infliximab between 2002 and July 2005 were entered into a prospective, open-label study. Details on disease phenotype, clinical course and adverse events were recorded together with measures of disease severity [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index, clinical photography] at baseline, weeks 2 and 6, and then at 2-monthly intervals throughout the treatment period.
Twenty-three patients were treated with infliximab during the study; one patient had pustular psoriasis and was therefore excluded from statistical analysis. All had severe disease (baseline PASI 26.5+/-6.7, mean+/-SD, n=22) and had received at least two systemic therapies for psoriasis in the past; 16 were taking one or more concomitant therapies at the time of treatment initiation. At week 10, 95% had achieved a 50% or greater improvement in baseline PASI (PASI 50), and 77% had achieved a 75% or greater improvement (PASI 75). Efficacy was sustained in the longer term, with eight of 10 patients on treatment for more than 11 months maintaining at least a PASI 50. Only one patient had treatment withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, two suffered severe systemic infections including extrapulmonary tuberculosis (splenic abscess) and cellulitis, and six have discontinued due to adverse effects including infusion reactions (two), severe thrombocytopenia (one), hepatitis (one) and malignancy (two).
Data from this open-label study suggest that infliximab is a rapidly effective treatment for patients with severe, treatment-resistant disease, although approximately 25% of patients had to discontinue therapy due to the development of serious adverse effects.

Numerous in vitro investigations have been reported on the efficacy of different antimicrobials; however, they should be evaluated in experimental infection models and clinical trials. Novel approaches are being investigated, such as inhibition of virulence factor expression by pathogens or inhibition of their metabolic pathways. The use of bacteriophages, particularly those genetically modified, remains an alternative option in the therapy of infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains.

The large collection of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 247) used included 176 (71%) multidrug-resistant isolates. The results for MGIT 960 and the RRM for rifampin and isoniazid (n = 200) were in excellent (99 to 100%) agreement for all strains. For streptomycin, 97% of the results at the critical concentration and 92% at high concentration, and for pyrazinamide 92% of results overall, were concordant, but for ethambutol, fewer than 85% (65% for the critical concentration and 84% for the high concentration) of the MGIT-based results were concordant with those for the RRM. The MGIT 960, RRM, and MPA assays (n = 133) correlated well for most second-line drugs tested. For susceptibility to ofloxacin, the MGIT 960 and MPA results were in full agreement.

We performed 81 lung resections in 79 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. All these patients had at least 2 months of medical therapy before resection. Bronchial reinforcement was performed in 4 of the 81 operations. We present here the surgical results of the 81 procedures. Because 5 of 79 patients were lost to follow-up, we provide the medical treatment results on 74 of the patients.
During this period, we performed 4 completion pneumonectomies, 39 pneumonectomies, 7 lobectomies with segmentectomy, 30 lobectomies, and 1 segmentectomy. Operative mortality was 2.5% (2/81). Bronchopleural fistula developed in 4 (4.9%) cases. Our overall cure rate was 94.5% (70/74). Relapse and treatment failure were 1.3% (1/74) and 1.3% (1/74), respectively. All but 5 patients are still under our follow-up.

An important component of the management of infections caused by this organism is antibiotic susceptibility testing. The objective of this study was to determine the drug susceptibility profiles and genotypes of clinical isolates of M. kansasii obtained from patients with or without an infection that met the American Thoracic Society's case definition criteria of M. kansasii disease. One hundred and sixty-nine clinical isolates of M. kansasii collected between 1993 and 1998 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were tested consecutively. The isolates were genotyped by PCR restriction-enzyme pattern analysis (PRA). Most of the M. kansasii strains were susceptible to isoniazid, streptomycin, rifabutin, rifampicin, clarithromycin, ethionamide, amikacin, clofazimine and cycloserine, and resistant to ethambutol, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline. Of 169 isolates, 167 belonged to the type I PRA genotype and one each belonged to type II and III genotypes. There was no correlation between PRA subtype and M. kansasii disease according to the American Thoracic Society case definition. Clinical trials may be needed to better correlate MIC values with treatment outcomes to identify appropriate parameters for drug-resistance testing of M. kansasii.",,,,2005-09-15,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
16034951,Fluoroquinolones for treating tuberculosis.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat multiple-drug-resistant and drug-sensitive tuberculosis. The effects of fluoroquinolones in tuberculosis regimens need to be assessed.
To assess fluoroquinolones as additional or substitute components to antituberculous drug regimens for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis.
We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2005), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005), EMBASE (1974 to April 2005), LILACS (1982 to April 2005), Science Citation Index (1940 to April 2005), and Russian database (1988 to April 2005). We also scanned reference lists of all identified studies and contacted researchers.
Randomized controlled trials of antituberculous regimens containing fluoroquinolones in people diagnosed with bacteriologically positive (sputum smear or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis.
Two authors independently applied inclusion criteria, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. We used relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data, weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data (both with 95% confidence intervals (CI)), and the random-effects model if we detected heterogeneity and appropriate to combine data.
Ten trials (1178 participants) met the inclusion criteria. No statistically significant difference was found in trials substituting ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin for first-line drugs in relation to cure (89 participants, 2 trials), treatment failure (388 participants, 3 trials), or clinical or radiological improvement (216 participants, 2 trials). Substituting ciprofloxacin into first-line regimens in drug-sensitive tuberculosis led to a higher incidence of relapse (RR 7.17, 95% CI 1.33 to 38.58; 384 participants, 3 trials) and longer time to sputum culture conversion (WMD 0.50 months, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 168 participants, 1 trial), although this was confined to HIV-positive participants. Adding or substituting levofloxacin to basic regimens in drug-resistant areas had no effect. A comparison of sparfloxacin versus ofloxacin added to regimens showed no statistically significant difference in cure (184 participants, 2 trials), treatment failure (149 participants, 2 trials), or total number of adverse events (253 participants, 3 trials).
Only ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin have been tested in randomized controlled trials for treating tuberculosis. We cannot recommend ciprofloxacin in treating tuberculosis. Trials of newer fluoroquinolones for treating tuberculosis are needed.

The use of antituberculosis drugs has changed tuberculosis from a disease with about a 50% mortality, treated by measures to collapse the affected lung lesions and by rest for the patient, to a condition successfully curable by chemotherapy. Key steps in the development of modern chemotherapy regimens were the demonstrations in clinical trials that (1) streptomycin was effective; (2) combination of drugs prevented the emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis; (3) chemotherapy under domiciliary conditions was effective and did not put family members at risk of infection; (4) patient compliance could be assisted by fully supervised intermittent regimens, or more effectively, by (5) shortening treatment by the introduction of rifampin and pyrazinamide, the two most potent sterilizing drugs, into the regimens. Regimens were divided into an initial intensive phase, while bacterial populations were high, and a longer continuation phase to complete sterilization.

Early and aggressive disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment of patients at risk of erosive disease has improved the outcome in the majority, but not all, RA patients. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) appears to be a key mediator of the inflammatory and destructive process in RA, and consequently inhibitors of TNF action have been tested in randomized controlled trials in patients with RA. The results of these studies have suggested that TNF inhibitors are potent DMARD particularly when combined with methotrexate. They appear well tolerated with the commonest adverse events related to their parenteral route of administration, and the serious but rare side-effects being various infections, notably tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, and worsening of cardiac failure. Treatment costs are high and range from $15 000 to $25 000 per patient per year.

15544517,Adjunctive immunotherapy of mycobacterial infections.,,Current pharmaceutical design,"In order to cope with the worldwide increase in the prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections, a number of new antimycobacterial drugs have been or are being synthesized and developed. Development of new protocols for chemotherapy of refractory mycobacterioses is also sharing promise. In this context, one promising strategy is to devise regimens to treat patients with refractory mycobacterioses using ordinary antimycobacterial agents in combination with appropriate immunomodulators. This article deals with the following matters: an outline of the host immune response to mycobacterial pathogens, particularly in terms of mobilization of the cytokine network in response to mycobacterial infection, and adjunctive immunotherapy using (1) recombinant immunomodulating cytokines, (especially Th-1 and Th-1-like cytokines such as IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and GM-CSF), (2) inhibitors of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-beta) and some proinflammatory tissue-damaging cytokines (TNF-alpha), and (3) immunomodulatory agents such as ATP and its analogs, imidazoquinoline, diethyldithiocarbamate, poloxamer, dibenzopyran, galactosylceramide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Chinese traditional medicines, levamisole, synthesized mycobacterial oligoDNA, DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial HSP65 or IL-12, and heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae. Although adjunctive immunotherapy is fairly efficacious in treating intractable mycobacterioses, it still features serious problems and dilemmas, such as high cost, occasionally severe side effects, and, in many cases, only modest efficacy in potentiating host defense mechanisms against mycobacterial infections, primarily because of the induction of macrophage-deactivating cytokines during the course of long-term administration of adjunctive agents.",,,,2004-11-17,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
15544510,Fluoroquinolones as chemotherapeutics against mycobacterial infections.,,Current pharmaceutical design,"The antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of mycobacterial infections have remained largely unchanged for several decades. Primary treatment of tuberculosis relies on four drugs, isoniazid, a rifamycin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (or streptomycin), and generally results in >95% cure in uncomplicated tuberculosis infection. Drug resistance greatly complicates treatment of this disease. Treatment of tuberculosis caused by multiply drug-resistant strains with ""second-line"" drugs remains complex, and is generally tailored to the individual patient and strain. Several of the fluoroquinolones have shown promise as second line drugs for treatment of active disease and, in combination with clarithromycin or azithromycin, ethambutol, and other agents, for treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex infection. While large clinical trials are not possible with second line drugs, clinical treatment data are available and suggest that the quinolones have various degrees of promise in treatment of these infections. Bacterial type II DNA topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, are the targets of quinolones, and provide the genetic basis for quinolone activity in mycobacteria. Mutations in these enzymes results in resistance, and characterization of resistant mutants allows correlation of genotype with susceptibility phenotype. Structure-activity relationship studies have provided further insight into optimal use of quinolones in mycobacterial infections. Care should be taken in treating pneumonia with fluoroquinolones if there is a degree of suspicion of tuberculosis, since quinolone monotherapy may rapidly select for quinolone resistance, thereby removing that class of antibiotic from the small range of treatment options.",,,,2004-11-17,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

15520489,Current trends in chemotherapy of tuberculosis.,,The Indian journal of medical research,"After treptomycin, which heralded the era of antibacterial chemotherapy for tuberculosis (TB), many important advances have made available treatment regimens that are almost 100 per cent curative. Randomised clinical trials by the Tuberculosis Research Centre, in Chennai and British Medical Research Council in East Africa and in the Far East have helped to establish many of the principles of antituberculosis chemotherapy. With successes have also come fresh challenges. Mycobacterium tuberculosis becomes rapidly resistant to the drugs used against it and in the last decade, the HIV epidemic has had an adverse impact on the global epidemiology of tuberculosis, with many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing a 2-3 fold increase in their TB burden. While the currently recommended treatment regimens are very effective, they have failed to control the burden of TB in the developing countries due to less than satisfactory implementation of the control programmes. Faced with the dual threat of multidrug resistant TB and the HIV/facilitated increase in TB, the WHO has instituted a Global TB Control Programme based on the directly observed treatment shortcourse (DOTS) strategy. Much of the principles of this strategy have come out of research in India. As part of this strategy, the Government of India is implementing a Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).

15500691,Adjuvant interferon gamma in patients with drug - resistant pulmonary tuberculosis: a pilot study.,,BMC infectious diseases,"Tuberculosis (TB) is increasing in the world and drug-resistant (DR) disease beckons new treatments.
To evaluate the action of interferon (IFN) gamma as immunoadjuvant to chemotherapy on pulmonary DR-TB patients, a pilot, open label clinical trial was carried out in the Cuban reference ward for the management of this disease. The eight subjects existing in the country at the moment received, as in-patients, 1 x 10(6) IU of recombinant human IFN gamma intramuscularly, daily for one month and then three times per week up to 6 months as adjuvant to the indicated chemotherapy, according to their antibiograms and WHO guidelines. Sputum samples collection for direct smear observation and culture as well as routine clinical and thorax radiography assessments were done monthly.
Sputum smears and cultures became negative for acid-fast-bacilli before three months of treatment in all patients. Lesion size was reduced at the end of 6 months treatment; the lesions disappeared in one case. Clinical improvement was also evident; body mass index increased in general. Interferon gamma was well tolerated. Few adverse events were registered, mostly mild; fever and arthralgias prevailed.

Disseminated processes were detected in a larger proportion of the patients with rifampicin resistance than in those with MBT susceptibility (63.6 and 40.7%, respectively (p < 0.05). Comparison of the data on MBT resistance and susceptibility, which had been obtained by bacteriological studies (nutrient medium cultuvations) and the biological chip test, revealed their agreement in 50% of the cases. A response could be showed after 2-3 months in the former case and after 2-3 days in the latter case. With the biological chip test, the resistance of MBT to rifampicin was additionally established in 38.7% of the patients with negative cultivation tests on admission and during therapy.

MBT genotyping in accordance with the polymorphism of the length of restriction fragments IS6110 has indicated that the strains of the families W and AI were prevalent in all the groups. However, the strains of mycobacteria of the W family were most frequently (62%) detected among the patients with tuberculosis with slight drug resistance.

15475636,Category based treatment of tuberculosis in children.,,Indian pediatrics,"Childhood tuberculosis is treated with multiple regimens for different clinical manifestations. World Health Organization has suggested a category-based treatment of tuberculosis that focuses on adult type of illness. To include children as DOTS beneficiaries, there is a need to assess the feasibility of classification and treatment of various types of childhood tuberculosis in different categories.
The study was conducted in the Pediatric Tuberculosis (TB) Clinic of a tertiary care hospital in North India. All children registered in the TB clinic were classified in four categories, similar to the categorization in World Health Organization's guidelines for treatment of tuberculosis in adults. All children with freshly diagnosed serious form of tuberculosis were included in category I. Category II included patients who had treatment failure, had interrupted treatment, relapse cases and those who were suspected to have drug resistant tuberculosis. Patients with primary pulmonary complex (PPC), single lymph node tuberculosis, minimal pleural effusion and isolated skin tuberculosis were included in category III. Category IV included patients who did not improve or deteriorated despite administration of 5 drugs (as per Category II) for at least 2 months.
A total of 459 patients were started on antituberculosis drugs and were available for analysis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest followed by lymph node tuberculosis. Identification of AFB was possible only in 52 (11 percent) of the patients and was more commonly seen in lymph node tuberculosis. The mean age of the children was 93 months and sex distribution was almost equal. 323 patients were in category I, 12 in category II, 120 in category III and 4 in category IV. 365 (80 percent) children completed the treatment. Of these, 302 (82.7 percent) were cured with the primary regimen assigned to them in the beginning, 54 (14.8 percent) required extension of treatment for 3 months and 9 (2.5 percent) patients required change in the treatment regimen.

15333267,[Multiple drug resistance: a threat for tuberculosis control].,,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) was reported soon after the introduction of streptomycin, although it did not receive major attention until recently. It was not considered a major issue in the industrialized world until outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) were reported among HIV infected people. Administration of standard short-course chemotherapy (SSCC) with first-line drugs under directly observed therapy (DOT) is the cornerstone of modern TB control. Unfortunately, data available on the treatment outcome of MDR-TB cases under routine programmatic conditions suggest that patients with MDR-TB respond poorly to SSCC with first-line drugs. Since 1994, the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IU-ATLD) have conducted anti-TB drug resistance surveys through a network of subregional laboratories and researchers. Drug resistance was present in almost all settings surveyed, and prevalence varied widely across regions. High prevalence of MDR-TB is widespread in the Russian Federation and areas of the former Soviet Union (Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Lithuania) as well as Israel, Liaoning and Henan Provinces in China, and Ecuador. The Global Project has surveyed areas representing over one third of notified TB cases. However, enormous gaps still exist in the most crucial areas. The most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of drug resistance is through implementation of the directly observed treatment short (DOTS) strategy. Effective implementation of the DOTS strategy saves lives through decreased TB transmission, decreased risk of emergence of drug-resistance, and decreased risk for individual TB patients of treatment failure, TB relapse, and death. The World Bank recognizes the DOTS strategy as one of the most cost-effective health interventions, and recommends that effective TB treatment be a part of the essential clinical services package available in primary health care settings. Governments are responsible for ensuring the provision of effective TB control through the DOTS strategy. WHO and its international partners have formed the DOTS-Plus Working Group, which is attempting to determine the best possible strategy to manage MDR-TB. One of the goals of DOTS-Plus is to increase access to expensive second-line anti-TB drugs for WHO-approved TB control programmes in low- and middle-income countries.",,,,2004-08-31,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
15228494,Prospects for new tuberculosis treatment in Africa.,,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,"Health services in Africa are being overburdened by a continuous increase of cases of tuberculosis (TB), largely resulting from the large pool of infected individuals becoming co-infected with HIV. To help deal with the situation, TB treatment schedules need to be shorter and simpler, with minimal contact between the patient and the service provider required, if the problems of non-compliance and of ineffective service provision are to be overcome. Various drugs not marketed for use in the treatment of TB are currently under investigation for their potential roles in the simplification or shortening of treatment schedules. These mainly include the long-acting rifamycins and the fluoroquinolones. Furthermore, new drug development is focused on an understanding of the host-pathogen interaction leading to infection, latency and disease. Of these, latency is least understood. The use of molecular diversity and combinatorial chemistry, proteomics, and the use of the whole genome to discover drug targets are expected to produce new lead compounds for turning into drugs to treat active, latent and multi-drug-resistant TB more effectively in the foreseeable future.",,,,2004-07-02,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We investigated M. tuberculosis transmission after brief exposure using a T cell-based assay, the enzyme-linked-immunospot (ELISPOT) for IFN-gamma. After childbirth, a mother was diagnosed with sputum smear-positive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Forty-one neonates and 47 adults were present during her admission on the maternity unit; 11 weeks later, all underwent tuberculin skin testing (TST) and ELISPOT. We correlated test results with markers of exposure to the index case. The participants, who were asymptomatic and predominantly had no prior tuberculosis exposure, had 6.05 hours mean exposure (range: 0-65 hours) to the index case. Seventeen individuals, including two newborns, were ELISPOT-positive, and ELISPOT results correlated significantly with three of four predefined measures of tuberculosis exposure. For each hour sharing room air with the index case, the odds of a positive ELISPOT result increased by 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02-1.09, p = 0.003). Only four adults were TST-positive and TST results did not correlate with exposure. Thus, ELISPOT, but not TST, suggested quite extensive nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis after brief exposure.

14977580,Immunotherapy with Mycobacterium vaccae in the treatment of tuberculosis.,,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,"All the trials of immunotherapy of tuberculosis with killed Mycobacterium vaccae, published or not, that are known to the authors are reviewed here. Following an introduction giving a brief account of some earlier immunotherapies for tuberculosis, the origins of the concept of immunotherapy with M.vaccae are considered. Progress is traced from the early work with irradiation-killed organisms in leprosy to the study in London of modulation of tuberculin skin-test responses, and the first comparative trials in The Gambia and Kuwait. In the last of these studies, dosages and different preparations were compared. As a result of this subsequent studies have used 109 heat-killed organisms, equivalent to 1mg wet-weight of bacilli, as a standard dose. A series of small trials in Argentina, India, Nigeria, Romania, South Africa and Vietnam have pioneered the way forward, disclosing geographic variability, with South Africa as the only country where almost no effects were recorded. Together the studies have shown that a single dose may not be sufficient. These studies have confirmed the mode of action of M.vaccae to be regulation of cell-mediated immunity with enhancement of Th1 and down-regulation of Th2, and they have shown benefits in faster bacteriological conversion, reduction in ESR, recovery of body weight and resolution of radiological opacities, leading to better recovery from the disease even when given to patients receiving directly observed therapy, short-course (DOTS). Three major randomised, placebo-controlled and partly blinded trials have been carried out in Africa. The first, in South Africa showed no M.vaccae-related effects. The second trial, in Uganda, confirmed the observations made in the earlier studies of faster sputum conversion and better radiological clearance. The third trial, in Zambia and Malawi, showed a trend towards benefits in the treatment of HIV seronegative patients but failed to show beneficial effects in HIV seropositive patients. Studies in patients with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis have shown that multiple doses of immunotherapy are required in most cases, and that these markedly improve cure-rates for these patients. This is especially so when they are also treated with chemotherapy tailored to the resistance pattern of their infecting organisms. A small study has just commenced in which repeated doses of M.vaccae are being administered to a group of patients who have failed treatment with DOTS-Plus (directly observed therapy with drugs selected on the basis of drug susceptibility profiles). Late in the investigation came publications from China supporting and confirming the data in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant disease, by the use of multiple injections of their own different preparation of M.vaccae. The trial that is now beginning in Vietnam of 3 doses of M.vaccae in the treatment of newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis, is accompanied by a chemotherapeutic regimen with a shortened continuation phase. If this important study is successful, immunotherapy with killed M.vaccae should be introduced into the treatment regimens for tuberculosis worldwide.",,,,2004-02-24,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

MEDLINE and Pre-MEDLINE (1966-June 2002) and manufacturer prescribing literature were employed to find English-language articles on infliximab. Additional studies and abstracts were identified from the bibliographies of reviewed literature and conference proceedings.
All articles identified from data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. Information regarding basic pharmacology was collected from studies in animals. Pharmacokinetic data were collected from human trials. Safety data were extracted from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. Priority was given to randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for the assessment of efficacy. All available economic evaluations were included.
Infliximab is a new monoclonal antibody that appears to work by a unique mechanism: inhibiting the action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Infliximab is administered by intravenous infusion. In clinical trials in CD, infliximab significantly decreased the CD activity index compared with placebo in treatment-resistant disease and significantly reduced the number of draining fistulas in fistulizing disease. In RA, when infliximab was added to methotrexate (MTX), it resulted in a significant improvement in most disease outcome measures when compared with MTX plus placebo. Few major adverse effects were reported in the clinical trials; however, serious adverse events, including malignancy and demyelination, have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Also, increased susceptibility to infections (including tuberculosis) has been reported.
Infliximab is an effective new agent for the treatment of CD and RA. Its apparent unique mechanism of action makes infliximab an important addition to therapy. Caution should be exercised when considering infliximab for individuals who have chronic or recurrent infections, mild congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I/II), nervous system disorders, or live or have lived in an area endemic for histoplasmosis. Infliximab is contraindicated for patients with a clinically important, active infection, moderate to severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class III/IV), or an allergy to mouse proteins or any of the ingredients in infliximab. Further long-term efficacy, safety, and economic data on infliximab are required. Also, for the treatment of RA, the burden of administering infliximab (as a 2-hour supervised infusion) has to be considered when choosing among anti-TNF-alpha medication (as the other 2 approved agents, etanercept and adalimumab, can be self-administered by subcutaneous injection).",,,,2003-08-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Several lead compounds have been found, as well as a potential drug candidate, the nitroimidazopyran PA-824. A far greater effort is needed to translate basic research into drug discovery programmes. High throughput screening and rational design must be employed to find lead compounds acting against well-validated targets and a substantial increase in resources devoted to medicinal chemistry is required to take these leads and turn them into drugs.

One-hundred-thirty new sputum smear positive patients of pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled to evaluate the bio-stimulatory effects of Gallium Arsenide laser irradiation at 890 nm, as an adjuvant therapy. These patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive either LLLT or sham irradiation (control) concomitantly with anti-tuberculosis chemotherpy.
The patients treated with semiconductor laser as an adjuvant therapy along with anti-tuberculosis drugs had a faster clearance of tubercle bacilli from the sputum as compared to the control group (P value at :45 days=0.1392, 60 days=0.0117, 75 days=0.00805, 90 days=0.00739).
These findings provide preliminary evidence that low level laser therapy with Gallium Arsenide laser may be a promising adjunctive therapy for patients with tuberculosis. Faster conversion of sputum should prevent the development of resistant mutants.",,"The patients treated with semiconductor laser as an adjuvant therapy along with anti-tuberculosis drugs had a faster clearance of tubercle bacilli from the sputum as compared to the control group (P value at :45 days=0.1392, 60 days=0.0117, 75 days=0.00805, 90 days=0.00739).",,2003-04-10,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

So far no study has evaluated the importance of childhood ARI in rural Senegal. We prospectively studied ARI, the percentage of pneumonia and related mortality, as well as the bacterial composition of nasopharyngeal flora using nasopharyngeal aspirates in 114 children, aged 2-59 months, presenting at Ndioum's pediatric ward. Excluded from the trial were those children that had had antimicrobial therapy in the previous 2 weeks. The Kirby-Bauer method was used to determine antibiotic resistance throughout the study. The percentage of ARI and pneumonia among the population tested was 24 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. Streptococcus pneumonia was often resistant to cotrimoxazole (31 per cent) but only 9 per cent were resistant to chloramphenicol and 14 per cent to penicillin. Haemophilus influenzae (HI) was uniformly sensitive to ampicillin, and only 4 per cent were resistant to chloramphenicol and 11 per cent to cotrimoxazole. We conclude that SP and HI resistance to cotrimoxazole is important and warrants larger clinical trials using chloramphenicol. Information campaigns and intense management of comorbidities are desirable in this type of population. Comorbidities (tuberculosis, malaria, HIV-AIDS, severe malnutrition) are determinant variables in many ARI cases and carry a high negative prognosis value.",,,,2003-03-13,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
12604522,Clinical concentrations of thioridazine kill intracellular multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"The phenothiazines chlorpromazine (CPZ) and thioridazine (TZ) have equal in vitro activities against antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These compounds have not been used as anti-M. tuberculosis agents because their in vitro activities take place at concentrations which are beyond those that are clinically achievable. In addition, chronic administration of CPZ produces frequent severe side effects. Because CPZ has been shown to enhance the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis at concentrations in the medium that are clinically relevant, we have investigated whether TZ, a phenothiazine whose negative side effects are less frequent and serious than those associated with CPZ, kills M. tuberculosis organisms that have been phagocytosed by human macrophages, which have nominal killing activities against these bacteria. Both CPZ and TZ killed intracellular antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant M. tuberculosis organisms when they were used at concentrations in the medium well below those present in the plasma of patients treated with these agents. These concentrations in vitro were not toxic to the macrophage, nor did they affect in vitro cellular immune processes. TZ thus appears to be a serious candidate for the management of a freshly diagnosed infection of pulmonary tuberculosis or as an adjunct to conventional antituberculosis therapy if the patient originates from an area known to have a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. Nevertheless, we must await the outcomes of clinical trials to determine whether TZ itself may be safely and effectively used as an antituberculosis agent.",,,,2003-02-27,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

To assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of Rifater (RFT)/Rifinah (RFN) in the treatment of newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis.
Patients were randomly assigned to two 6-month short-course chemotherapy regimens. One group of patients was treated with FDCs and another was given the four component drugs (INH, RMP, EMB and PZA) as separate formulations.
The 105 patients enrolled in the study were divided into two treatment groups. Fifty-one patients who had completed treatment without interruption, 26 in the FDC group and 25 in the separate regimen, were eligible for analysis at the end of 2 years. Among the patients with a drug susceptibility test result available, four in the FDC group had bacilli resistant to pyrazinamide. In the separate regimen group, two patients had bacilli resistant to ethambutol and six had bacilli resistant to pyrazinamide. The two regimens were of similar effectiveness with regard to sputum conversion, compliance and radiological improvement. No patient with FDC treatment developed gastointestinal symptoms, visual disturbance or peripheral neuropathy (P < 0.05). However, FDC treatment resulted in drug-induced fever in one patient. One patient (3.8%) in the FDC group relapsed 5 months after completing treatment.

12381217,Therapeutic drug monitoring in the treatment of tuberculosis.,,Drugs,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a standard clinical technique used for many disease states, including many infectious diseases. As for these other conditions, the use of TDM in the setting of tuberculosis (TB) allows the clinician to make informed decisions regarding the timely adjustment of drug therapy. Such adjustments may not be required for otherwise healthy individuals who are responding to the standard, four-drug TB regimens. However, some patients are slow to respond to treatment, have drug-resistant TB, are at risk of drug-drug interactions or have concurrent disease states that significantly complicate the clinical situation. Such patients may benefit from TDM and early interventions may preclude the development of further drug resistance. It is not possible to collect multiple blood samples in the clinical setting for logistical and financial reasons. Therefore, one typically is limited to one or two time points. When only one sample can be obtained, the 2-hour post-dose concentrations of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol are usually most informative. Unfortunately, low 2-hour values do not distinguish between delayed absorption (late peak, close to normal range) and malabsorption (low concentrations at all time points). A second sample, often collected at 6-hour post-dose, can differentiate between these two scenarios. The second time point can also provide some information about clearance and half-life, assuming that drug absorption was nearly completed by 2 hours. TDM requires that samples are promptly centrifuged, and that the serum is promptly harvested and frozen. Isoniazid and ethionamide, in particular, are not stable in human serum at room temperature. Rifampin is stable for more than 6 hours under these conditions. During TB treatment, isoniazid causes the greatest early reduction in organisms and is considered to be one of the two most important TB drugs, along with rifampin. Although isoniazid is highly active against TB, low isoniazid concentrations were associated with poorer clinical and bacteriological outcomes in US Public Health Services (USPHS) TB Trial 22. Several earlier trials showed a clear dose-response for rifampin and pyrazinamide, so low concentrations for those two drugs also may correlate with poorer treatment outcomes. At least in USPHS TB Trial 22, the rifampin pharmacokinetic parameters were not predictive of the outcome variables. In contrast, low concentrations of unbound rifapentine may have been responsible, in part, for the worse-than-anticipated performance of this drug in clinical trials. The 'second-line' TB drugs, including p-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine and ethionamide, are relatively weak TB drugs. Under the best conditions, treatment with these drugs takes over 2 years, as opposed to 6 to 9 months with isoniazid- and rifampin-containing regimens. Therefore, TB centres such as National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, CO, USA, measure serum concentrations of the 'second-line' TB drugs early in the course of treatment. That way, poor drug absorption can be dealt with in a timely manner. This helps to minimise the time that patients are sputum smear- and culture-positive with multidrug-resistant TB, and may prevent the need for even longer treatment durations. Patients with HIV are at particular risk for drug-drug interactions. Because the published guidelines typically reflect interactions only between two drugs, these guidelines are of limited value when the patient is treated with three or more interacting drugs. Under such complicated circumstances, TDM often is the best available tool for sorting out these interactions and placing the patient the necessary doses that they require. TDM is only one part of the care of patients with TB. In isolation, it is of limited value. However, combined with clinical and bacteriological data, it can be a decisive tool, allowing the clinician to successfully treat even the most complicated TB patients.",,,,2002-10-17,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
12235850,[Prospects for development of new antituberculous drugs].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"Tuberculosis (TB) is a growing international health concern, since it is the leading infectious cause of death in the world today. Moreover, the resurgence of TB in industrialized countries and the worldwide increase in the prevalence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in immunocompromised hosts have prompted the quest for new antimycobacterial drugs. In particular, the appearance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis, which exhibit in vitro resistance to at least two major antituberculous drug (usually INH and RFP) and cause intractable TB, has greatly contributed to the increased incidence of TB. Because of the global health problems of TB, the increasing rate of MDR-TB and the high rate of a co-infection with HIV, the development of potent new antituberculous drugs without cross-resistance with known antimycobacterial agents is urgently needed. In this article, I reviewed the following areas. First, I briefly reviewed some new findings (mainly reported after 2000) on the pharmacological status of rifamycin derivatives (rifabutin, rifapentine, and rifalazil), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, sitafloxacin, moxifloxacin, and others), and new macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromycin, and roxithromycin). Second, I described other types of agents which are being developed as antimycobacterial drugs. Some of the agents discussed are already under preliminary clinical investigation, and others appear to be promising candidates for future development. In this review, the status of the development of new antimycobacterial, especially antituberculous agents including oxazolidinone (PNU-100480), 5'-nitroimidazole (CGI 17341), 2-pyridone (ABT-255), new riminophenazines, nitroimidazopyran (PA-824), new ketolides (ABT-773, telithromycin) and defensins (human neutrophil peptide-I), was examined. Third, the development of new antitubercular drugs was discussed according to the potential pharmacological target. New critical information on the whole genome of M. tuberculosis recently elucidated and increasing knowledge on various mycobacterial virulence genes will promote the progression in the identification of genes that code for new drug targets. Using such findings on mycobacterial genomes, drug development using quantitative structure-activity relationship may be possible in the near future. In this review, I described the screening of drugs that have an inhibitory activity against dTDP-rhamnose synthesis of M. tuberculosis, as a new drug target of the organism. In addition, I discussed the usefulness of antisense oligo DNAs specific to mycobacterial genes encoding certain metabolic enzymes or virulence factors that play roles in the bacterial escape from antimicrobial mechanisms of host macrophages. Fourth, I reviewed the drug vehicles which enable efficacious drug delivery to their target in vivo. The usefulness of poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) microsphere technology, which enables the encapsulated drugs to deliver the requested doses of them for prolonged time periods by a single shot without causing any toxicity and, moreover, enables the highly targeted delivery of the drugs to host macrophages, was discussed. Fifth, I described adjunctive immunotherapy for the management of patients with mycobacterial infections by giving certain immunomodulators in combination with antimycobacterial drugs. Adjuvant clinical trials using IL-2 or GM-CSF have been found to be efficacious to some extent in improving patients with tuberculosis or disseminated MAC infections. However, it seems that these immunopotentiating cytokines as well as IFN-gamma and IL-12 are not so promising for the therapeutic agents of mycobacterial infections because of the possible induction of immunosuppressive cytokines during adjuvant therapy and, in some cases, severe side-effect. Thus, the development of new classes of immuno-modulators other than cytokines, particularly those with no severe side-effect, is needed. This review dealt with ATP and its analogues which potentiate macrophage antimycobacterial activity via a purinergic P2X7 receptor. Finally, I described the roles of type II alveolar epithelial cells in the establishment of mycobacterial infections in the host lungs and the profiles of drug susceptibilities of M. tuberculosis and MAC organisms replicating within the type II pneumocytes. These findings are useful to precisely assess or predict the in vivo therapeutic activity of a given antimycobacterial drug from its in vitro activity. In this article, I have thoroughly reviewed the status of the development of new antimycobacterial drugs. There are a number of difficulties in the drug-design for the development of new drug formulations with increased potential for antimycobacterial effects, excellent pharmacokinetics, and tolerability. It should be emphasized that the most urgent goal of chemotherapy of tuberculosis and MAC infections, especially that associated with HIV infection, is to develop highly active, low-cost drugs which can be used not only in industrialized countries but also in developing countries, since the incidences of AIDS-associated intractable tuberculosis is rapidly increasing in the latter.",,,,2002-09-19,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

11806130,[A putative immunotherapy with biological response modifiers (BRM) against intractable pulmonary tuberculosis].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"The problem of tuberculosis is emerging again with increase in the population of aged people and immunocompromised patients in Japan. It has been well documented that cell-mediated immunity play a central role in host resistance to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Many recent studies have provided evidences suggesting that the Th1-Th2 cytokine balance may determine the outcome of some diseases: predominant production of Th1 cytokines may prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases caused by intracellularly growing pathogens and Th2 cytokines may be involved in the exacerbation of allergic diseases. On the other hand, IL-12 plays an essential role in the differentiation of Th1 cells from naive T cells, and IL-18 potentiates this effect although it does not show such effect by itself. In previous investigations using gene-disrupted mice, the essential roles for IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-18 have been demonstrated. There are several host factors which determines the outcome of mycobacterial infection. Among them, steroid treatment and AIDS are important factors. In this lecture, I addressed the effect of these pathological conditions on Th1-Th2 cytokine balance and outcome of mycobacterial infection using murine models. In both conditions, the exacerbated infection was well correlated with the reduced production of IFN-gamma. Furthermore, I also talked about the relationship between other host factors and balance in the production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Using a murine model of fatal infection with M. tuberculosis, we demonstrated the therapeutic effect of Th1-type cytokines against this infection and suggested that immunotherapy with these cytokines may be clinically effective in the intractable infection. We tried a combined therapy with anti-tuberculous agents and IFN-gamma in intractable pulmonary tuberculosis caused by multidrug-resistant pathogen in a patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Although no report showing the clinical use of IL-12 in infectious diseases has been seen, clinical trials already commenced for the therapy of malignant neoplastic diseases. It may not be in far future that this cytokine is clinically used for the treatment of infectious diseases. IL-18 has not yet been under the clinical trials.",,,,2002-01-25,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

HIV complicates several areas of TB control, one of which involves treatment and treatment outcome. Large patient numbers cause congestion on TB wards, there is increased morbidity, an increased risk of adverse drug reactions, an increased case fatality, and an increased recurrence of TB after treatment completion. TB Control Programmes have responded to these problems by taking actions such as abolishing thioacetazone and decentralising the initial phase of treatment to peripheral health centres and the community. Despite this response, there are three major on-going concerns which need to be addressed by research studies. There is a need to reduce case fatality rates focusing on 1) stronger treatment regimens, 2) adequacy of rifampicin levels when intermittent treatment regimens are used, and 3) adjunctive treatments. There is a need to reduce recurrent rates of TB by 1) determining the relative role of re-infection and reactivation as a cause of recurrence, 2) assessing the importance of duration and type of anti-TB treatment for the first episode of TB, and 3) determining the role of secondary isoniazid preventive therapy. There is a need to evaluate how best to decentralise treatment from the perspective of the health service and the patient. Research studies should be relevant to the needs and resources of TB control programmes, and should include pharmacokinetic studies, controlled clinical trials and operational research, including economic analysis and social science evaluation.",,,,2002-01-05,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
11529320,Update on HIV/AIDS in Thailand.,,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,"Thailand experienced its first case of AIDS in 1984. Approximately 800,000 Thais were infected with HIV in 1995 and 1 million Thais became infected by the year 2000. There have been 5 major epidemic waves: among male homosexuals (started 1984-5), intravenous drug users (started 1988), female commercial sex workers (started 1989), male clients (started 1990), and housewives and the newborn (started 1991). Approximately 96 per cent of HIV-1 infected Thais carried recombinant subtype A/E, the rest carried B'. In a male seroconvertors cohort of 235 cases, median time to show CD4 <200 cells/microL was 6.8 years. Five years survival was significantly lower than that of the other subtype B seroconvertors study, i.e., 82 per cent compared to 90 per cent. Interestingly, 13.5 per cent of seronegative Thais showed homozygous SDF1-3'A polymorphism, which suggests that approximately one-tenth of Thais may become long-term non-progressors after HIV-1 infection. Primary HIV infection syndrome is rare among Thai patients (1.1%). In contrast, it was 50-90 per cent in Western cohorts. In early symptomatic patients, one-third developed pruritic pappular eruptions (PPEs). In advanced stage, disseminated tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), cryptococcosis, and esophageal candidiasis are commonly found. In Northern Thailand, however, Penicillium marneffei infection or penicillosis is more common than cryptococcosis. The recent understanding of HIV pathogenesis suggests that HIV eradication is unlikely to be achievable with current strategies. Several National HIV treatment guidelines including the Thai guideline have been recommended treatment with triple antiretroviral regimen when patients become symptomatics or CD4+ <200. Current development of antiretroviral therapy which includes new agents, new formulas, and pharmacokinetic enhancements, is directed to better potency, higher genetic resistant barrier, less pill burden, and once a day dosing. These will ultimately improve the adherence and the long-term effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. In reality, however, although the cost of triple regimen is dramatically declining, many patients still can not afford it. Primary prophylaxis and early diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infection should be considered in patients with CD4+ <200 cells/microL. Modified short course ZDV studies and donation campaigns for preventing mother-to-child transmission, clinical trials to investigate the best use of expensive anti HIV medications in a poor resource setting have been or are being conducted. Nine phase I/II HIV-1 vaccine trial protocols have been or are being tested. A phase III trial of gp120 subtype B/E (AIDSVAX, VaxGen) was started in 1999, a total of 2,500 volunteers will be enrolled, and interim analysis is planned for August 2002. Thai investigators are also participating in pre-clinical development of recombinant BCG and DNA vaccines. Multidisciplinary and multi-level approaches, both by the government and private sectors, have had a positive impact on the HIV epidemic as shown by the declining seroprevalence of HIV infection in Thai male conscripts, and of major sexually transmitted diseases in men. Nevertheless, more effort at the grass roots level is needed to ensure further success and sustainability of the control of the HIV epidemic in Thailand.",,,,2001-09-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Standard WHO tuberculosis outcomes and rates of sputum conversion were used as primary outcomes. Analyses were by intention-to-treat.
646 new cases were enrolled into the trial, of which 356 patients were given Russian tuberculosis treatment (155 smear positive) and 290 were given WHO short-course chemotherapy (155 smear positive). There was no statistical difference between the proportion cured or completing treatment (63% for both groups [difference in proportion=0%, 95% CI -11 to 11%]); or dying (short-course chemotherapy, 8% vs Russian, 11% [difference in proportion=-3%, 95% CI -9 to 4%]).

Patients were grouped according to the length of their histories of disease: less than or greater than 2 years duration. Initially, single doses of M. vaccae were given but subsequently up to 12 doses at 2-month intervals were given. Chemotherapy varied from isoniazid alone to drugs selected according to susceptibility tests. Most patients had failed to respond to repeated courses of chemotherapy and the majority, were expected to die from their disease. Results were assessed by sputum smear and culture and by clinical observations. Cured patients were followed for 18-24 months to exclude relapse. Eighteen of 22 (82%) patients with disease for less than 2 years were bacteriologically cured by one or two doses of M. vaccae. Among 315 chronic patients, 24 (7.6%) were cured after one dose, 37.9% after seven doses and 41.6% after 12 doses. Sixty-six chronic patients were lost to follow-up, or died, during the multi-dose regimens. Nine of 33 patients (27%) with advanced disease unaffected by several courses of chemotherapy and discharged on isoniazid alone in Vietnam were cured by 3-12 injections of M. vaccae. The data provide preliminary evidence that the addition of immunotherapy with M. vaccae to chemotherapy improves the rate of cure of MDRTB, most effectively in patients with short histories of disease, but multiple dosing can have beneficial effects in chronic patients in whom chemotherapy has failed.

TA1 is a synthetic polypeptide. The drug is in Phase III trials for the treatment of hepatitis C and in Phase II trials for hepatitis B. Additional possible indications are malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, drug-resistant tuberculosis, and DiGeorge's syndrome. TA1 is thought to modulate the immune system by augmenting T-cell function. TA1 may affect thymocytes by stimulating their differentiation or by converting them to active T cells. TA1 is rapidly absorbed, achieving peak serum concentrations within two hours. Blood levels return to baseline within 24 hours, and the serum half-life is approximately 2 hours. TA1's efficacy in hepatitis B has been evaluated in 195 patients in four clinical trials. One study found hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA clearance at six months in 9 of 17 patients receiving TA1, compared with 10 of 16 patients treated with interferon alfa-2b (IFN-alpha 2b) and 4 of 15 historical controls. An open-label trial found HBV DNA clearance in 53% of patients at six months. A randomized, controlled trial found HBV DNA clearance in 40.6% and 25.6% of patients treated with TA1 for 6 and 12 months, respectively, compared with 9.4% of untreated controls. Efficacy for hepatitis C has been evaluated in 162 patients in three clinical trials. In one trial, the number of patients who achieved normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels did not differ significantly between TA1 and placebo. In the other two trials, combination TA1 and IFN-alpha 2b was compared with IFN-alpha 2b alone. One trial found a normal serum ALT level at six months in 71% of patients receiving combination therapy, versus 35% of patients receiving IFN-alpha 2b alone. Hepatitis C virus RNA clearance occurred in 65% of patients treated with combination therapy and 29% of patients treated with IFN-alpha 2b alone. The third trial, comparing combination TA1 and IFN-alpha 2b with IFN-alpha 2b alone and with placebo, found normalization of ALT levels at six months in 37.1% of patients receiving combination therapy, 16.2% of patients receiving IFN-alpha 2b alone, and 2.7% of patients receiving placebo. TA1 is well tolerated. Most studies observed only local irritation at the injection site. For hepatitis B and C, TA1 1.6 mg (900 micrograms/m2) should be administered subcutaneously twice a week. Clinical trials of TA1 for chronic hepatitis B or C have had mixed results.

11211781,[Effectiveness and problems of PZA-containing 6-month regimen for the treatment of new pulmonary tuberculosis patients].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"One third of the world population has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the number of tuberculosis will increase worldwide without more effective programs of tuberculosis control. Despite of the presence of very potent anti-tuberculosis drugs the global tuberculosis situation is still very serious, and such gloomy feature are caused, at least partly, by the failures in the treatment of tuberculosis. The most important factor for the failure in chemotherapy is incompliance of the patients to the regimens. History of the chemotherapy of tuberculosis can be said as the history of the efforts to reduce such defaulters. Modern chemotherapy of tuberculosis has started from the discovery of streptomycin. Streptomycin monotherapy could improve temporally symptoms and bacteriological status, but could not cure the patients with moderately advanced pulmonary tuberculosis because of the emerge of drug-resistant tuberculosis. This problem was overcome by combining use of para-aminosalicylate and/or isoniazid developed later on. About 97% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis became bacteriologically quiescent by the 12 months of streptomycin, para-aminosalicylate and isoniazid. Since 1950s through 1970s three drug combination of streptomycin, para-aminosalicylate and isoniazid had been the standard regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis. By the introduction of rifampicin, the duration of chemotherapy could be shortened to 9 months. Subsequent to the successful animal experiments carried out by Grosset which demonstrated that the addition of pyrazinamide for initial 2 months to the standard two-drug combination (isoniazid and rifampicin) could remarkably shorten the duration of chemotherapy, many clinical trials have been done all over the world to compare the efficacy and safety of pyrazinamide-containing intensified short-course regimen with those of standard regimen without pyrazinamide. Sputum negative conversion rates after 2 months of treatment with PZA-regimen was 70-95%, and the relapse rates after the completion of the treatment course were less than 4%. The incidence of adverse events was less than 4%. The pyrazinamide-containing 6 months short-course regimens has been established as a new standard regimen for the initial treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis worldwide. But, in Japan, this regimen had not been adapted as the standard until April 1996 because of undue fear for high incidence of liver toxicity induced by pyrazinamide. However, in many clinical trials carried out in various parts of the world did not show any causative relationship between the higher incidence of liver toxicity and pyrazinamide. According to our own experience in Fukujuji Hospital, Japan Anti-tuberculosis Association, the frequency of drug induced hepatitis among 632 patients with normal liver function at the onset of chemotherapy was 7.9 percent (50/632) when treated with pyrazinamide-containing regimens, and was similar to that among 412 patients treated with other regimens without pyrazinamide (7.3 percent 30/412). These figures were higher than those reported in the literatures. The risk factors of drug-induced hepatitis so far reported included elderly, positive hepatitis C virus antibody, low serum albumin and so on. Such known risk factors could not wholly explain the higher rate of liver dysfunction observed among our Japanese patients. We have examined additional factors affecting the frequency of drug-induced hepatitis in our hospital, and noticed that the past history of gastrectomy and over-dosing of isoniazid (> or = 7.5 mg/kg) and/or pyrazinamide (> or = 30 mg) were relating to the higher incidence of drug-induced hepatitis. Another important finding is that the relapse rate among patients complicated with diabetes mellitus is significantly higher than that of the patients without diabetes mellitus (6.31/100 person-years vs 0.90/100 person-years, P < 0.001).

11144551,New diagnostic tools for tuberculosis.,,The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of symptomatic patients is a cornerstone of global tuberculosis control strategies. Remarkable progress has recently been made, upgrading the speed and quality of mycobacteriology diagnostic services in industrialized countries, but for most of the world where TB is a large public health burden those gains are still unrealized. Deficiencies in current case-finding tools in disease endemic countries have made it difficult to ensure access to good diagnostics at all health service levels, leaving many patients undiagnosed. Additionally, in well-established TB control programs where diagnostic access has been ensured, efforts to interrupt disease transmission have been hampered by the insensitivity and late detection of smear microscopy. Fortunately, technical progress in diagnostics is resulting in a number of improved tools, including some appropriate for low-income settings. Important work remains, however, before new diagnostic tools can be meaningfully integrated into national TB control programs of high-burden countries and before TB control strategies can take them into account. The design and quality of clinical trials evaluating new diagnostics must be improved, clinical and laboratory services that would allow rapid response to test results need to be enhanced, and basic and operational research to appraise the impact and cost-effectiveness of new diagnostic technologies must be carried out.

The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic and the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Improvements in diagnosis, vaccination, chemoprophylaxis, and therapy are thus urgently needed. Molecular techniques are facilitating the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests and the rational approach to the production of new vaccines. New forms of treatment are being investigated and there is also considerable emphasis on optimizing the deployment of the available treatment regimens. This has resulted in the World Health Organization's five-point directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS) strategy and proposed modifications (DOTS-plus) for the management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. Despite these advances, it is becoming abundantly clear that the failure to control tuberculosis is a direct consequence of the gross inequities in the distribution of wealth and health care provision worldwide, which do not allow for putting advances in the management of tuberculosis into practice.

To compare a 2-month regimen of daily rifampin and pyrazinamide with a 12-month regimen of daily isoniazid in preventing tuberculosis in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
Randomized, open-label controlled trial conducted from September 1991 to May 1996, with follow-up through October 1997.
Outpatient clinics in the United States, Mexico, Haiti, and Brazil.
A total of 1583 HIV-positive persons aged 13 years or older with a positive tuberculin skin test result.
Patients were randomized to isoniazid, 300 mg/d, with pyridoxine hydrochloride for 12 months (n = 792) or rifampin, 600 mg/d, and pyrazinamide, 20 mg/kg per day, for 2 months (n = 791).

10705306,Aerosolized interferon-alpha treatment in patients with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.,,European cytokine network,"Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has emerged as an obstacle to the control of tuberculosis. Recent data however, suggest that interferon-(IFN)-gamma and IFN-alpha may improve disease evolution in subjects affected with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by multi-resistant (IFN-gamma) and sensitive (IFN-alpha) strains. The mechanisms involved are not known, even though it has been reported that IFN-gamma-secreting CD4+ Th cells may possess antitubercular effects. In addition, IFN-alpha can induce IFN-gamma secretion by CD4+ Th cells, and both types of IFN may stimulate macrophage activities. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility that aerosolized IFN-alpha, administered concomitantly with conventional antitubercular chemotherapy, may improve the course of pulmonary tuberculosis. After six months of directly observed therapy (DOT), seven patients who were non-responders to a second line antitubercular therapy were given an IFN-alpha aerosol (3 MU, three times a week) for two months as adjunctive therapy. All strains were resistant to at least two first-line drugs. After IFN-alpha administration, the patients were followed up for a further six months with the same DOT. Sputum samples were collected monthly during the study period, with the exception of the IFN-alpha administration period, when the observations were performed weekly. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scans were performed before and after IFN-alpha inhalations. The analysis of the results showed that the mean number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) had remained statistically unchanged (p = 0.80) during the first 6 months of DOT. During the following 2 months of IFN-alpha administration, 5 patients became negative (p = 0.02). After the end of treatment a progressive increase in Mt number was observed (p = 0. 02). Sputum cultures remained positive for all patients throughout the study period, although a significant decrease (p = 0.02) in the colony number per culture was observed after adjunctive treatment with IFN-alpha. After stopping administration of IFN-alpha, a significant increase (p = 0.03) in the colony number per culture was noted as well as in Mt numbers. HRCT scans were slightly improved in all patients. These preliminary data suggest that aerosolized IFN-alpha may be a promising adjunctive therapy for patients with MDR-TB.

10551435,Treatment and prevention of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,Drugs,"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), which is defined as combined resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, is a 'man-made' disease that is caused by improper treatment, inadequate drug supplies or poor patient supervision. Patients with MDRTB face chronic disability and death, and represent an infectious hazard for the community. Cure rates of 96% have been achieved but require prompt recognition of the disease, rapid accurate susceptibility results, and early administration of an individualised re-treatment regimen. Such regimens are usually based on a quinolone and an injectable agent (i.e. an aminoglycoside or capreomycin) supplemented by other 'second-line' drugs. This therapy is prolonged (e.g. 24 months), expensive, and has multiple adverse effects. Prevention of MDRTB is therefore of paramount importance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a multifaceted programme, known by the acronym DOTS (directly observed therapy, short-course), that promotes effective treatment of drug-susceptible TB as the prime method of limiting drug resistance. DOTS was part of a successful MDRTB control programme in New York City, which also included treatment of prevalent MDRTB cases, streamlined laboratory testing, effective infection control procedures and wider application of screening and preventive therapy (although the optimal chemotherapy for MDRTB infection remains undefined). Industrialised countries have the resources to treat patients with MDRTB and to mount these extensive control programmes. Unfortunately, MDRTB is also prevalent in Asia, South America and the former Soviet Union. First world countries have a vested interest, as well as a moral responsibility, to assist in controlling MDRTB in these 'hot spots'.",,,,1999-11-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The Japanese journal of clinical pathology,"A newly developed microdilution antimycobacterial susceptibility test, BrothMIC MTB (Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) was evaluated at multisites. The test method utilizes air-dried microplates containing serially diluted antimicrobial agents and the modified Middlebrook 7H9 broth. The eight antimycobacterial agents tested were rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The test plates were reconstituted by inoculation of 0.2 ml of cell suspensions (6 x 10(5) cells/ml) and were incubated at 36 degrees C in 5% to 10% CO2. The growth endpoints were visually read after 7-day and 10-day incubations. The reproducibility was evaluated with the four reference strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and were compared with the agar proportion method described in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) M24-T. Of the 1,022 testings of the reference strains, 1,020 (99.8%) of the MICs read after 7-day incubation fell within 3 log2 dilutions. The growth endpoints read after 7-day and 10-day incubations gave equal MIC ranges for the respective agents. The results obtained by the BrothMIC MTB for 93 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis compared well with those determined by the NCCLS method with 98% to 99% agreements, except for ethambutol. According to the comparative analysis with the agar proportion method, the interpretive MIC breakpoints to discriminate between the isolates susceptible and resistant against the respective agents were proposed. In conclusion, this newly developed microdilution test for M. tuberculosis is a practical, rapid, quantitative, nonradiometric alternative for the determination of MICs in clinical mycobacteriology laboratories.",,,,1999-10-08,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
10496301,Pharmacokinetic factors in the modern drug treatment of tuberculosis.,,Clinical pharmacokinetics,"Tuberculosis is increasing in prevalence throughout the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America. This resurgence can partly be attributed to increasing poverty, particularly in developing countries, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic. However, there is also increasing concern at the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis caused by the misuse of the agents available. The modern treatment of patients with tuberculosis should start, in most cases, with 4 first-line agents in order to minimise the risk of drug resistance developing. A6-month drug regimen is usually satisfactory for pulmonary and nonpulmonary tuberculosis, although not for patients with tuberculous meningitis, in whom a longer course of treatment is required. Coinfection with HIV may produce an atypical clinical and radiological presentation, but the treatment regimen is essentially similar to other situations. Several of the first-line agents, in particular rifampicin (rifampin) and isoniazid, are likely to cause clinically significant drug interactions and/or toxicity, particularly in patients with HIV infection. Consideration of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between the host, the mycobacterium and the drug may contribute to the development of pharmacokinetically optimised regimens that make best use of the existing range of antituberculosis drugs. However, such idealised regimens need to be tested in prospective clinical trials. The use of therapeutic drug monitoring in selected groups of patients may improve outcomes, avoid drug toxicity and reduce the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis requires a high level of clinical expertise and such patients should start on at least 5 drugs to which the organism is thought to be susceptible. Up to 50% of patients with tuberculosis may not adhere to their drug regimen, resulting in persisting infectiousness, relapse or the development of drug resistance. Directly observed treatment with antituberculosis drugs, combined with a serious commitment to tuberculosis control, is required if we are to combat this increasing epidemic.",,,,1999-09-25,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Inappropriate treatment of tuberculosis is responsible for the development of MDR-TB. MDR-TB is often accompanied with the immunosuppression of the host. Given that we are unable to develop another potent anti-TB drug in near future, immunotherapy directed at combating immunosuppression and enhancing the host's own immune response is an attractive approach to supplement conventional chemotherapy for MDR-TB. Patients with AIDS and patients with abnormalities of macrophage function have frequent problems with TB. This is suggesting that the host defenses involved in protection against mycobacteria include T-cell and monocyte/macrophage functions. That is cell-mediated immunity. Diverse cytokines are known to play an important role in anti-TB cell-mediated immunity, including IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-gamma. Various animal experiments are indicating that administration of these cytokine (s) did recover the suppressed immunity and rescued the host from death by tuberculous infection. However, we have to keep it in mind that the results obtained from animal model of mycobacterial infection on the study of pathogenesis and immune responses in TB is not always applicable to the understanding of human TB. Clinical trial of inhalation therapy with IFN-gamma showed some improvement for drug-resistant TB. Cytokine treatment, however, often gave some deleterious side effects such as high fever, malaise, general edema and even the death of the host. Clinical trials with M. vaccae have been extensively conducted by UK group. The mechanisms underlying its possible therapeutic action remain to be clarified, but when administered at an appropriate dose, it has been shown to elicit a strong Th1 immune response. From the practical view point of immunotherapy for TB, surrogate markers of disease eradication and protective immunity are urgently required. Such markers would facilitate clinical trials by providing early evidence that test compounds or vaccines are effective. Even during the era when no potent chemotherapeutic agents were available, one third of the patients with TB survived the disease and enjoyed the entire lives. Then the question is what determines the alternative: survival or death following development of drug resistant TB. Is it host immune responsiveness or virulence of the microbe, or both?

10067058,[Clinical evaluation of new quinolones as antituberculosis drugs].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"Compared with the recent rapid advances in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, advances in the treatment of tuberculosis have been quite slow. For example, as long as six months are required for initial treatment, even with addition of pyrazinamide in the first two months to isoniazid, rifampicin, and streptomycin or ethambutol. Moreover, it is not always easy to treat patients who cannot receive standard agents including isoniazid and rifampicin due to adverse effects of these drugs or drug resistance. For these reasons, the development of new agents with potent antituberculosis activities and fewer adverse effects is urgently desired. However, at present, few new antituberculosis agents are being developed, and new quinolones are considered the most promising new antituberculosis agents due to their lack of cross-resistance to previously existing antituberculosis agents, their excellent in vitro and in vivo antituberculous activities, and good pharmacokinetics. We therefore reviewed experimental studies and clinical reports useful for evaluation of potential clinical use of new quinolones as antituberculosis drugs. Our conclusions are summarized below: 1) Of nine new quinolones on the market, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, aparfloxacin and levofloxacin have excellent in vitro and in vivo antituberculous activities without cross-resistance to previously existing antituberculosis agents. 2) Ofloxacin appears to be useful clinically for intractable multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The incidence and severity of adverse effects of ofloxacin were very low on longterm administration. 3) Ofloxacin resistance emerged from two to four months after initiation of administration of ofloxacin, and ofloxacin exhibited cross-resistance to other new quinolones. 4) The usefulness of new quinolones for initial treatment of tuberculosis is unclear. 5) New quinolones should be used to treat patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis and those patients for whom adverse effects have limited the use of standard agents. However, monotherapy with new quinolones is not recommended, due to the significant risk of emergence of quinolone resistance. 6) Not only ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin, which are on the market, but also gatifloxacin, CS-940, Du-6859a and other newly developed new quinolones are candidates for new antituberculosis agents. However, careful study not only of antituberculous activities and pharmacokinetic but also drug interactions and chronic cumulative toxicities due to long-term administration are needed prior to clinical application of these drugs.",,,,1999-03-06,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

10028083,Issues in the treatment of active tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.,,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"Most HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis can be treated satisfactorily with standard regimens with expectations of good results. Treatment of tuberculosis in these patients has been complicated by the introduction of HAART, which relies on drugs that interfere with the most potent class of antituberculous medications. Rifampin-free regimens or regimens that employ rifabutin may be acceptable strategies for patients who are receiving protease inhibitors, although these regimens have not been rigorously evaluated in patients with AIDS. At present, there is good reason to believe that a 6-month course of a rifabutin-containing regimen or a 9-12-month course of a regimen of streptomycin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide should be adequate therapy for most patients with drug-susceptible disease. As the treatment of HIV infection with antiretroviral agents evolves, the treatment of tuberculosis in patients with AIDS is likely to evolve as well.

Administration of low dose recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhuIL-2) in combination with chemotherapy to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients resulted in reduced or cleared sputum acid-fast bacilli in about 60% of the patients in association with enhanced activation of the immune system. Daily rhuIL-2 administration for 30 days induced increases in CD25+ and CD56+ cells in the blood. rhuIL-2 therapy also resulted in increased expression of gamma-interferon and IL-2 mRNA at the site of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to purified protein derivative of tuberculin. Differential display reverse transcriptase PCR revealed several genes expressed at the DTH skin test site that were up- or down-regulated during rhuIL-2 treatment. The differentially regulated genes included components of endocytic vacuoles, enzymes of the respiratory pathway and other regulators of cellular function. The physiological importance of the differential expression of these genes is under investigation to determine their roles in leukocyte activation and in the development of an antimycobacterial response.",,,,1999-02-09,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

9809743,Prevention and treatment of tuberculosis among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus: principles of therapy and revised recommendations. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,,MMWR. Recommendations and reports : Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Recommendations and reports,"These guidelines update previous CDC recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis (TB) among adults and children coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. The most notable changes in these guidelines reflect both the findings of clinical trials that evaluated new drug regimens for treating and preventing TB among HIV-infected persons and recent advances in the use of antiretroviral therapy. In September 1997, when CDC convened a meeting of expert consultants to discuss current information about HIV-related TB, special emphasis was given to issues related to coadministration of TB therapy and antiretroviral therapy and how to translate this information into management guidelines. Thus, these guidelines are based on the following scientific principles: * Early diagnosis and effective treatment of TB among HIV-infected patients are critical for curing TB, minimizing the negative effects of TB on the course of HIV, and interrupting the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to other persons in the community. * All HIV-infected persons at risk for infection with M. tubercu losis must be carefully evaluated and, if indicated, administered therapy to prevent the progression of latent infection to active TB disease and avoid the complications associated with HIV-related TB. * All HIV-infected patients undergoing treatment for TB should be evaluated for antiretroviral therapy, because most patients with HIV-related TB are candidates for concurrent administration of antituberculosis and antiretroviral drug therapies. However, the use of rifampin with protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors is contraindicated. Ideally, the management of TB among HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral drugs requires a) directly observed therapy, b) availability of experienced and coordinated TB/HIV care givers, and in most situations, c) use of a TB treatment regimen that includes rifabutin instead of rifampin. Because alternatives to the use of rifampin for antituberculosis treatment are now available, the previously recommended practice of stopping protease inhibitor therapy to allow the use of rifampin for TB treatment is no longer recommended for patients with HIV-related TB. The use of rifabutin-containing antituberculosis regimens should always include an assessment of the patient's response to treatment to decide the appropriate duration of therapy (i.e., 6 months or 9 months). Physicians and patients also should be aware that paradoxical reactions might occur during the course of TB treatment when antiretroviral therapy restores immune function. Adding to CDC's current recommendations for administering isoniazid preventive therapy to HIV-infected persons with positive tuberculin skin tests and to HIV-infected persons who were exposed to patients with infectious TB, this report also describes in detail the use of new shortcourse (i.e., 2 months) multidrug regimens (e.g., a rifamycin, such as rifampin or rifabutin, combined with pyrazinamide) to prevent TB in persons with HIV infection. A continuing education component for U.S. physicians and nurses is included.",,,,1998-11-11,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
9806107,Rifapentine.,,Drugs,"Rifapentine is a rifamycin antibiotic with antimycobacterial activity. Rifapentine is generally more active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis than rifampicin (rifampin), although strains resistant to rifampicin are usually cross-resistant to rifapentine. Sputum culture conversion rates were slightly higher after 6 months of rifapentine- versus rifampicin-based therapy in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in a Western study; however, relapse rates were higher in rifapentine recipients during follow-up. The excess relapses in the rifapentine group appeared to be related to poor compliance with nonrifamycin antituberculosis drugs during the intensive phase (first 2 months) of therapy. Rifapentine- and rifampicin-containing regimens produced similar sputum culture conversion rates with low rates of relapse in 2 randomised clinical trials in patients with smear-positive tuberculosis in China. In one trial, there was no difference in sputum culture conversion rates in patients treated with rifapentine once weekly or rifampicin twice weekly in combination with isoniazid and ethambutol during the continuation phase of treatment. Hyperuricaemia, which was reported only during the intensive phase, elevated ALT and AST levels and neutropenia were the most common treatment-related adverse events reported in patients receiving rifapentine- or rifampicin-containing regimens for tuberculosis in 1 Western study.",,,,1998-11-07,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
9802271,Randomised controlled trial of self-supervised and directly observed treatment of tuberculosis.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Tuberculosis is a major public-health problem in South Africa, made worse by poor adherence to and frequent interruption of treatment. Direct observation (DO) of tuberculosis patients taking their drugs is supposed to improve treatment completion and outcome. We compared DO with self-supervision, in which patients on the same drug regimen are not observed taking their pills, to assess the effect of each on the success of tuberculosis treatment.
We undertook an unblinded randomised controlled trial in two communities with large tuberculosis caseloads. The trial included 216 adults who started pulmonary tuberculosis treatment for the first time, or who had a second course of treatment (retreatment patients). No changes to existing treatment delivery were made other than randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. Individual patient data from the two communities were combined.
Treatment for tuberculosis was more successful among self-supervised patients (60% of patients) than among those on DO (54% of patients, difference between groups 6% [90% CI -5.1 to 17.0]). Retreatment patients had significantly more successful treatment outcomes if self-supervised (74% of patients) than on DO (42% of patients, difference between groups 32% [11%-52%]).
At high rates of treatment interruption, self-supervision achieved equivalent outcomes to clinic DO at lower cost. Self-supervision achieved better outcomes for retreatment patients.

Twenty-three patients had 31 tests. The mean CD4 cell count was 20/mm3. The tests were negative in 16 patients, of whom 12 have not developed CMV end-organ disease after a mean follow up of 114 days (range 14-269 days), whilst the remaining 4 patients had previously treated CMV disease. Eleven patients had positive tests: 4 had active CMV disease, 2 subsequently developed CMV retinitis, 2 died within a fortnight of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), one was lost to follow up and 2 have remained disease-free.

Because of poor bioavailability of the rifapentine used (produced in China), its dose size was increased from 600 mg initially to about 750 mg in the last third of patients to obtain serum concentrations similar to those with rifapentine of Western origin; all doses were given after a meal promoting absorption. After initial exclusions, an intent to treat analysis, done on the remaining 592 patients, showed 45 adverse treatment events in 7 of 190 HR3 patients, in 17 of 199 HRp1 patients, and in 21 of 203 HRp1.2/3 patients; of these, 42 were bacteriological or radiographic relapses after the end of treatment (HR3 versus HRp1, p = 0.04; HR3 versus HRp1.2/3, p = 0.01). Patients with organisms initially sensitive or resistant to isoniazid or streptomycin had similar relapse rates. The high relapse rate in the HRp1 regimen suggests that the rifapentine dose should be increased. Similarity of relapse rates, 8.9% and 10.4%, after the HRp1 and HRp1.2/3 regimens, respectively, indicates that irregularity in taking rifapentine/isoniazid could be tolerated.

For several years, WHO, IUTATLD and CDC have recommended that HIV-positive patients testing positive in a PPD test should be treated with INH as a form of anti-tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis (ATC). Whilst these recommendations are easy to follow in industrialized countries, widespread use of ATC in developing countries remains problematic because: (i) It is unknown what proportion of patients are likely to be re-infected at the end of ATC in countries where TB is endemic; (ii) It is possible that resistant bacilli may be selected due to the incomplete exclusion from the ATC program of patients with active TB at enrollment; (iii) It is difficult to identify asymptomatic carriers of M. tuberculosis at enrollment; (iv) It is doubtful that all patients will comply with a treatment regime which lasts several months; (v) The cost of a widespread ATC program, whose full benefit remains to be evaluated, may be difficult to justify.

A review of recent studies in patients with AIDS.,,Drugs,"In patients with AIDS, disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection is a common bacterial infection and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. In placebo-controlled studies, rifabutin, clarithromycin and azithromycin (administered as single agents) have been shown to prevent the development of MAC bacteraemia in patients with advanced HIV disease. Clarithromycin also conferred a survival benefit over placebo, but this was not initially observed with either rifabutin or azithromycin. Subsequently, the efficacy of single agent therapy was compared with that of combination treatment as prophylaxis against the development of disseminated MAC. In the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 196/Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA) 009 study, clarithromycin monotherapy and clarithromycin and rifabutin combination therapy regimens were both more effective than rifabutin monotherapy in reducing the incidence of MAC bacteraemia. However, the combination regimen was generally not well tolerated. In the California Consortium Treatment Group (CCTG)/Multiple Opportunistic Prevention Prophylactic Strategy (MOPPS) study, azithromycin plus rifabutin was significantly more effective than either agent administered alone, and azithromycin was more effective than rifabutin. However, azithromycin (alone or in combination with rifabutin) caused frequent gastrointestinal adverse events. Emergence of resistance in those failing prophylaxis appeared to be higher with clarithromycin than with azithromycin or rifabutin. The use of the combination regimen of clarithromycin plus rifabutin did not reduce the selection of clarithromycin-resistant isolates. Several issues need to be considered in the choice of MAC prophylaxis for the individual patient. On the basis of efficacy and potential drug interactions with protease inhibitors, clarithromycin or azithromycin is preferred to rifabutin. However, rifabutin is less likely to result in the emergence of resistance than the macrolides, and is likely to prevent tuberculosis, whereas azithromycin and clarithromycin will prevent some bacterial infections.

In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race.

The activity induced by IFN-gamma encompasses all classes of non-viral pathogens including intracellular and extracellular parasites, fungi and bacteria. In man, treatment with immuno-enhancing doses of IFN-gamma is safe, well-tolerated and stimulates the antimicrobial mechanisms of blood monocytes, circulating neutrophils and tissue macrophages. Aerosol administration activates alveolar macrophages in a compartmentalized fashion. Monocytes from IFN-gamma-treated patients with cancer, leprosy, and AIDS all respond with the activated phenotype, and suppressed monocyte HLA-DR expression in trauma patients can be up-regulated by IFN-gamma therapy. Thus far, IFN-gamma has been recognized as effective in the prophylaxis of chronic granulomatous disease and as adjunctive treatment in at least one systemic intracellular infection, visceral leishmaniasis. Additional trials suggest beneficial effects as prophylaxis in trauma and as treatment in leprosy, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and HIV- and non-HIV-related disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection. IFN-gamma is also being tested as a prophylaxis in patients with burns and advanced HIV infection and as an adjunct in drug-resistant tuberculosis. Future antimicrobial applications for IFN-gamma include: a) long-term prophylaxis in T cell-deficient states, b) short-term prophylaxis in patients with a reversible host defense defect such as granulocytopenia or immune response suppression induced by trauma or burn injury, and c) adjunctive treatment along with conventional antibiotic therapy for i) nosocomial pneumonia (aerosol administration), ii) opportunistic infections in general, iii) infections which typically respond poorly to available treatment and iv) for infections which require prolonged therapy for cure.

Recent trial data are discussed in response to questions about prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic pathogens such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). It is suggested that scientists are close to refining assays for CMV, and perhaps MAC, that will allow clinicians to predict which patients have a substantially increased risk of cytomegalovirus or MAC disease.

Recommendations and reports : Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Recommendations and reports,"This report updates and replaces previous recommendations regarding the use of Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) vaccine for controlling tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (MMWR 1988;37:663-4, 669-75). Since the previous recommendations were published, the number of TB cases have increased among adults and children, and outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB have occurred in institutions. In addition, new information about the protective efficacy of BCG has become available. For example, two meta-analyses of the published results of BCG vaccine clinical trials and case-control studies confirmed that the protective efficacy of BCG for preventing serious forms of TB in children is high (i.e., > 80%). These analyses, however, did not clarify the protective efficacy of BCG for preventing pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults; this protective efficacy is variable and equivocal. The concern of the public health community about the resurgence and changing nature of TB in the United States prompted a re-evaluation of the role of BCG vaccination in the prevention and control of TB. This updated report is being issued by CDC, the Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, in consultation with the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, to summarize current considerations and recommendations regarding the use of BCG vaccine in the United States. In the United States, the prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection and active TB disease varies for different segments of the population; however, the risk for M. tuberculosis infection in the overall population is low. The primary strategy for preventing and controlling TB in the United States is to minimize the risk for transmission by the early identification and treatment of patients who have active infectious TB. The second most important strategy is the identification of persons who have latent M. tuberculosis infection and, if indicated, the use of preventive therapy with isoniazid to prevent the latent infection from progressing to active TB disease. Rifampin is used for preventive therapy for persons who are infected with isoniazid-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. The use of BCG vaccine has been limited because a) its effectiveness in preventing infectious forms of TB is uncertain and b) the reactivity to tuberculin that occurs after vaccination interferes with the management of persons who are possibly infected with M. tuberculosis. In the United States, the use of BCG vaccination as a TB prevention strategy is reserved for selected persons who meet specific criteria. BCG vaccination should be considered for infants and children who reside in settings in which the likelihood of M. tuberculosis transmission and subsequent infection is high, provided no other measures can be implemented (e.g., removing the child from the source of infection). In addition, BCG vaccination may be considered for health-care workers (HCWs) who are employed in settings in which the likelihood of transmission and subsequent infection with M. tuberculosis strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin is high, provided comprehensive TB infection-control precautions have been implemented in the workplace and have not been successful. BCG vaccination is not recommended for children and adults who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus because of the potential adverse reactions associated with the use of the vaccine in these persons. In the United States, the use of BCG vaccination is rarely indicated. BCG vaccination is not recommended for inclusion in immunization or TB control programs, and it is not recommended for most HCWs. Physicians considering the use of BCG vaccine for their patients are encouraged to consult the TB control programs in their area.",,,,1996-04-26,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
8785257,Use of rifabutin in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.,,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"This article reviews recent studies conducted outside the United States assessing the efficacy and safety of rifabutin in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected patients, in patients with newly diagnosed TB, and in patients with multidrug-resistant TB. A 6-month pilot study of 50 Ugandan patients with TB associated with HIV infection showed that rifabutin and rifampin were similarly effective with regard to conversion of sputum-smear findings (sputum conversion) and in bringing about clinical and radiologic improvement. Compared with rifampin, rifabutin showed potential for reducing the time to sputum conversion for these patients. Multicenter studies in five countries compared two rifabutin dosages (150 mg/d and 300 mg/d) with rifampin as part of a combination regimen for treatment of newly diagnosed TB in 935 patients. Rifabutin compared favorably with rifampin in sputum conversion; administration of 150 mg/d of rifabutin yielded good results and the fewest adverse effects. The use of rifabutin by 270 patients in five countries who had multidrug-resistant TB (approximately 90% of isolates tested were resistant to rifampin and isoniazid) was assessed in another study. For the majority of these patients, signs and symptoms diminished; one-third had bacteriologic conversions.",,,,1996-04-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
8621857,The effects of prednisolone on the cutaneous tuberculin response in patients with corticosteroid-resistant bronchial asthma.,,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,"We have used the classical tuberculin cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity immune response to investigate the effects of corticosteroids on mononuclear cell function in nine subjects with corticosteroid-resistant asthma (CRA) and six subjects with corticosteroid-sensitive asthma (CSA), who demonstrated sensitivity to intradermal purified protein derivative (PPD) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, patients were given oral prednisolone or placebo, starting on day 0, and a predetermined intradermal dose of PPD on day 7. On day 9 the site of the induration was measured and biopsied for immunohistochemical analysis. There was no difference in skin induration between the CSA and CRA groups during the placebo arm of the study (p = 0.38). Prednisolone significantly suppressed the cutaneous induration (p, 0.003) in the CSA group but not in the CRA group. As compared with placebo, the number of macrophages (p = 0.018), eosinophils (p = 0.009), and T memory cells (p = 0.009) was suppressed by prednisolone in the CSA group but not in the CRA group. No significant suppression of the number of neutrophils or monocytes/immature macrophages was induced by prednisolone in either group. There was no difference in intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression in blood vessels or epidermis between the CSA and CRA groups, with no suppression by prednisolone in either group. These findings suggest a defect in the responsiveness of cellular immune mechanisms to the suppressive effects of corticosteroids in steroid-resistant asthma. The differential suppressive effects of corticosteroids on cellular recruitment in the PPD response between the individuals with CSA and those with CRA are not due to modulation of expression of endothelial adhesion molecules.",,,,1996-02-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

A transversal study was carried out in 8 hospitals (6 general hospitals) during 6 months. The clinical data of patients over 14 years old who presented a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were collected in a protocolized method; the study on sensitivity to 5 drugs was independently and centrally performed (proportions method).
467 patients (339 from general hospitals), were included. In respect to the latter patients, 71% were under the age of 45 years and 36% presented coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A sensitivity study was performed in 419 strains. Forty strains showed resistance to one or more of the antituberculous drugs; 13 were from the same center (CIC) in which a nosocomial outbreak of multiresistent TB had been detected among HIV infected patients. Resistence to more than one drug was observed in 29 cases (6.9%) and to rifampicine (RIF) and isoniacide (INH) in 24 patients (5.7%).

Among 365 analysed patients 55% were below the age of 50 (of whom 61% had initial drug resistance and 47% had acquired resistance). Among these patients 52% had initial and 48% acquired drug resistance. In 193 patients (i.e. 54%) resistance to one drug (in 97 patients to isoniazid-H, in 80 to streptomycin-S and in 5 to rifampicin-R was observed. Resistance to two drugs was observed in 25% of patients and among them a majority (57%) was resistant to H and S and 23% to H and R. In 11% of patients, resistance to three drugs was observed, in 8% to four drugs, and in 4% to five or more drugs. Multidrug resistance (at least H and R) was observed in 97 patients (25% of the total number) and in 76 patients resistance to other than H and R drugs was observed. Among the total number of analysed patients in 263 (72%) resistance to H was observed, in 208-to S, and in 102 to R. Among patients with initial drug resistance, the majority was resistant to one drug and among those with acquired resistance the majority was resistant to two or more drugs. On the basis of this analysis the estimated total initial drug resistance-2. 8% is 6-8 times lower than 30-40 years ago and have remained at this low level for at least 20 recent years.

8980863,Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in China.,,Chemotherapy,"During the past decade the number and gravity of tuberculosis (TB) cases has continued to increase, both in developing and industrialized nations. Coupled with the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the possibility that untreatable forms of the disease may become widespread has arisen. In China, the prevalence rate of smear-positive cases from three national surveys in 1979, 1984-1985 and 1990 was 187, 156 and 134/100,000, respectively, thus giving an annual average reduction rate of only 3.0%. This may be due to the accumulation of chronic cases, which is not surprising given that as many as 84.3% of new smear-positive cases received non-organized chemotherapy. To counteract this situation, a strategy was developed in Beijing to practice fully supervised chemotherapy for all new smear-positive cases. This is now 90% with a cure rate also of 90%. As a result, the prevalence rate of smear-positive cases has dropped, with an average annual reduction of 17%. Building upon this success, the World Bank Loan TB Control Project in China has been carried out in 12 provinces with 550 million people since 1992. The main objective of this project is to provide fully supervised, 6-month short-course chemotherapy for all newly detected smear-positive cases. The cure rate based on cohort analysis was 88% in 1993. Complete data are not available on resistance although the initial and acquired resistance rates were 28.1 and 41.1%, respectively.

There has been a slight change in the total number of TB cases notified since 1985 when the first case of HIV infection was reported. Although there is an increase in the incidence of TB in HIV-infected cases, the percentage of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in this group is the same as in the HIV-negative group (2.7%). The percentages of total initial drug resistance, four-drug resistance and MDR-TB have increased to 22.4, 1.4 and 4.8%, respectively. Comparable figures for acquired resistance are up to 2.5-, 10- and 6-fold, respectively. The rapid diagnosis and susceptibility pattern of MDR-TB are essential for improving therapeutic outcome. At present there is no defined standard regimen for MDR-TB and clinical practice has been to select a regimen of three to four sensitive or not previously exposed anti-TB drugs. Duration of treatment for 24-30 months depends on severity, previous therapy and the number of drug resistances. Surgery is suggested for persistent positive cases with localized lesions and a good cardiopulmonary reserve. The quinolone, ofloxacin, is a promising drug for MDR-TB, achieving a sputum conversion rate of 59-79%. A prospective study showed a success rate of 67% with no adverse effects. The current Bangkok multicenter trials on ofloxacin 600 mg daily combined with pyrazinamide, p-aminosalicylate, amikacin and ethambutol are ongoing. Good organization of ambulatory TB management combined with directly observed therapy will probably help to reduce the incidence of MDR-TB.

Although there has been an increase in the incidence of TB in HIV-infected cases, the percentage of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) in this group is the same as in the HIV-negative group (2.7%). The multidrug-resistant (MDR) rate in 1988 was nearly 2% in Thailand, increasing to 5% in 1994. The factors that promote MDRTB in Thailand include irregular drug taking, high initial drug resistance, the prescription of inappropriate regimens, and drug intolerance. The percentages of total initial drug resistance, four-drug resistance, and MDRTB have increased to 22.4%, 1.4%, and 4.8%, respectively. Comparable figures for acquired resistance are up to 2.5-, 10-, and 6-fold, respectively. Duration of treatment for 24-30 months depends on severity, previous therapy, and the number of drug resistances.

Quinolone and ofloxacin are promising drugs for MDRTB, achieving a sputum conversion rate of 59-79%. A prospective study showed a success rate of 67% with no adverse effects. However, when different regimens were examined, it was found that at least four anti-TB drugs are required. In current multicenter, controlled, prospective trials in Bangkok, 600 mg ofloxacin daily is combined with pyrazinamide, p-aminosalicylate, amikacin, and ethambutol, with a treatment duration of 18-24 months with a 2-year follow-up. No adverse effects were reported for the ofloxacin 300 mg/day regimen in several studies done.

8592990,Can penicillins and other beta-lactam antibiotics be used to treat tuberculosis?,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"An increase in the number of tuberculosis cases caused by multiple-drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has stimulated search for new antituberculous agents. Beta-lactam antibiotics, traditionally regarded as ineffective against tuberculosis, merit consideration. Four major penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with approximate molecular sizes of 94, 82, 52, and 37 kDa were detected by fluorography of [3H]penicillin-radiolabeled membrane proteins prepared from M. tuberculosis H37Ra. The presence of membrane-associated beta-lactamase precluded the use of membranes for assaying the binding affinities of beta-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, ampicillin affinity chromatography was used to purify these four PBPs from crude membranes in order to assay the binding affinities of beta-lactam antibiotics. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, and imipenem, beta-lactam antibiotics previously reported to be active in vitro against M. tuberculosis, bound to M. tuberculosis PBPs at therapeutically achievable concentrations. Binding of the 94-, 82-, and 52-kDa PBPs, but not the 37-kDa PBP, was associated with antibacterial activity, suggesting that these PBPs are the critical targets. Studies of mycobacterial cell wall permeability, which was assayed with a panel of reference cephalosporins and penicillins with different charge positivities, indicated that the rate of penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics to the target PBPs could not account for resistance. Resistance could be reversed with the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate or sulbactam or could be circumvented by the use of a beta-lactamase-stable drug, imipenem, indicating that mycobacterial beta-lactamase, probably in conjunction with slow penetration, is a major determinant of M. tuberculosis resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. These findings confirm in vitro data that M. tuberculosis is susceptible to some beta-lactam antibiotics. Further evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis in animal models and in clinical trials is warranted.",,,,1995-12-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

The results were as follows. (1) Most patients with drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis were middle-aged or past middle-aged. (2) There were many cases of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in previously treated tuberculosis patients with active disease and several cases in previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients. However, in some previously untreated patients active tuberculosis was convert relatively easily to inactive tuberculosis. (3) Concerning life style, bachelors who drank heavily were more likely to develop drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.

We therefore conducted a pilot study of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhuIL-2) as an adjunct to multidrug therapy (MDT) to evaluate the safety of this approach and to determine whether IL-2 can enhance the cellular immune response in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients included in this study presented with a wide range of extent and duration of infection, and were grouped into three categories for data analysis: (1) patients with newly diagnosed, acute-stage TB who were just beginning MDT; (2) patients who had received a minimum of 45 days MDT before the start of the study and who had responded to treatment; and (3) patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB who had been on MDT for at least seven months without apparent beneficial clinical response. Twenty patients received 30 days of twice-daily intradermal injections of 12.5 micrograms of IL-2. Patients from all three groups showed improvement of clinical symptoms over the 30-day period of treatment with IL-2 and MDT. Results of direct smear for acid fast bacilli (AFB) demonstrated conversion to sputum-negative following IL-2 and MDT treatment in all newly diagnosed patients and in 5/7 MDR TB patients. (The size of the skin test response to purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin increased during the 30-day IL-2 adjunctive therapy in newly diagnosed patients, but decreased or disappeared in the other two groups of treated patients.) Assays in vitro for phenotype distribution, natural killer (NK) cell activity, frequency of cells proliferating in response to exogenous IL-2, and antigen-induced blastogenesis demonstrated systemic responses to intradermally administered rhuIL-2. Levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IFN-gamma mRNA and IFN-gamma mRNA in biopsy of site of skin test response to purified protein derivative (PPD) were highest in those patients with the most acute symptoms at the beginning of the study, and decreased during rhuIL-2 and MDT. IL-2 immunotherapy did not modify levels of mRNA expression for other cytokines. Patients receiving IL-2 did not experience clinical deterioration or significant side effects.

7560968,Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,,The Journal of hospital infection,"Recent outbreaks of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. The poor outcomes are attributable to delayed diagnoses, slow reporting of antimycobacterial susceptibility results, inadequate treatment regimens and profound immunosuppression. There are no prospective clinical trials which have evaluated the optimal treatment of MDR-TB. A retrospective study has shown that in immunocompetent patients with secondary MDR-TB, only 56% responded to prolonged courses of multiple drug regimens, and 22% died of TB. In patients with AIDS, even fewer patients respond, with median survivals of 2-4 months. In general, better responses have been associated with in vitro susceptibility of patients' isolates. If possible, patients with MDR-TB should receive at least three drugs to which their isolates are susceptible for at least 24 months; these regimens are likely to include ethambutol, pyrazinamide, a quinolone, and an aminoglycoside. Selected patients benefit from surgical intervention combined with aggressive chemotherapy. MDR-TB is best prevented by directly observed therapy of patients with susceptible organisms and rigorous infection control practices in areas of high incidence of MDR-TB.

Rifabutin has been investigated in studies conducted in various countries around the world, and in the treatment of tuberculosis rifabutin in combination regimen has been shown to be as effective as rifampicin. Rifabutin is active in approximately 30% of patients with tuberculosis resistant to standard therapies, including rifampicin and/or isoniazid. Placebo-controlled studies of rifabutin in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection in AIDS patients have provided evidence for the inclusion of rifabutin in multidrug regimens.

7719114,Overview of toxicological data on rifabutin.,,Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie,"Rifabutin is a wide spectrum antibiotic particularly active on atypical and rifampicin-resistant mycobacteria. Rifabutin is more potent than rifampicin on Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro. Its mode of action is characterized by a high intracellular penetration in treated individuals. Clinical trials have proven the therapeutic value of rifabutin especially in AIDS patients with concomitant MAC. The preclinical safety evaluation of this compound included single and repeated dose toxicity studies of up to one year in rodents and non-rodents, reproduction and carcinogenicity studies and mutagenicity tests. During toxicological studies the most significant finding after repeated administration of rifabutin was the presence of multinucleated hepatocytes (MNH) in rats. This is a species specific finding which did not affect the life span of the hepatocytes. As shown in carcinogenicity studies, there was no tendency to further proliferative changes. Another specific histological feature among the species studied was the presence of a lipofuscin-like brown pigment, which was seen in many organs. This is a common finding with amphipilic compounds, such as rifabutin, which bind lipids and proteins, forming membrane-bound complexes. Even in carcinogenicity studies this change did not constitute a stimulus to cell proliferation and did not cause any secondary changes. In rodents, there was a mild hemolytic anemia at doses higher than 10 mg/kg/day. At doses ranging from 160-200 mg/kg/day rifabutin inhibited the functions of the male gonads in rats. This effect was reflected in a reduction of implantations observed in the fertility studies. Doses of 40 mg/kg/day did not induce any embryotoxic effects or changes in reproductive performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,1995-01-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

We prospectively evaluated 89 patients with tuberculosis and HIV infection at an urban medical center. Eighty-two patients received isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, with or without ethambutol, for 2 mo, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 7 mo. Seven patients received other regimens because of drug resistance or intolerance. Therapy was self-administered in 57 patients and directly observed in 32 cases. All patients showed rapid clinical improvement during the first month of therapy, and sputum cultures reverted to negative after 3 mo in 52 of 54 patients from whom specimens were obtained. Adverse reactions to isoniazid or rifampin prompted alterations in antituberculosis regimens in five patients (6%). Forty patients (45%) died during follow-up, and tuberculosis was a potential contributory cause of death in three cases. Treatment failure occurred in five patients (6%), four of whom were noncompliant with therapy. The fifty patient had an isoniazid-resistant organism. No relapses occurred in 916 patient-months of follow-up posttreatment. We thus conclude that the 9-mo regimen used for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients is effective and well tolerated.",,,,1994-12-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Among them, 190 patients, who were younger than 80 years old and had pulmonary tuberculosis with cavities or infiltration of extension 2 or 3, and/or were sputum-smear positive, had been treated by 6-month short course regimen containing pyrazinamide, 2HRS(E)Z/4HRE. And were eligible for the evaluation of the clinical usefulness of pyrazinamide-containing regimen for the initial treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The dose of pyrazinamide was 1.2 g per day irrespective of body weight. The patients of this treatment group consisted of 151 males and 39 females, and mean age of the males was 45.3 and that of the females was 43.8 years old. At the start of the treatment, 74% of the cases were smear positive, 70% were cavitary, and 6 cases each showed primary resistance to isoniazid and to streptomycin, respectively, and only one case showed resistance to both of isoniazid and streptomycin. There was no primary resistant case to either rifampicin or ethambutol. Bacteriologic negative conversion rates were 95% and 90% after 2 months of treatment by PZA-containing regimen and by the standard regimen, respectively, and treatment durations required to achieve the negative conversion of all cases were 3 and 6 months for respective regimens. Of 90 patients who completed 6-month PZA-containing regimen and could be followed-up, only one bacteriologic relapse (1.1%) was noticed. Elevation of serum GPT level higher than 150 IU/ml during the treatment was noticed in 6.3% of 175 cases under PZA-containing regimen in comparison with 4.0% of 174 cases under the standard regimen (not significant). The interval between the onset of the treatment and the detection of abnormal liver function was much shorter (mean 31.3 days) in the PZA-containing regimen than in the standard regimens (mean 63.4 days). Hyperuricaemia (> 10 mg/ml) was noticed in 46.7% of 57 males and 59.4% of 19 females tested, but pyrazinamide was not discontinued in any case due to arthralgia. These results clearly show that pyrazinamide can be used rather safely for Japanese tuberculosis patients. If the pyrazinamide-containing regimen [2HRS(E)Z/4HRE] is adopted as the new standard regimen in place of on-going standard regimen in Japan, 6HRS(E)/3HR, the duration of chemotherapy could be shortened by three months with the same level of both efficacy and safety. We recommended pyrazinamide-containing 6-month regimen, 2HRS(E)Z/4HRE, as the new standard regimen for the initial treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.",,,,1994-11-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
7848544,Clinically significant drug interactions with antituberculosis agents.,,Drug safety,"Standard short-course regimens for tuberculosis are used worldwide with very few problems. Unfortunately, the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis in many parts of the world is leading to a diversification of drug regimens and to the use of drugs that are more toxic per se and more likely to interact with others. In addition, the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients with tuberculosis or disease due to Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection with new drugs and multidrug regimens has added to the problem of drug interactions, especially as such patients may often be receiving concomitant treatment for a range of bacterial, fungal and viral infections. In general, there are very few clinically significant interactions between the first-line antituberculosis drugs themselves, although problems of bioavailability, notably of rifampicin (rifampin), have been encountered in the manufacture of combination tablets. Of the first-line drugs used to treat tuberculosis, i.e. rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide, rifampicin is particularly likely to cause clinically significant drug interactions as it is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme group, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, in particular oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, oral anticoagulants and cyclosproin. The use of quinolones to treat multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis and AIDS-related MAC disease raises further problems of drug interactions as, in contrast to rifampicin, these drugs inhibit some cytochrome isoenzymes, leading to reduced metabolism of certain drugs.",,,,1994-10-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Of great alarm is the findings of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) with outbreaks in hospitals throughout the world, as well as in other institutions. No health care worker is immune from exposure to TB. TB control requires education of health care workers, a program of ongoing screening, isolation of patients early in the course of their disease, and administration of multiple anti-TB drug to cover and treat MDR-TB.

Diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.
Prevention of infection and diagnosis and cure of TB.
The evidence was gathered in late 1992 from previous guidelines, recommendations by specialist societies and new studies.
Evidence was categorized into four levels: I, randomized clinical trials of therapeutic interventions or prospective studies of diagnostic strategies; II, case-control studies; III, retrospective descriptive studies; and IV, consensus of the committee members and published statements. The Tuberculosis Committee of the Canadian Thoracic Society comprises experts in TB from across Canada.
The benefits of early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy are well documented. The cost effectiveness of antituberculous therapy in developing countries is well documented. In developed countries chemoprophylaxis has been shown to be cost effective, and directly observed chemotherapy has recently been hypothesized to have economic benefits.
In the appropriate clinical setting, particularly when patients are known to be at high risk of TB, clinicians should consider TB, reserve body secretions for mycobacteriologic tests and conduct other investigations such as chest radiography. Furthermore, if TB is strongly suspected or confirmed by appropriate investigation the early initiation of multi-drug therapy, including at least three first-line drugs, is strongly recommended. If drug resistance is suspected a regimen of four to five drugs, including at least two drugs with which the patient has not been treated, should be started. If the strain is found to be resistant to any of the drugs in the regimen appropriate changes should be made. Chemoprophylaxis should be considered especially in contacts with a recent significant reaction to the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test and in people known to be at risk of reactivated TB infection, particularly those with HIV infection and a significant PPD skin-test result. Vaccination with bacillus Calmette-Guérin should be limited to high-risk groups, particularly aboriginal Canadians living on reserves.
These recommendations are based on a consensus of Canadian experts supported by other specialist societies and reference groups. They have been reviewed by the Standards Committee of the Canadian Thoracic Society.

Here, I described the present situations of new antituberculous agents, in particular new rifamycin derivatives including rifabutin and benzoxazinorifamycin (KRM-1648), new macrolides such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, and new quinolones including sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, AM-1155 and so on. Their in vitro antimycobacterial activities, therapeutic efficacy against experimental infections induced in animals especially in mice, and clinical trials using these drugs are summarized by referring to recent studies by worldwide investigators including us. Moreover, this paper dealt with some of recent attempts for chemotherapy of mycobacterial infections employing the drug delivery system using liposomal microvesicles as a carrier of drugs. Although these new drugs and development in new regimens appreciably potentiated the efficacy of controlling mycobacterial infections, in particular M. avium complex infections, it remains very difficult to achieve a complete elimination of the organisms from the sites of infection, even if provided multi-drug regimens using new drugs having excellent antimycobacterial activity and sufficient dosages.

Hong Kong Chest Service/British Medical Research Council.",,Tubercle and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,"A study of rifabutin in the retreatment of patients with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis whose strains of tubercle bacilli were resistant to all three of the drugs isoniazid, streptomycin, and rifampicin, and usually to others as well, was undertaken in 22 Chinese patients in Hong Kong. They were arranged in 11 pairs such that the resistance pattern of the strains for both patients was the same or closely similar. One of each pair was allocated at random to receive rifabutin (B) daily and the other rifampicin (R) daily. The two members of each pair were also prescribed the same or similar companion drugs, selected on the basis of the results of susceptibility tests and of the history of previous antituberculosis chemotherapy. The bacteriological results showed no evidence of a sustained benefit in any patient. A temporary response was seen on sputum smear examination in 14 patients (7B, 7R), of whom 10 (5B, 5R) had a period of smear-negativity, and on sputum culture examination in 10 patients (5B, 5R), of whom 3 (2B, 1R) had a period of culture-negativity. The duration of response was longer for the B patient in 5 pairs and for the R patient in 5. Two patients (both B) had rifabutin-susceptible strains on admission to the study; their temporary responses were among the best and were associated with the emergence of rifabutin resistance, suggesting that rifabutin may have contributed to their response. A total of 17 patients, including 7 not in the paired comparison, were subsequently retreated with ofloxacin; 10 showed a response, disease becoming and remaining quiescent in 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,1992-02-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
1731596,"A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of three antituberculosis chemoprophylaxis regimens in patients with silicosis in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Chest Service/Tuberculosis Research Centre, Madras/British Medical Research Council.",,The American review of respiratory disease,"A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of antituberculosis chemoprophylaxis was undertaken in sillicotic subjects in Hong Kong where there is a high prevalence of both silicosis and tuberculosis. During 1981 to 1987, 679 Chinese men with silicosis, with no history of previous antituberculosis chemotherapy and no evidence of active tuberculosis, were admitted to the trial and have been studied for between 2 and 5 yr. They were allocated at random to four series-rifampin for 12 wk (R3), isoniazid and rifampin for 12 wk (HR3), isoniazid alone for 24 wk (H6), or placebo (Pl)--in a double-blind design with matching placebos for isoniazid and rifampin as appropriate. Active pulmonary tuberculosis developed more frequently during the 5 yr in the placebo series than in the three chemoprophylaxis series (p less than 0.01, log-rank test), but there were no significant differences between the chemoprophylaxis series. The estimated proportions of patients with active pulmonary disease in the placebo series were 9% at 2 yr, 15% at 3 yr, 20% at 4 yr, and 27% at 5 yr. In contrast, in the three chemoprophylaxis series combined they were 5, 8, 10, and 13%, respectively. Thus, although chemoprophylaxis halved the proportion of patients in whom tuberculosis developed, this proportion was still substantial. There was no evidence that chemoprophylaxis led to the selection of drug-resistant strains of bacilli. Adverse effects were reported with a similar frequency in all four series, suggesting that few were drug related. During the first 12 wk, hepatic toxicity was reported in 8 (1%) patients (3 HR3, 3 H6, and 2 Pl), but only 1 (H6) had symptomatic hepatitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,1992-01-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
1949222,Short-course chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis under routine programme conditions: a comparison of regimens of 28 and 36 weeks duration in Algeria. Algerian Working Group/British Medical Research Council Cooperative Study.,,Tubercle,"Two chemotherapy regimens of 28 weeks (6M) and 36 weeks (8M) duration were compared in patients with previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in 30 health districts of Algeria. In the 6M regimen, patients received isoniazid plus rifampicin daily throughout with streptomycin and pyrazinamide in addition for the first 8 weeks. In the 8M regimen patients received isoniazid daily throughout plus rifampicin for the first 16 weeks and streptomycin and pyrazinamide as well for the first 8 weeks. The districts were allocated to apply either the 6M or the 8M regimen to all eligible patients. However, 22% of eligible patients were not admitted, the most common reason being oversight on the part of the personnel in the local health centres. A total of 2218 (977 6M, 1241 8M) patients was admitted and the results were assessed 2 years after the due date of completion of chemotherapy, irrespective of whether or not management had deviated from the study protocol. An appreciable proportion of patients (25% of 6M, 29% of 8M) could not be assessed because they failed to attend for follow-up or the collection of specimens was overlooked or because of difficulties in the transport of specimens to the reference laboratory in Algiers, and a further 5% and 4% of patients died. Of those who were assessable 7 (1%) of 731 6M and 15 (2%) of 875 8M were classified as having an unfavourable response during or after chemotherapy because they had one or more positive cultures. In addition 16 (2%) 6M and 18 (2%) 8M patients had received additional chemotherapy for failure, relapse or the development of non-pulmonary lesions but had achieved a favourable status. Of 1018 (488 6M, 530 8M) patients assessed who had fully sensitive strains pretreatment and completed treatment as planned, 97% in both series had a favourable status 2 years after their chemotherapy was due to be completed. In patients with initial strains resistant to isoniazid the results were less good in the 8M than the 6M series: none of the 19 6M compared with 5 of 26 in the 8M series having an unfavourable outcome suggesting that the duration of rifampicin may have been important in patients with initial isoniazid resistance. A slightly higher proportion of patients on the 8M regimen defaulted during chemotherapy (9.3% compared with 6.7% in the 6M regimen) but there was no difference between the regimens in other measures of compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,1991-06-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Chest DIsease Cooperative Study Unit of National Sanatoriums in Kinki District].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"Ofloxacin, a synthetic antibacterial pyridone-carboxylic acid derivative, was used in the treatment of intractable pulmonary tuberculosis. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Ofloxacin on pulmonary tuberculosis and Ofloxacin resistance were analyzed. All patients had been hospitalized in eight national sanatoria in Kinki district, and were excreting tubercle bacilli resistant to various anti-tuberculosis drugs agents. Ofloxacin was given to 118 patients orally at a daily dose of 300 mg to 600 mg for more than 3 months. A few anti-tuberculosis drugs, which had failed in the negative conversion of bacilli previously, were used in combination. By Ofloxacin, 23 patients (19.5%) showed negative conversion of tubercle bacilli in sputum culture within 5 months, and they remained culture-negative for at least 6 months after conversion. Side-effects were observed in 2 patients. One complained of arthralgia and the other felt abdominal fullness. But both were not serious. From these results, it was concluded that Ofloxacin was effective for intractable pulmonary tuberculosis.

1709600,Comparative efficacy of drug regimens in skin tuberculosis.,,Clinical and experimental dermatology,"Three antituberculous drug regimens have been employed to study the therapeutic response in 90 patients with any one of the commonly encountered paucibacillary forms of skin tuberculosis, namely lupus vulgaris, tuberculosis verrucosa cutis and scrofuloderma. The first two regimens contained rifampicin, isoniazid and either pyrazinamide or thiacetazone, and the third regimen had rifampicin and isoniazid only. The disease was clinically defined as localized when confined to one area and widespread when the lesions were disseminated. The observations revealed that the response of lupus vulgaris and tuberculosis verrucosa cutis was alike in all the three regimens, with the localized lesions subsiding completely after 4 months of therapy and the more extensive forms taking 5 months. Patients with scrofuloderma responded similarly to both the triple drug regimens. The discharge, sinuses and ulcers cleared in 6 months but the lymph nodes took longer to regress, up to 7 months in localized and 9 months in more widespread scrofuloderma. To obtain the same results with rifampicin and isoniazid, all patients with widespread scrofuloderma and one-third of those with localized forms had to be treated for 10 and 9 months, respectively. No serious drug side-effects, apart from giddiness with rifampicin and acneiform eruptions with thiacetazone, were encountered. No instances of relapse were noted in the 50% of patients who were followed-up for 3 1/2 years after therapy. Single-drug therapy with isoniazid for lupus vulgaris, as given in the past, is to be discouraged as it may promote the emergence of drug-resistant bacilli in those with an undetected focus of infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,1991-03-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Clinical evaluation was made in 132 patients and efficacy rates of SBTPC were 80.0% (28/35) for pneumonia, 78.5% (73/93) for bronchitis and 100% for the remaining 1 patient with other respiratory tract infections. The overall efficacy rate was 79.1% (102/129). 2. Clinical efficacy rate of SBTPC for respiratory tract infections in patients with underlying diseases such as chronic bronchitis, old pulmonary tuberculosis etc., was 75.0% (60/80) which was not significantly different from the efficacy rate of 85.7% (42/49) in patients without underlying diseases. 3. Of 13 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic treatments, 8 (61.5%) were effectively treated with SBTPC. 4. Clinical efficacy rates against infections caused by single species of organisms were 90.9% (10/11) for Haemophilus influenzae, 100% (8/8) for Streptococcus viridans and 100% (3/3) for Staphylococcus aureus.

Church-affiliated lay workers obtained 1,990 sputum specimens from subjects who complained of chronic cough or wasting symptoms; 207 of the specimens were positive on Ziehl-Neelsen smears. On culture, 176 yielded a significant growth of M. tuberculosis. Of these 176 patients, 144 were selected to enter the study; 10 were lost because of withdrawal or death and four (2.7%) because of drug toxicity. This left 130 patients who were followed long-term. Remarkably, 80% (104) were initially shedding drug-resistant organisms; 26% (34) were resistant to one drug, 30% (40) were resistant to two drugs, and 24% (30) were resistant to three or more drugs. Responses to therapy corresponded closely to the extent of drug resistance: 80% (48 of 60) of patients with drug-susceptible or single resistance had a favorable outcome; 43% (28 of 65) were resistant to two or three drugs, and 0% (0 of 5) of those were resistant to four or more drugs. Notable findings of this study were the success of a community-based program in conducting prolonged, directly observed treatment, the unexpectedly high prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant organisms in this population, and the inadequacy of INH + PZA + EMB during the continuation phase of therapy in this setting.",,,,1990-12-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

2232438,[Clinical immunology of tuberculosis].,,Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis],"The standard tuberculin skin test has been known as the prototype of delayed type hypersensitivity testing which is mediated by T cells and macrophages and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is indeed a chronic infectious disease, but variation in the host immune responses to tubercle bacilli results in the various clinical manifestations of the disease ranging from an immunologically hyperreactive state observed in pleural fluid lymphocytes in tuberculous pleurisy to an almost totally unresponsive state observed in those severely ill with refractory tuberculosis. In tuberculous pleurisy, T cells in pleural fluid respond remarkably in vitro to PPD tuberculin whereas T cells in peripheral blood responded poorly to PPD stimulation. Compartmentalization of PPD-reactive T cells in the pleural fluid and immunosuppression by T cells and/or macrophages in the peripheral blood were responsible for this immunological difference observed between the lymphocytes in pleural fluid and those in peripheral blood of tuberculous pleurisy. In advanced, drug-resistant tuberculosis as well as in nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, the proliferative responses of T cells in vitro to PPD stimulation were impaired. This depressed T cell response was due to depressed interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and not due to depressed IL-2 responsiveness. Therefore, the addition of exogenous IL-2, returned the depressed PPD-induced lymphocyte proliferation in vitro in these patients to the level of the response observed in lymphocytes from patients with newly-diagnosed tuberculosis. Our results suggest that recombinant IL-2 offers a novel approach to the therapy of advanced, drug-resistant tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Preliminary clinical trials of immunotherapy with recombinant IL-2 reveals the effectiveness of this therapy and encourages us to extend the trial to a larger scale. Tubercle bacilli have various biological activities. Research on tuberculosis and tubercle bacilli have contributed much to the progress of biochemistry, pathology and immunology. Mycobacterium is a fascinating organism, which now presents another big appeal to those studying immunology: Study of immunological interaction between gamma delta T cells and the highly conserved protein in mycobacteria, HSP, heat shock protein will contribute to the elucidation of the mechanism of immunological surveillance and the mechanism of autoimmune diseases. In addition, it will also contribute to the development of a new mycobacterial vaccine which will give direct, protective immunity against tuberculosis.",,,,1990-09-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
1699337,An investigation of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Kuwait in preparation for studies of immunotherapy with Mycobacterium vaccae.,,Tubercle,"Sixty-five patients, many of them immigrant to Kuwait, with bacteriologically proven, adult type, pulmonary tuberculosis were studied by many parameters over the 4 months following diagnosis. Twelve were infected with tubercle bacilli resistant to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug. Preliminary evidence suggested that this was frequently primary resistance in patients infected in their countries of origin. The Kuwaiti environment results in very high skin test and lymphocyte proliferative responses (LTT) to shared and species specific antigens of mycobacteria in healthy persons. In comparison, patients with tuberculosis lacked cellular responses to group i and group ii antigens, but had increased IgG and IgA binding to mycobacterial antigens in general. LTT responses to added interleukin 2, and production of alpha interferon, were normal in our patients, but induction of gamma interferon in response to phytohaemagglutinin was reduced initially, rising towards normal during treatment. Biochemical and haematological abnormalities present at the time of diagnosis rapidly corrected. The disease differed from that reported in most previous studies in that fever was uncommon, the disease was never fatal, and most tuberculin tests were not necrotising. This implied that a detrimental immunopathological component is less pronounced in those exposed to the Kuwaiti environment, and a hypothesis is put forward to explain this.",,,,1990-06-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

Non-compliance was detected in 42% of the RHZ group and in 16% of the RHZS group. Two patients in the RHZ group and 4 in the RHZS group had to have their treatment altered because routine investigations revealed drug-resistant mycobacteria. Treatment was unsuccessful in 10 patients in the RHZ group, with 4 men failing to complete the regimen and being lost to follow-up, 3 cases of failure of conversion of sputum on the regimen, and 3 relapses. The results for the RHZS group were similar, with 4 failures to complete the regimen, 2 treatment failures and 4 relapses. Evaluation of RHZ showed it to be comparable with a previously evaluated, successful short-course regimen (RHZS).

2461162,MIC as a quantitative measurement of the susceptibility of Mycobacterium avium strains to seven antituberculosis drugs.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"MICs of isoniazid, rifampin, ethionamide, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin were determined for Mycobacterium avium complex strains by two methods: broth dilution in 7H12 medium radiometrically and agar dilution on 7H10 agar plates. The broth-determined MICs of all drugs with the exception of isoniazid were two to eight times lower than the agar-determined MICs for most of the tested M. avium strains, which is probably due to the higher absorption and degradation of the drugs in solid media. The MICs, especially those determined in broth, are suggested as quantitative measurements of the degree of susceptibility of M. avium complex strains. For a certain percentage of the M. avium strains the broth-determined MICs were within the limits of MICs found for wild susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. These M. avium strains were classified as presumably susceptible. In contrast to M. tuberculosis, the MICs for M. avium strains had a wide range. When the MICs for M. avium strains were only one dilution higher than those for M. tuberculosis, they were tentatively classified as moderately susceptible. The designation moderately resistant or resistant, respectively, is suggested for those M. avium strains for which the MICs were at or above the concentrations achievable in blood. The quantitation of the degree of susceptibility by the MICs and the tentative interpretation of the MICs are suggested for future use in clinical trials as a means of evaluating the patients' responses to chemotherapy compared with the degree of susceptibility of the initial strain isolated before treatment.",,,,1988-08-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

In animal models, the drug is more active against both Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae than in rifampin, and studies indicate that rifabutin is active against some rifampin-resistant strains of both species. The drug has a long half-life (16 hr) in humans and a marked tissue tropism, with tissue levels five- to 10-fold higher than that in the serum. In animals rifabutin is no more toxic than rifampin. A large experience from the compassionate use of rifabutin for life-threatening mycobacterial infections in humans, most commonly disseminated M. avium complex disease in patients with AIDS, has also indicated relative drug safety. Although some data suggest that rifabutin is effective, firm conclusions about drug efficacy await results from controlled clinical trials.",,,,1987-05-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

6418368,Short-course chemotherapy for mycobacteriosis kansasii?,,Canadian Medical Association journal,"The success of short-course chemotherapy for tuberculosis, the similarity between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. kansasii and the effectiveness of rifampin against the latter organism prompted a comparison of the diseases due to these organisms to assess the feasibility of a prospective trial of short-course chemotherapy in patients with mycobacteriosis kansasii. The two groups of patients were matched for age, sex and time of diagnosis. The patients with mycobacteriosis kansasii more frequently had underlying obstructive pulmonary disease. The clinical course of mycobacteriosis kansasii was more indolent, with a slower rate of improvement according to the chest x-ray films and a longer time before sputum smears and cultures became negative. M. kansasii was significantly more resistant to all the antibiotics, including rifampin. Although these differences from tuberculosis suggest that an equally short course of therapy may not be effective for patients with mycobacteriosis kansasii, the outcome was good in compliant patients who were given the three most effective major drugs for 12 months after the sputum smears and cultures had become negative. Therefore, a trial of modified short-course chemotherapy is recommended for patients with mycobacteriosis kansasii.",,,,1984-01-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

All four had the same initial 2-month intensive phase of streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide (SHRZ). The continuation phase of the 6-month regimens was: 1) isoniazid and rifampicin (4HR), or 2) isoniazid and pyrazinamide (4HZ), or 3) isoniazid alone (4H) and of the 8-month regimen 4) isoniazid alone (6H). All patients have been followed up for 12 months after stopping chemotherapy. In patients with fully sensitive strains pretreatment the 6-month regimen with rifampicin throughout (4 HR) was highly effective with a bacteriological relapse rate of 2% of 167 patients, significantly better (P less than 0.01) than the rate of 9% of 158 patients in the 6-month regimen with isoniazid alone in the continuation phase (4H). The 8-month regimen (6H) was also highly effective, with a relapse rate of 3% of 119 patients but was not significantly better (p greater than 0.1) than the 6-month isoniazid regimen (4H). The regimen with pyrazinamide throughout (4HZ) had a relapse rate of 4% of 165 patients, not significantly different from any of the other regimens. An important finding in the two regimens with isoniazid alone in the continuation phase (4H and 6H) was that 1 of the 2 failures during chemotherapy and 17 of the 18 bacteriological relapses after stopping occurred with strains still sensitive to isoniazid. In patients with strains resistant to isoniazid pretreatment, 8 of 19 patients on the 4H or 6H regimens had an unfavourable response during chemotherapy compared with none of 26 on the HR or HZ regimens (P less than 0.005).

The drugs must be given in combination to avoid the emergence of resistant organisms. The simplest regimen is based on the administration of isoniazid and rifampin for 9 months. Ethambutol or streptomycin generally is added for an initial 2-8 weeks. Good results also have been reported using twice weekly administration of the isoniazid and rifampin after an initial 1 month of daily treatment. Relapse rates of less than 3% have been reported with these regimens. A table shows the recommended doses for the drugs. If neither isoniazid nor rifampin can be used, the patient needs to be given at least 2 and preferably 3 drugs to which his organisms are known to be susceptible. Additionally, these drugs must be administered for at least 18 months. Several circumstances are associated with a higher rate of drug resistant organisms and call for susceptibility studies: tuberculosis among individuals known to have a higher prevalence of drug resistance such as Asians or Hispanics; previous treatment; persistence of culture-positive sputum after 3 months of therapy; and exposure to drug resistant tuberculosis. The recommendations for the treatment regimen need to be changed in several special situations, including: infection with mycobacteria other than ""M. tuberculosis;"" tuberculosis in children; disease in organ systems other than the lungs; and the presence of certain patient characteristics, concurrent diseases, or the development of adverse drug reactions. Much scientific data supports the value of isoniazid (INH) in the prevention of tuberculosis. Isoniazid preventive therapy is recommended for several groups, listed in order of priority: household members and other close associates of potentially infectious tuberculosis cases; newly infected persons; persons with significant reactions to tuberculin skin test and abnormal chest roentgenograms; persons with significant reactions to tuberculin skin tests who are in special clinical situations; and tuberculin skin test reactors under age 35 with none of the other risk factors. Prior to administration of INH preventive therapy, it is important to: exclude bacteriologically positive or progressive tuberculous disease; question for a history of prior INH administration to exclude those who have had a adequate course of the drug; check for contraindications to the administration of INH for preventive therapy; and identify patients for whom preventive therapy is not contraindicated but in whom special precautions are indicated.

6784621,Should isoniazid be used in retreatment of tuberculosis despite acquired isoniazid resistance?,,The American review of respiratory disease,"The use of high-dose isoniazid in retreatment regimens for tuberculosis, despite acquired isoniazid resistance, could possibly improve therapeutic results if all or part of the organisms were resistant to only low concentrations of that drug. Furthermore, organisms resistant to low concentrations of isoniazid have been shown, on occasion, to be resistant to 2 of the retreatment drugs, ethionamide and pyrazinamide, whereas higher degrees of isoniazid resistance are associated with susceptibility to these drugs. Use of high-dose isoniazid might improve results in retreatment with ethionamide and pyrazinamide by eliminating any organisms with low degrees of isoniazid resistance that have associated ethionamide and pyrazinamide resistance. Two clinical trials concerning this topic have been reported. A controlled retreatment trial with various combinations of ethionamide, cycloserine, and pyrazinamide with and without conventional ""low"" doses of isoniazid (300 mg per day) showed no benefit when isoniazid was added. However, a noncontrolled trial using ethionamide and pyrazinamide with and without high doses of isoniazid, 1 to 1.5 g per day, showed marked benefit with the added isoniazid. In view of these conflicting data, the use of high-dose isoniazid in retreatment regimens needs further study, which could probably be carried out in the developing countries.",,,,1981-03-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

6777920,Quality control in tuberculosis bacteriology. 2. The origin of isolated positive cultures from the sputum of patients in four studies of short course chemotherapy in Africa.,,Tubercle,"During intensive bacteriological follow-up of 2123 patients who had received short course chemotherapy regimens in 4 controlled clinical trials in Africa and had not had a bacteriological relapse, 405 isolated positive cultures were obtained from 37 429 sputum specimens in 3 East African laboratories. These cultures might have arisen as a result of clerical error, of transfer of bacilli from positive to negative specimens in the laboratory or from the lesions of the patients. Clerical error in the labelling of specimens or the recording of results did not seem a frequent cause, since isolated positive cultures contained many fewer colonies than cultures from other positive specimens being processed at the same time. Several of evidence suggested that some isolated positive cultures arose from the lesions of patients: a decrease in their incidence occurred in successive time periods after chemotherapy; the number of isolated positives per patient departed significantly from the Poisson distribution; they were more often drug resistant than other cultures processed at the time; positive cultures were obtained less frequently from known autoclaved specimens inserted among the the study specimens than from the study specimens themselves; no association was found between the incidence of isolated positive and of specimens containing numerous viable M. tuberculosis being processed at the same time. Nevertheless some of these cultures probably arose by transfer in the laboratory, since the rates at which transfer were known to occur differed in the 3 laboratories and corresponded to the rates of obtaining isolated positive cultures.",,,,1980-09-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
375787,Clinical trial of six-month and four-month regimens of chemotherapy in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.,,The American review of respiratory disease,"In a study in Singapore, Chinese, Malay, and Indian patients with pulmonary tuberculosis received 2 months of daily treatment with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide followed either by daily treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide (SHRZ/HRZ regimen) or by daily administration of isoniazid and rifampin (SHRZ/HR regimen) allocated at random. Both regimens were given for either 6 or 4 months by random allocation. All 330 patients with drug-sensitive tubercle bacilli before treatment had a favorable bacteriologic response during chemotherapy. During the first 6 months after the end of chemotherapy, there was only a single bacteriologic relapse among 84 SHRZ/HRZ and 80 SHRZ/HR patients treated for 6 months, but 8 (10 per cent) of 80 SHRZ/HRZ and 4 (5 per cent) of 74 SHRZ/HR patients treated for 4 months relapsed. Of a total of 33 patients with bacilli resistant to isoniazid, streptomycin, or both drugs before treatment, only one had an unfavorable response during chemotherapy, and none of 31 patients relapsed during the first 6 months after stopping chemotherapy. The incidence of adverse reactions was low; 11 (3 per cent) of 397 patients had hepatitis, but not all episodes were attributable to drug toxicity, and one patient had thrombocytopenic purpura.",,,,1979-04-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
100029,Controlled trial of 6-month and 8-month regimens in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. First report.,,The American review of respiratory disease,"Four short-course antituberculosis regimens allocated at random were studied; (1) streptomycin, isoniazid, and rifampin given daily for 6 months; (2) these 3 drugs plus pyrazinamide given daily for 2 months, followed by twice-weekly administration of streptomycin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide; (3) a regimen that differed from regimen 2 only in that ethambutol replaced pyrazinamide, and (4) streptomycin plus isoniazid plus rifampin plus pyrazinamide given 3 times per week for 4 months, followed by streptomycin plus isoniazid plus pyrazinamide administered twice per week. The last 3 regimens were given for 6 or 8 months at random. All except 1 of 680 patients with tubercle bacilli drug-susceptible before treatment had a favorable bacteriologic response during chemotherapy. The relapse rates during the first 6 months after chemotherapy were low, except in the ethambutol series, in which 19 per cent of the patients relapsed after 6 months of treatment, and 8 per cent relapsed after 8 months. A substantial proportion of the patients with strains initially resistant to either isoniazid or streptomycin had a favorable response to their allocated regimen, but the results were not as good for those patients with strains resistant to both drugs. An important finding is that the incidences of immunologic febrile reactions to rifampin and of rifampin-dependent antibodies were very low during the 3-times-weekly regimen.",,,,1978-08-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
60080,[Experimental and clinical study test of capreomycin].,,Antibiotiki,"Data on the experimental and clinical study of capreomycin in the treatment of tuberculosis are presented. It was shown that capreomycin had low activity with respect to the sensitive strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv in vitro and the respective infection caused by it in mice. The activity of capreomycin in vitro with respect to streptomycin resistant strains was the same as that with respect to the sensitive strains, while in vivo it increased 3 times. Capreomycin showed a tendency to decreasing its activity with respect to strains highely resistant to canamycin only in vitro. The effect of capreomycin on tuberculosis infection caused by strains resistant to different concentrations of canamycin was the same as that on tuberculosis infection caused by sensitive strains. Cross resistance between florimycin (viomycin) and capreomycin was shown. Clinical trails of capreomycin revealed its moderate therapeutic efficiency, relatively low toxicity and an allergenizing effect on the host. Transient ventibulopatia without pronounced signs of ototoxic action was observed. The nephrotoxic effect was moderate and transient. It was observed predominantly at the peak of the allergic reactions to the antitubercle drugs. The data obtained during the study allow recommendation of capreomycin use in clinics as reserve drug when the causative agent is not resistant to florimycin. The drug should be used under regular control of the blood picture, electrolyte metabolism, state of the kidneys, auditory and vestibular apparatus.",,,,1976-07-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv

822547,A comparative study of daily followed by twice- or once-weekly regimens of ethambutol and rifampicin in the retreatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: second report.,,Tubercle,"Three hundred and twenty-nine patients with isoniazid-resistant cultures, 66% with radiographically far advanced disease and 86% with cavities, have been treated with rifampicin and ethambutol and followed-up for 2 years after the end of treatment. The drugs were given daily for 12 weeks (600 mg rifampicin and 25 mg/kg ethambutol), thereafter once- or twice-weekly (600 or 1200 mg rifampicin and 50 mg/kg ethambutol) for a total of 12, 18 or 24 months (in the 600 mg group for 12 months only). With both 600 and 1200 mg rifampicin dosage the bacteriological results at the end of a year were similar (5% bacteriologically unfavourable in each group). Prolonging treatment to 18 or 24 months with the 1200 mg rifampicin dose had no effect on the bacteriological results. During the 2 years follow-up period after treatment stopped 6 patients had a bacteriological relapse. Of the 74 with a favourable status after 1 year in the 600 mg rifampicin group 5 (6.7%) relapsed, but only 1 (0.6%) of 168 in the 1200 mg groups treated for 12, 18 or 24 months (the duration of treatment did not appear to be related to relapse). Side-effects were reported more frequently with once-weekly dosage. They were more frequent with 1200 mg rifampicin than with 600 mg and with the former dose more frequent in the groups treated for longer than 1 year. With 12 months treatment with 600 mg rifampicin only 1% of patients had to have the regimen changed; with 1200 mg it was 9% and with this dose for 24 months 20%. With the lower dosage of rifampicin there were fewer failures due to toxicity but more failures due to relapse. Of 82 patients in the 600 mg regimen there were 12% unfavourable results (4 bacteriological failures, 5 relapses and 1 change of treatment for toxicity). Of 78 patients in the 1200 mg regimen there were 13% unfavourable results (3 bacteriological failures, no relapses and 7 changes of treatment for toxicity).",,,,1976-06-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
766340,A controlled trial of daily and intermittent rifampicin plus ethambutol in the retreatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: results up to 30 months.,,Tubercle,"In a controlled clinical trial in Hong Kong, 575 Chinese adults with smear-positive isoniazid-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, who had previously been treated with first-line chemotherapy, were allocated at random to regimens of rifampicin plus ethambutol daily (ER7), twice-weekly (ER2), once-weekly (ER1), or daily for 2 months and then once-weekly (ER7ER1), or to a standard retreatment regimen of daily ethionamide plus pyrazinamide plus cycloserine (EtZC). The ER7 patients were allocated to 12 or 18 months of chemotherapy, and the remainder to 18 months. As assessed at 18 months, a favourable response was achieved in 87 per cent of 91 ER7 patients, 79 per cent of 84 ER2, 81 per cent of 53 ER1, 87 per cent of 62 ER7ER1, and in 88 per cent of 68 EtZC patients (93 per cent of 59 EtZC patients if those with ethionamide-resistant strains pretreatment are excluded). As assessed at 18 and 30 months the ER7 regime was as effective as the control EtZC regimen, and 18 months of chemotherapy on the ER7 regimen conferred no benefit over 12 months. No patient on either regimen relapsed after 18 months. Adverse reactions were uncommon on the daily rifampicin regimen but relatively common on the intermittent and control regimens. The commonest reaction to the intermittent regimens was the 'flu' syndrome, which was associated with the presence of circulating rifampicin-dependent antibodies (P less than 0-001).",,,,1975-09-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
1103400,Controlled trial of 6- and 9-month regimens of daily and intermittent streptomycin plus isoniazid plus pyrazinamide for pulmonary tuberculosis in Hong Kong.,,Tubercle,"A comparison has been made between 6- and 9-month regimens of streptomycin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide given daily, 3 times a week or twice a week from the start of chemotherapy, in the treatment of newly-diagnosed, smear-positive, pulmonary tuberculosis in Chinese patients. At 6 months the twice-weekly regimen was marginally inferior in that 5 (4 per cent) of 126 patients with drug-sensitive strains pretreatment had an unfavourable bacteriological status compared with only 2 (1 per cent) of 141 on the 3 times weekly and none of 137 of the daily regimen. Of a total of 211 patients treated for 9 months, only 1 of 74 on the twice-weekly regimen relapsed bacteriologically between 6 and 9 months. The bacteriological relapse rates in the first 6 months of follow-up after 6 months' chemotherapy were 13 per cent on the daily, 16 per cent on the 3 times weekly, and 18 per cent on the twice-weekly regimen, and after 9 months' chemotherapy they were 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. All 33 relapses were with strains sensitive to isoniazid and streptomycin, and 76 per cent of them occurred in the first 3 months after the end of chemotherapy. Although patients with drug-resistant strains pretreatment fared less well, about two-thirds had a favourable bacteriological status at 6 months, and all 3 regimens given for 9 months had low relapse rates. The implications of these findings are discussed.",,,,1975-06-01,Pubmed_Drug_Resistant_Tuberculosis.csv
