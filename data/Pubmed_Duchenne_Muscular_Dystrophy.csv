40065476,Caregivers and multidisciplinary team members' perspectives on shared decision making in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A qualitative study.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Informational needs, Interprofessional model of shared decision making, Multidisciplinary team, Patient decision aids, Patient engagement",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,"As new therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are entering the market, shared decision making (SDM) will become increasingly important. Therefore, this study aimed to understand (1) Belgian stakeholders' knowledge and perceptions of SDM in DMD treatment decision making, (2) the current state of SDM implementation in DMD in Belgium, examining the role of all involved parties, and (3) the barriers and facilitators for SDM in DMD in the Belgian context.
In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews with the multidisciplinary team (MDT) of individuals with DMD (n = 18) and caregivers thereof (n = 11) were conducted in Belgium. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically using the framework method.
Most caregivers were unfamiliar with the term SDM, while MDT members were aware of it but struggled to define it consistent with existing literature. Despite acknowledging some drawbacks, participants valued SDM as an important process in DMD care, noting its presence in current practice. However, both MDT members and caregivers sometimes questioned the necessity of SDM due to limited treatment options available. Consequently, decision making predominantly relied on (child) neurologists sharing information and seeking consent from caregivers and individuals with DMD for a proposed treatment. Participants highlighted the important role of the MDT, with each professional contributing its unique expertise to SDM. To reduce existing barriers and enhance the SDM process, participants called for clear and transparent information regarding different treatment options, including clinical trials, and detailed information on how treatments might affect patients' daily life.
This study identified an increased need for easily understandable information, particularly regarding DMD care in general, but also about clinical trials covering new and emerging therapies. Developing specific evidence-based tools could support stakeholders' understanding of this information, thereby enhancing implementation of the SDM process in DMD care. Further, as the treatment landscape of DMD evolves, it will become increasingly important for patients to be supported by an MDT, as they can provide information on clinical trials (e.g., study coordinators), emotional support (e.g., psychologists, nurses), and decisional guidance (e.g., neurologist).",,"Most caregivers were unfamiliar with the term SDM, while MDT members were aware of it but struggled to define it consistent with existing literature.

40034011,A historical perspective on the development of antisense oligonucleotide treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy.,"RNA therapy, exon skipping, muscle, splice modulation",Journal of neuromuscular diseases,"Splice modulating antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have been approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (nusinersen) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (eteplirsen) since 2016. Nusinersen obtained full approval based on convincing functional evidence in treated patients. The treatment is currently approved in over 40 countries. By contrast, eteplirsen received accelerated approval and functional evidence from clinical trials that treatment slows down disease progression is still lacking. Approval and access is restricted to the USA and several countries in the Middle-East. In this historical perspective we look back to the development paths of these two ASOs focusing on the differences between the approaches, the target tissues and the diseases.

We analyzed 186 vamorolone trial participants with DMD (VBP15-002/003; VBP15-004) who were 4 to <7 years old and steroid-naïve at baseline. We stratified participants into gene variant classes by either variant location in the gene affecting different gene promoters (5' [Dp427-only] vs 3' [Dp427+other isoforms]) or residual dystrophin levels (null vs possible non-null [5' gene variants, exon 44 skippable, splice site]). We evaluated associations with baseline motor outcomes and treatment response (prednisone and vamorolone).
Participants with variants in ex63 and downstream (null for Dp427+Dp140+Dp71 protein isoforms) showed poorer baseline motor outcomes for time to stand from supine velocity than those with variants in ex1-44 (Dp427 only). No significant baseline differences were found between likely null and possible non-null variants. Participants with only Dp427 involvement showed significantly better treatment response for the 6-minute walk distance. Most of the comparisons of baseline motor function and treatment response were similar between variant classes.
The large variation in baseline motor function in young, steroid-naïve patients with DMD is only minimally explained by different gene variant classes. While there is strong literature support for 3' variants leading to a more severe motor and cognitive DMD phenotype, we found this variant class under-represented in our clinical trials. This suggests that they may fail inclusion criteria (failure to follow commands; poor motor function). Subgroup analyses in DMD clinical trials at a young age range based on gene variant class may not reveal significant differences and would be relatively noninformative.",,Participants with variants in ex63 and downstream (null for Dp427+Dp140+Dp71 protein isoforms) showed poorer baseline motor outcomes for time to stand from supine velocity than those with variants in ex1-44 (Dp427 only).

To understand the current DMD management standards and practices in Asia and to evaluate inconsistencies, unmet needs, and future directions for DMD patient management in the region.
Clinical experts from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan convened in September 2023 to discuss DMD diagnosis, assessment, treatment, and management best practices. A pre-meeting survey was also administered to explore professional perspectives and practices and refine the discussion focus.
Genetic profiling has become the pivotal diagnostic tool and has been universally adopted by experts. Steroid therapy is recognized as the cornerstone of DMD care. However, there are various opinions regarding the timing of its initiation and whether it should be continued after the loss of ambulation. Gene therapy has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in patients with DMD. However, its adoption is hampered by high costs, the potential for serious adverse events, and difficulties with patient selection.

This leads to progressive muscle wasting, cardiac and respiratory dysfunction, and premature death. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based therapies represent a promising approach to treating DMD, with several already approved by the FDA. However, the levels of dystrophin restoration achieved in clinical trials are often insufficient for meaningful therapeutic impact, highlighting the urgent need to enhance ASO efficacy. One potential strategy is to improve muscle pathophysiology, which is compromised in DMD due to cycles of necrosis and regeneration, chronic inflammation, and fibrotic and adipose tissue replacement.

39959935,JAG1 overexpression partially rescues muscle function in a zebrafish model of duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Journal of genetics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and loss of function due to the absence of dystrophin. In this study, we utilized a zebrafish model with a dmd gene knockout to explore the therapeutic potential of JAG1 overexpression in mitigating DMD-associated muscle dysfunction. Dystrophic zebrafish larvae displayed significant impairments in muscle function, evidenced by reduced swimming abilities, decreased birefringence, and disrupted β-dystroglycan localization, indicative of structural degeneration. Overexpression of JAG1, achieved via plasmid injection, partially restored muscle function, as reflected by improvements in stride length and total swimming distance. However, the structural integrity of slow oxidative muscle fibers remained largely unaffected, with a functional decline from 4 to 8 days post-fertilization (dpf) being more indicative of disease progression than structural changes. These findings suggest that the rescue effect of JAG1 overexpression may not be due to the preservation of slow oxidative fibers but rather through a mechanism that reduces susceptibility to contraction-induced injury. Notably, our study faced limitations related to the control of JAG1 expression levels and tissue specificity. Our results highlight the complexity of DMD pathology, where muscle structure and function do not always correlate, emphasizing the need for refined functional assays to better assess therapeutic outcomes. By incorporating functional recovery assessments at 8-10 dpf, zebrafish models can serve as more predictive preclinical tools, potentially enhancing the translational relevance of findings and reducing risks for patients in clinical trials. This study investigates how increasing the levels of a protein called JAG1 can help improve muscle function in a zebrafish model of DMD. By showing partial recovery of muscle activity, the findings suggest new therapeutic strategies that could potentially slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes.",,,,2025-02-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, the clinical outcome assessments used in the evaluation of patients with Duchenne and as endpoints in clinical trials require significant patient cooperation, which can be challenging in those with severe behavioral issues and leads to their exclusion. With ongoing expansion of the therapeutic arsenal, we aimed to explore differences in motor function test completion and measurements between Duchenne patients with and without autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a large tertiary care hospital's pediatric neuromuscular clinic. We identified significantly lower rates of motor function testing and motor function test scores among Duchenne patients with autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These findings underscore the need for adequate opportunity to complete motor function testing in those patients. Alternatively, the Duchenne community could consider validating more patient-reported outcomes and wearable device outcome measures in trials that families of children with neurodevelopmental disorders could more easily use. These interventions would improve equitable access to new therapies for patients with severe behavioral issues and allow researchers to track broader clinical outcomes among all patients as the Duchenne treatment landscape expands.",,,,2025-02-14,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

GC use has changed over time with evolving evidence, and we describe GC patterns, dosing and side-effects in the UK over 11 years.
NorthStar data from 2012 to 2022 were analysed to understand GC type, regime and starting age. GC dose with age, patterns of GC switching and side-effect profiles by type and regime were also analysed. Participants attributed to 'other' regimes were queried and details were included.
Data on GC usage were available for 1117 boys, across 6905 observations, with 74% of boys GC treated. Prednisolone was the most common regime in the period (65% of assessments) but deflazacort prescription has increased (17% in 2012 and 43% in 2022). Daily regimes were more common (66% of assessments), and the incidence of intermittent (10 days on/10 days off) regimes has declined (46% in 2012 and 26% in 2022). Older participants were more commonly on less than recommended doses, and this was more common in those on deflazacort or daily regimes. Gastrointestinal symptoms and cushingoid features were more common in those on deflazacort than prednisolone, while increased appetite, cushingoid features, gastrointestinal symptoms and insomnia were more common in those on daily than intermittent regimes.

There is also a need for clear recommendations to guide this process.
To establish international consensus guidelines regarding best practices for transitioning patients with DMD from paediatric to adult care and ensuring continuity of treatment.
Consensus statements were developed using the Delphi process and scored using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The initiative was led by a steering committee (one non-voting chair and two voting members) who recruited 15 expert panellists to form the consensus group. Following an initial systematic literature search, the consensus group voted in three voting rounds. Round 1 (free-text responses to questions) and Round 2 (importance ranking of statements) were completed using an online survey. Round 3 (voting on final consensus statements) took place during a virtual consensus meeting.
Consensus was reached on 48 statements covering the topics of transition planning, the transition process, post-transfer management, communicating with young people with DMD and supporting them with the transition to adult life.

Traditional methods for assessing neurological disorders rely on clinical scales and subjective measures. The snapshot of the disease progression at a particular time point, lack of cooperation by the children during assessments, and susceptibility to bias limit the utility of these measures. Wearable sensors, which capture data continuously in natural settings, offer a non-invasive and objective alternative to traditional methods. This review examines the role of wearable sensors in various paediatric neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, Gaucher disease, headaches, and sleep disorders.

This retrospective single centre study investigated the relationship between age at loss of ambulation (LOA) and late stage left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in 84 individuals (> 16 years old) with DMD taking glucocorticoid and ACE inhibitors treatment. Regression analyses showed a positive correlation between later age at LOA and higher LVEF in adulthood (linear regression estimate 1.49, 95 % CI: 0.13-2.84, p = 0.03). Each additional year of ambulation increased the odds of displaying a higher LVEF category (LVEF 40 %, 40 - 50 % or 50 %) by 35 % (p = 0.003). Sensitivity models excluding cardioprotective genotypes (absence of Dp116 isoform) and mild motor phenotypes (out of frame deletions amenable to skip exon 44 and 45) confirmed this association while models including age at respiratory impairment did not improve the model. Individuals who lost ambulation before age 11.92 (ROC AUC 0.73, 95 % CI: 0.60-0.85) reached a LVEF <40 % 5.21 years earlier than those who lost ambulation after that age (adjusted restricted mean survival time 19.08 vs 24.29 years, p < 0.001).

Medicine,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to dystrophin deficiency. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping offers potential by partially restoring dystrophin, though current therapies remain mutation specific with limited efficacy. To overcome those limitations, we developed brogidirsen, a dual-targeting ASO composed of two directly connected 12-mer sequences targeting exon 44 using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. An open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 trial assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of brogidirsen in six ambulant patients with DMD amenable to exon 44 skipping. Following dose escalation, extended 24-week treatment with 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg yielded dose-dependent increases in dystrophin (16.63% and 24.47% of normal). Functional assessments indicated motor stabilization, and plasma proteomics revealed reductions in peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), titin (TTN), and myomesin 2 (MYOM2), highlighting potential biomarkers.

We hypothesized that immune responses to the micro-dystrophin transgene product may have mediated these IMM events. An interferon-gamma ELISpot assay was used to detect T cell responses to delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin peptide pools. ELISpot analysis suggested that IMM resulted from T cell-mediated responses directed against specific micro-dystrophin peptides corresponding to exons 8 and 9 (Case 1) and exon 8 (Case 2) of the DMD gene. In silico epitope mapping based on the patients' HLA-I alleles indicated greater probability for peptides derived from exons 8 and/or 9 to bind HLA-I, providing further evidence that peptides derived from corresponding micro-dystrophin regions may have higher immunogenic potential.

Clinical practice,"In preparation for future clinical trials involving individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia, it is important to ascertain the widespread impact of symptoms from the direct perspectives of patients and caregivers. In this study, we performed cross-sectional surveys using large-scale patient and caregiver data to identify the prevalence and average impact of symptoms and symptomatic themes experienced by adults with AD, MCI, and dementia. Subsequent analyses were used to determine which demographic and disease-specific factors are associated with more severe disease.
Fifteen adults with AD (6), MCI (8), and dementia (1) and 15 caregivers of adults with AD (7), MCI (6), and dementia (2) participated in qualitative interviews providing 1,166 and 1,097 unique quotes pertaining to symptom burden. Using open-ended questions from a comprehensive interview guide, participants were asked to identify the symptoms of AD that have the greatest effect on their lives or the lives of the individual for whom they provide care. A cross-sectional survey was then implemented inquiring about the potential symptoms of importance identified during preliminary qualitative interviews. Four-hundred thirty-three individuals (patients and caregivers) participated in the cross-sectional survey, providing more than 35,000 symptom rating responses. Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine how demographic and disease-specific characteristics correlate with symptomatic theme prevalence.
The most frequent symptomatic themes reported by individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia in the cross-sectional survey were memory problems (99.0%), problems thinking (90.3%), and communication difficulties (80.4%). Patients identified decreased satisfaction in social situations (1.45), fatigue (1.45), and memory problems (1.41) as the most impactful symptomatic themes (range 0-4).

We report changes in muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in participants with DMD, including changes in lean muscle volume (LMV), muscle fat fraction (MFF), and muscle fat infiltration (MFI) and their relationship to changes in functional parameters.
MRI data were obtained as part of a clinical study (NCT02310763) of domagrozumab, an antibody-targeting myostatin that negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with Dixon MRI data and corresponding functional data at baseline and weeks 49 and 97. Images were analyzed to evaluate changes in adductors, hamstrings, and quadriceps.
There was a positive correlation between increases in LMV and function. LMV changes in adductors (R = 0.51) and quadriceps (R = 0.54) showed a stronger correlation with function than LMV changes in hamstrings (R = 0.30). There was a negative correlation between MFF and MFI, respectively, and function in adductors (R = -0.57, R = -0.42), quadriceps (R = -0.59, R = -0.50), and hamstrings (R = -0.53, R = -048).

However, cardiomyopathies have a genetic substrate, and directing therapy towards the pathophysiology rather than the epiphenomenon of the disease may be a winning strategy. Gene therapy involves the insertion of genes or the modification of existing ones and their regulatory elements through strategies like gene replacement and gene editing. Recently, gene therapy for cardiac amyloidosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy has received approval, and important clinical trials are currently evaluating gene therapy methods for rare heart diseases like Friedreich's Ataxia, Danon disease, Fabry disease, and Pompe Disease.

The main aim was to evaluate the effect of 4 genetic modifiers and the location of DMD variants on disease severity in a DMD Argentine cohort. A secondary objective was to provide a summary of the current state of knowledge and association of the tested loci with DMD's phenotype. Two groups of patients with extreme phenotypes (Severe/Mild) were defined based on the age at loss of ambulation. SNVs in SPP1, LTBP4, CD40, and ACTN3 were genotyped, and their distribution was compared between groups using Chi-square or Fisher exact tests. Concurrent effects with glucocorticoids treatment, DMD mutation location (proximal/distal) and the other loci were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Additionally, we performed a systematic literature review to summarize and interpret the impact of modifiers on various DMD traits. ACTN3-rs1815739 was the only modifier loci of DMD progression in our cohort. A concurrent damaging effect between DMD mutation and ACTN3 was detected, identifying a possible interaction between distal variants and ACTN3 TT-genotype that need to be validated in a larger cohort. The systematic review showed agreement in the results when significant differences were reported. The employment of extreme DMD phenotypic groups was an innovative approach for identifying risk loci for disease severity. The interaction between DMD mutation location and ACTN3, if confirmed, could help to avoid confounding elements in assembling study cohorts for clinical trials.

In a completed clinical trial golodirsen, approved by FDA to induce skipping of DMD gene exon 53 in eligible patients, we demonstrated increase in DMD expression and protein production, albeit with inter-patient variability.
Here, we investigate further the golodirsen mechanism of action using myotubes derived from MyoD transfected fibroblasts isolated from DMD patients at the baseline of the clinical trial SRP-4053.
We confirm golodirsen's selectivity and efficiency in removing only exon 53. For the first time in human cells, we revealed a significant reduction in the so called DMD ""transcript imbalance"", in golodirsen-treated DMD muscle cultures. The transcript imbalance is a unique DMD phenomenon characterized by non-homogeneous transcript expression along its entire length and responsible for the reduced stability of the transcript. Our in-vivo study also showed that the efficiency of exon skipping did not always correspond to a proportional restoration of the dystrophin protein. Predominant nuclear localization of the DMD transcript, observed in patients and animal models, persists even after exon skipping.
All these findings suggest challenges other than AON delivery for high level of protein restoration in DMD, highlighting the importance of investigating the biological mechanisms upstream of protein production to further enhance the efficiency of any AON treatment in this condition.",,"We confirm golodirsen's selectivity and efficiency in removing only exon 53.

We present the data supporting this qualification, providing insights into the evidentiary basis of qualification as a digital clinical outcome assessment. Clinical trials, natural history studies, and patient surveys (ages 5 - 14 years) showed that SV95C is accurate, valid, reliable, sensitive, and clinically meaningful. SV95C significantly correlated with traditional DMD assessments, increased rapidly after steroid initiation (0.090 m/s 3 months post-treatment), and declined steadily in patients on stable steroid regimens. Compared with traditional assessments, SV95C demonstrated earlier sensitivity to disease progression (3 vs 9 months) and greater sensitivity at 12 months. Distribution- and anchor-based approaches revealed a change of - 0.10 to - 0.20 m/s as clinically meaningful.

Currently there are no FDA approved treatments for increasing PTC readthrough in nonsense mutation diseases, although one translational readthrough inducing drug, ataluren, has had conditional approval for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Europe and elsewhere for 10 years. Ataluren displays consistent low toxicity in clinical trials for treatment of several different PTC diseases, but its therapeutic effects on such diseases are inconsistent. The identity of the stop codon and its sequence context are major determinants of PTC readthrough efficiency in both the absence and presence of nonsense suppressors.

A quantitative clinical trial simulator (CTS) has been developed based on previously published five disease progression models describing each of the longitudinal changes in the velocity at which individuals can complete specified timed functional tests, frequently used as clinical trial efficacy endpoints (supine-stand, 4-stair climb, and 10 m walk/run test or 30-foot walk/run test), as well as each of the longitudinal changes in forced vital capacity and North Star Ambulatory Assessment total score. The model-based CTS allows researchers to optimize the selection of numerous trial parameters for designing trials for the five functional measures commonly used as endpoints in DMD clinical trials. This case report serves as a demonstration of the tool's functionality while providing an easy-to-follow guide for users to reference when preparing simulations of their own design. Two case studies, using input selection based on previous DMD clinical trials, provide realistic examples of how the tool can help optimize clinical trial design without the risk of decreasing statistical significance.

39583120,Mechanism of Genome Editing Tools and Their Application on Genetic Inheritance Disorders.,"CRISPR, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, base editor, cystic fibrosis, gene therapy, hemophilia, prime editor",Global medical genetics,"In the fields of medicine and bioscience, gene editing is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic approach for treating pathogenic variants in humans and other living organisms. With advancements in technology and knowledge, it is now understood that most genetic defects are caused by single-base pair variants. The ability to substitute genes using genome editing tools enables scientists and doctors to cure genetic diseases and disorders. Starting with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas, the technology has evolved to become more efficient and safer, leading to the development of base and prime editors. Furthermore, various approaches are used to treat genetic disorders such as hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. As previously mentioned, most genetic defects leading to specific diseases are caused by single-base pair variants, which can occur at many locations in corresponding gene, potentially causing the same disease. This means that, even when using the same genome editing tool, results in terms of editing efficiency or treatment effectiveness may differ. Therefore, different approaches may need to be applied to different types of diseases. Prevalently, due to the safety of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in gene therapy, most clinical trials of gene therapy are based on AAV delivery methods. However, despite their safety and nonintegration into the host genome, their limitations, such as confined capacity, dosage-dependent viral toxicity, and immunogenicity, necessitate the development of new approaches to enhance treatment effects. This review provides the structure and function of each CRISPR-based gene editing tool and focuses on introducing new approaches in gene therapy associated with improving treatment efficiency.",,,,2024-11-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Registries are a critical tool to provide real-world data on treatment patterns, their effects and health care provision within this evolving paradigm of care. This study aimed to evaluate the phenotypic and genotypic landscape, treatment patterns and health impact of SMA in Australia through the national registry.
This cross-sectional study investigated demographic, clinical and genetic information, sequelae of weakness, treatment patterns and patient-reported outcomes amongst individuals with SMA enrolled in the Australian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (ANMDR) from 1st January 2020 to 30th April 2023. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis and Chi-Squared or Fisher's exact tests for associations.
195 individuals with SMA enrolled into the ANMDR. 5/195 (2.6%) were deceased by censor date. Of (n = 190) individuals living with SMA, 104/190 (54.7%) were children. Minimum Australian prevalence was 0.73/100,000. 
Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, mortality and the multi-systemic health impact of SMA continue to be experienced within the Australian population. Healthcare provision must align with patient-centred outcomes, adapting to meeting their changing but ongoing care requirements. The study identified the considerable unmet need for multidisciplinary care, not only for adults with SMA but also for the emerging cohort of treated children, emphasising the imperative for comprehensive healthcare provision to address their evolving needs.

The current, most promising therapeutic avenue is based on gene replacement mediated by adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) using a shortened, but still functional, version of dystrophin, known as micro-dystrophin (µDys), to fit AAV capacity. The limited improvements observed in clinical trials suggest a sub-optimal performance of µDys in the human context that could be due to the lack of key domains in the protein. Therefore, expressing larger dystrophin proteins may be necessary for a more complete correction of the disease phenotype. In this study, we developed three novel midi-dystrophin constructs using a dual-AAV approach, leveraging split-intein-based protein trans-splicing. The midi-dystrophins include additional domains compared to µDys, such as the central cytoskeleton-binding domain, nNOS and Par1b interacting domains, and a complete C-terminal region. Given the limited capacity of each AAV vector, we strategically partially reduced hinge regions while ensuring that the structural stability of the protein remains intact. We predicted the interactions between the two halves of the split midi-Dys proteins thanks to the deep learning algorithm AphaFold3. We observed strong associations between the N- and C-termini in midi-Dys 1 and 2, while a weaker interaction in midi-Dys 3 was revealed. Our subsequent experiments confirmed the efficient protein trans-splicing both in vitro and in vivo in DBA2/mdx mice of the midi-Dys 1 and 2 and not in midi-Dys 3 as expected from the structural prediction. Additionally, we demonstrated that midi-Dys 1 and 2 exhibit significant therapeutic efficacy in DBA2/mdx mice, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents for DMD. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of deep learning-based structural modeling for the generation of intein-based dystrophin versions and pose the basis for further investigation of these new midi-dystrophins versions for clinical studies.",,,,2024-10-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

39342355,Predictors of cardiac disease in duchenne muscular dystrophy: a systematic review and evidence grading.,"Cardiomyopathy, GRADE, Guidelines, Heart, Neuromuscular disease, Treatment",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare disease that causes progressive muscle degeneration resulting in life-threatening cardiac complications. The objective of this systematic literature review was to describe and grade the published evidence of predictors of cardiac disease in DMD.
The review encompassed searches of Embase, MEDLINE ALL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2022, for predictors of cardiac disease in DMD. The certainty of evidence (i.e., very low to high) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework.
We included 33 publications encompassing 9,232 patients with DMD. We found moderate- to high-quality evidence that cardiac medication (i.e., ACE inhibitors [enalapril and perindopril], β-blockers [carvedilol], and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [eplerenone]) are significantly associated with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and left ventricular circumferential strain (LVCS). DMD mutations in exons 51 and 52 were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of cardiomyopathy; deletions treatable by exon 53 skipping and mutations in the Dp116 coding region with improved LVEF and prolonged cardiac dysfunction-free survival; and exons 45-50 and 52 with early left ventricular systolic dysfunction (low/very low-quality evidence). We found high-quality evidence that glucocorticoids (deflazacort) are significantly associated with preserved LVEF and improved fractional shortening (FS), and low-quality evidence that glucocorticoids (deflazacort, prednisone, and/or prednisolone) are associated with improved ejection fraction (EF) and lower risk of cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure-related mortality. Full-time mechanical ventilation was found to be significantly correlated with LVEF (low-quality evidence), muscle strength with FS (low-quality evidence), and genetic modifiers (i.e., LTBP4 rs10880 and ACTN3) with LVEF, lower risk of cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dilation (low-quality evidence).
Several sources of cardiac disease heterogeneity are well-studied in patients with DMD. Yet, the certainty of evidence is generally low, and little is known of the contribution of non-pharmacological interventions, as well as the impact of different criteria for initiation of specific treatments. Our findings help raise awareness of prevailing unmet needs, shape expectations of treatment outcomes, and inform the design of future research.",,"We included 33 publications encompassing 9,232 patients with DMD.

Nowadays, early intervention focuses almost exclusively on gross motor skills.
We aimed to explore early motor development in preschool boys with DMD and investigate the influence of cognition.
Seventeen boys with DMD (11 months- 6 years) were compared to typically developing (TD) peers and followed-up with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III); Peabody developmental motor scales (PDMS-II) and Motor Function Measure (MFM-20). The longitudinal evolution of fine and gross motor skills was investigated using linear mixed effect models (LMM). Cognition was added to the LMM as a covariate.
Preschool boys with DMD scored lower compared to TD peers on both fine and gross motor skills (p<0.001). The evolution of motor development was subscale-dependent. A significant influence of cognition was found on different subscales (p= 0.002-0.04).
Preschool boys with DMD do not achieve the same functioning level as TD boys. Cognition plays a crucial role in the evolution of motor skills. Our results suggest a shift to a broader psychomotor approach including both fine and gross motor skills, also considering the impact of cognition. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS?: Our study provides a detailed mapping of early fine and gross motor development in preschool boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and describes the influence of cognition on both fine and gross motor skills. Preschool boys with DMD do not achieve the same functioning level compared to typically developing boys. They score significantly lower on both fine and gross motor skills. The evolution of fine and gross motor development was subscale-dependent e.g. a negative-positive evolution was seen for grasping skills, with a tipping point around the age of four; stationary scaled scores decreased followed by a stabilization around the age four to five and locomotion scaled scores remained stable over time. Finally, we also found that cognition plays a crucial role in the evolution of both fine and gross motor skills. These new insights in the evolution of early motor development could be of added value for future clinical trials in young boys with DMD. Subsequently, increased alertness to early symptoms, e.g. developmental delay, may advance the age of diagnosis, as well as associated early intervention.",,,,2024-09-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

It is still unclear how these growth-related side-effects affect motor function.
This retrospective cohort study utilized 2228 observations from 648 participants in the UK NorthStar database who had growth and ambulation data recorded between 2006 and 2020. Joint modelling was used to analyse the effect of longitudinal growth centiles on loss of ambulation with respect to GC type and regimen.
Loss of ambulation was observed in 113 patients. National estimates of loss of ambulation age were updated by GC group and showed no significant association between loss of ambulation risk and absolute growth centile. However, yearly drift in weight and/or height centile had an associated risk effect on loss of ambulation. Over a 2-year period, a yearly drift in weight from the 50th to the 75th, 75th to the 90th and 90th to the 95th centile was associated with 138%, 118% and 64% increased risk of loss of ambulation, respectively. Conversely, a 2-year drift in height from the 50th to the 25th, 25th to the 10th and 10th to the 5th centile was associated with 53%, 49% and 35% decreased risk of loss of ambulation, respectively.

Managing DMD takes a multidisciplinary approach, although long-term corticosteroid therapy remains a significant therapeutic tool. Based on the available published studies, unequivocal comparison between the benefits of the three medications cannot yet be made.

This study was aimed to investigate the effect of cycling training on balance and spatio-temporal gait parameters in children with DMD.
Ambulant children (age range: 6.17-11.33 years) were randomly divided into two groups: home-based exercise training applied in the control group (n = 12) while 12 weeks of supervised submaximal lower extremity cycling training in addition to home-based exercise training performed in the study group (n = 11). Gait and balance parameters were evaluated using the GAITRite electronic walkway system and the Bertec Balance Check Screener™, respectively.

Glutaminase-1 (GLS1) is reported to be involved in the survival of senescent cells, and inhibition of GLS1 alleviates age-related dysfunction via senescent cell removal. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the association between MSC senescence and GLS1. We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the effect of GLS1 inhibition on senolysis and the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Inhibition of GLS1 in Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) reduced the expression of aging-related markers, such as p16, p21, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype genes, by senolysis. Replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs, which recovered after short-term treatment with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES), showed increased proliferation and therapeutic effects compared to those observed with senescent WJ-MSCs. Moreover, compared to senescent WJ-MSCs, replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs inhibited apoptosis in serum-starved C2C12 cells, enhanced muscle formation, and hindered apoptosis and fibrosis in mdx mice. These results imply that GLS1 inhibition can ameliorate the therapeutic effects of senescent WJ-MSCs in patients with muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, GLS1 is a key factor in modulating the senescence mechanism of MSCs, and regulation of GLS1 may enhance the therapeutic effects of senescent MSCs, thereby increasing the success rate of clinical trials involving MSCs.",,,,2024-08-09,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
39102172,Clinical Evidence Supporting FDA Approval of Gene and RNA Therapies for Rare Inherited Conditions.,,Paediatric drugs,"Gene and RNA therapies have potential to transform the treatment of rare inherited diseases, but there are concerns about the evidence supporting their use and high costs.
We analyze the evidence supporting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of gene and RNA therapies for rare inherited diseases and discuss implications for clinical practice and policy.
We conducted a qualitative analysis of FDA documents outlining the basis of approval for gene and RNA therapies approved for rare inherited diseases between 2016 and 2023. For each drug, we gathered five characteristics of the evidence supporting FDA approval (no phase 3 trial, nonrandomized, no clinical endpoint, lack of demonstrated benefit, and significant protocol deviation) and four characteristics of the FDA approval process (prior rejection or complete response, negative committee vote, discrepancy between label and trial population, and boxed warning). The main outcome was the number of drugs with each characteristic.
Between 2016 and 2023, 19 gene and RNA therapies received FDA approval to treat rare inherited diseases. The most common limitations in the evidence supporting approval of these drugs were nonrandomized studies (8/19, 42%), no clinical endpoint (7/19, 37%), lack of demonstrated benefit or inconsistent results (4/19, 21%), and no phase 3 trial (4/19, 21%). Half (3/6) of accelerated approvals and 57% (5/9) of drugs with breakthrough designation had nonrandomized trials, and gene therapies with one-time dosing were overrepresented (5/7, 71%) among the drugs with nonrandomized trials. Five of six accelerated approvals (83%) and five of nine pediatric drugs (56%), most of which were indicated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, had no clinical endpoint. Four of nine (44%) pediatric drugs and four of six (67%) accelerated approvals failed to demonstrate benefit compared with none of the nonpediatric drugs and none of the traditional approvals. Five drugs, which all had different indications and represented a mix of RNA and gene therapies, did not have any of these evidence characteristics. Among drugs that received prior rejections or negative committee opinions, all four had nonrandomized trials and lacked a clinical endpoint, and 75% (3/4) lacked demonstrated benefit. Five of nine (56%) pediatric drugs were indicated for broader age groups according to the drug label compared with the trial populations. Of the three drugs with boxed warnings, two had pediatric indications and nonrandomized studies, and one had no phase 3 trial.
Issues related to trial design, outcome, and data integrity in the evidence supporting FDA approval of rare inherited disease gene and RNA therapies raise questions about whether this evidence is adequate to inform prescribing decisions.

Rheumatology,"Common to all inflammatory arthritides, namely rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is a potential for reduced mobility that manifests through joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and ultimately joint damage. Across these conditions, consensus has been reached on the need to capture outcomes related to mobility, such as functional capacity and physical activity, as core domains in randomised controlled trials. Existing endpoints within these core domains rely wholly on self-reported questionnaires that capture patients' perceptions of their symptoms and activities. These questionnaires are subjective, inherently vulnerable to recall bias, and do not capture the granularity of fluctuations over time. Several early adopters have integrated sensor-based digital health technology (DHT)-derived endpoints to measure physical function and activity in randomised controlled trials for conditions including Parkinson's disease, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. Despite these applications, there have been no sensor-based DHT-derived endpoints in clinical trials recruiting patients with inflammatory arthritis. Borrowing from case studies across medicine, we outline the opportunities and challenges in developing novel sensor-based DHT-derived endpoints that capture the symptoms and disease manifestations most relevant to patients with inflammatory arthritis.",,,,2024-08-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
39061981,Recent Advances in Pre-Clinical Development of Adiponectin Receptor Agonist Therapies for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, adiponectin, cardiomyopathy, inflammation, skeletal muscle",Biomedicines,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by genetic mutations in the cytoskeletal-sarcolemmal anchor protein dystrophin. Repeated cycles of sarcolemmal tearing and repair lead to a variety of secondary cellular and physiological stressors that are thought to contribute to weakness, atrophy, and fibrosis. Collectively, these stressors can contribute to a pro-inflammatory milieu in locomotor, cardiac, and respiratory muscles. Given the many unwanted side effects that accompany current anti-inflammatory steroid-based approaches for treating DMD (e.g., glucocorticoids), there is a need to develop new therapies that address inflammation and other cellular dysfunctions. Adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) agonists, which stimulate AdipoR1 and R2 isoforms on various cell types, have emerged as therapeutic candidates for DMD due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and pro-myogenic properties in pre-clinical human and rodent DMD models. Although these molecules represent a new direction for therapeutic intervention, the mechanisms through which they elicit their beneficial effects are not yet fully understood, and DMD-specific data is limited. The overarching goal of this review is to investigate how adiponectin signaling may ameliorate pathology associated with dystrophin deficiency through inflammatory-dependent and -independent mechanisms and to determine if current data supports their future progression to clinical trials.",,,,2024-07-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for β-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials.

This review article thoroughly assesses primary and secondary DMD therapies, focusing on innovative modalities. The primary therapy addresses the genetic abnormality causing DMD, specifically the absence or reduced expression of dystrophin. Gene replacement therapies, such as exon skipping, readthrough, and gene editing technologies, show promise in restoring dystrophin expression. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), a recent advancement in viral vector-based gene therapies, have shown encouraging results in preclinical and clinical studies. Secondary therapies aim to maintain muscle function and improve quality of life by mitigating DMD symptoms and complications. Glucocorticoid drugs like prednisone and deflazacort have proven effective in slowing disease progression and delaying loss of ambulation. Supportive treatments targeting calcium dysregulation, histone deacetylase, and redox imbalance are also crucial for preserving overall health and function. Additionally, the review includes a detailed table of ongoing and approved clinical trials for DMD, exploring various therapeutic approaches such as gene therapies, exon skipping drugs, utrophin modulators, anti-inflammatory agents, and novel compounds.

Lack of dystrophin in skeletal muscles leads to intrinsic weakness, injury, subsequent degeneration and fibrosis, decreasing contractile function. Dystropathology eventually presents in all inspiratory and expiratory muscles of breathing, severely curtailing their critical function. In people with DMD, premature death is caused by respiratory or cardiac failure. There is an urgent need to develop therapies that improve quality of life and extend life expectancy in DMD. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of information on respiratory control in animal models of DMD, and respiratory outcome measures are often limited or absent in clinical trials. Characterization of respiratory performance in murine and canine models has revealed extensive remodelling of the diaphragm, the major muscle of inspiration. However, significant compensation by extradiaphragmatic muscles of breathing is evident in early disease, contributing to preservation of peak respiratory system performance. Loss of compensation afforded by accessory muscles in advanced disease is ultimately associated with compromised respiratory performance. A new and potentially more translatable murine model of DMD, the D2.mdx mouse, has recently been developed. Respiratory performance in D2.mdx mice is yet to be characterized fully. However, based on histopathological features, D2.mdx mice might serve as useful preclinical models, facilitating the testing of new therapeutics that rescue respiratory function. This review summarizes the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with DMD both in humans and in animal models, with a focus on breathing. We consider the translational value of each model to human DMD and highlight the urgent need for comprehensive characterization of breathing in representative preclinical models to better inform human trials.",,,,2024-07-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We estimated the minimal detectable change (MDC) for selected motor function measures in ambulatory DMD, i.e., the minimal degree of measured change needed to be confident that true underlying change has occurred rather than transient variation or measurement error. MDC estimates were compared across multiple data sources, representing >1000 DMD patients in clinical trials and real-world clinical practice settings. Included patients were ambulatory, aged ≥4 to <18 years and receiving steroids. Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for worsening were also estimated. Estimated MDC thresholds for >80% confidence in true change were 2.8 units for the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score, 1.3 seconds for the 4-stair climb (4SC) completion time, 0.36 stairs/second for 4SC velocity and 36.3 meters for the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD).

This results in the absence or dysfunction of the dystrophin protein, leading to muscle weakness, loss of ambulation, respiratory issues, and cardiac complications, often leading to premature death. Recently, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for DMD. Notably, the FDA has conditionally approved four ASO therapies for DMD, with numerous others in various stages of clinical development, indicating the growing interest and potential in this field. To enhance ASO-based therapies, researchers have explored the novel concept of conjugating peptides to the phosphorodiamidate morpholino backbone (PMO) of ASOs, leading to the development of peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs). These PPMOs have demonstrated significantly improved pharmacokinetic profiles, potentially augmenting their therapeutic effectiveness. Despite the optimism surrounding ASOs and PPMOs, concerns persist regarding their efficacy and safety. To comprehensively evaluate these therapies, it is imperative to expand patient populations in clinical trials and conduct thorough investigations into the associated risks. This article provides a comprehensive review and discussion of the available data pertaining to adverse reactions and toxicology associated with FDA-approved ASO drugs for DMD.

However, cardiotoxicity has emerged as a serious concern in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and X-linked myotubular myopathy. While this may be caused by systemic inflammatory effects of the treatment, high transgene expression in the heart may also play a role. Thus, certain muscle disorders may require a modulated level of therapeutic expression in the heart, while others may not require any cardiac expression at all. Additionally, the size of some cargos requires regulatory cassettes to be small enough that large cDNAs and other therapeutic payloads can be accommodated. Thus, we have performed enhancer/promoter optimization to develop highly minimized regulatory cassettes that are active in skeletal muscles, with either low or no detectable activity in cardiac muscle. Our No-heart (NH) cassette is active in most skeletal muscles, but exhibits only very low activity in extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, and diaphragm, and no activity in the heart. By contrast, our Have a Little Heart (HLH) cassette displays high activity in most skeletal muscles, comparable to the ∼800-bp CK8 cassette, with increased activity in EDL, soleus, and diaphragm, and low activity in the heart.

The TAMDMD (NCT03354039) trial assessed motor function, muscle strength and structure, laboratory biomarkers, and safety in 79 ambulant boys with genetically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 6.5-12 years of age, receiving either daily tamoxifen 20 mg or placebo for 48 weeks. In this post-hoc analysis, available echocardiographic data of ambulant patients recruited at one study centre were retrieved and compared before and after treatment. Data from 14 patients, median 11 (interquartile range, IQR, 11-12) years of age was available. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in participants assigned to placebo (n = 7) or tamoxifen (n = 7).

Current available treatment options aim to delay disease progression or stabilize physical function. To aid in healthcare providers' understanding of the symptoms of disease that impact patients' experience, this study explored children's physical functioning, activities of daily living (ADLs), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after receiving eteplirsen, a weekly infusion indicated for individuals with DMD with exon 51 skip-amenable mutations.
Fifteen caregivers of male individuals with DMD participated in a 60-min, semi-structured interview. Open-ended questioning explored changes in the children's condition or maintenance in abilities since eteplirsen initiation.
Children with DMD (age 7-15 years [mean 10.9]; steroid treatment at interview, n = 8; time since eteplirsen initiation 3-24 months [mean 14.9]) were described by caregivers as ambulatory (n = 9) and non-ambulatory (n = 6). Caregivers of ambulatory children reported improvements or maintenance of walking ability (n = 7/9), running (n = 6/9), and using stairs (n = 4/9). Continued decline in using stairs was reported by two caregivers. In upper-limb functioning, improvements or maintenances in fine-motor movements were reported by nearly half of all caregivers (n = 7/15), with one caregiver noting a continued decline. Subsequent improvements or maintenances in ADLs were described. Improvements or maintenances in fatigue (n = 9/15), muscle weakness (n = 7/15), and pain (n = 6/15) were reported, although some caregivers described a continued decline (n = 3/15 fatigue, n = 1/15 muscle weakness, n = 2/15 pain). Importantly, most caregivers who reported maintenances in ability perceived this as a positive outcome (n = 6/9).
This exploratory study indicated that most caregivers perceived improvements or maintenances in aspects of their child's physical functioning, ADLs, and HRQoL since eteplirsen initiation, which they perceived to be a positive outcome.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Early on, this weakness presents as difficulty walking, but eventually children lose the ability to walk, develop spinal curvature, and experience problems with the heart and lung muscles. People with DMD are missing a key protein in their bodies called dystrophin. Eteplirsen is a weekly, intravenous treatment approved to treat people with a specific DMD genetic misspelling. The goal of the treatment is to slow down the disease and delay the time to losing ability to walk or needing help breathing. Fifteen caregivers of children living with DMD participated in a 60-min telephone interview. Caregivers were asked questions about the child’s DMD symptoms and how those symptoms impact the child’s daily life. Caregivers discussed their child’s experience while receiving eteplirsen treatment and changes since the start of treatment. Caregivers described their child’s muscle weakness and how this has affected their movements (e.g., using stairs, running or walking). Since starting eteplirsen treatment, all caregivers reported some improvement or maintenance in parts of their child’s physical functioning, activities of daily living (e.g., sports/leisure, getting dressed and self-care), and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, pain and fatigue), even though some decline was also reported (e.g., physical functioning, getting dressed, self-care, muscle weakness, pain and fatigue). The results provide insights into physical functioning and quality of life of children with DMD who are receiving eteplirsen.

Included in this analysis were 51 subjects aged between 7 and 18 years who experienced LoA during follow-up in the PRO-DMD-01 natural history study. Mean age at LoA was 12.7 (7.1-18.6) years. Mean annual rates of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) <80%-predicted and performance of upper limb (PUL) 1.2 total score were smaller before than after LoA, but not significantly (FVC %-predicted: 5.6% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.21; PUL 1.2 total score: 2.3 vs. 3.8 units, p = 0.20).

Both hematological and neuromuscular genetic disorders benefit from genome editing approaches but face different challenges in their clinical translation. The ability of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to modify hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo has greatly accelerated the development of genetic therapies for blood disorders. In the last decade, many clinical trials were initiated and are now delivering encouraging results. The recent FDA approval of Casgevy, the first CRISPR/Cas9-based drug for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, represents a significant milestone in the field and highlights the great potential of this technology. Similar preclinical efforts are currently expanding CRISPR therapies to other hematologic disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies. In the neuromuscular field, the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9 has been instrumental for the generation of new cellular and animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), offering innovative platforms to speed up preclinical development of therapeutic solutions. Several corrective interventions have been proposed to genetically restore dystrophin production using the CRISPR toolbox and have demonstrated promising results in different DMD animal models. Although these advances represent a significant step forward to the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas9 therapies to DMD, there are still many hurdles to overcome, such as in vivo delivery methods associated with high viral vector doses, together with safety and immunological concerns. Collectively, the results obtained in the hematological and neuromuscular fields emphasize the transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas9 for patients affected by these debilitating conditions. As each field suffers from different and specific challenges, the clinical translation of CRISPR therapies may progress differentially depending on the genetic disorder.

We sought to understand the barriers faced by Hispanic/Latino families specifically and underrepresented groups more generally to clinical trial participation in Duchenne.
We engaged two participant groups: Hispanic/Latino caregivers of children with Duchenne in the US, including Puerto Rico, and health professionals within the broader US Duchenne community. Caregiver interviews explored attitudes towards and experiences with clinical trials, while professional interviews explored barriers to clinical trial participation among socio-demographically underrepresented families (e.g., low income, rural, racial/ethnic minority, etc.). Interviews were analyzed aggregately and using a thematic analysis approach. An advisory group was engaged throughout the course of the study to inform design, conduct, and interpretation of findings generated from interviews.
Thirty interviews were conducted, including with 12 Hispanic/Latina caregivers and 18 professionals. We identified barriers to clinical trial participation at various stages of the enrollment process. In the initial identification of patients, barriers included lack of awareness about trials and clinical trial locations at clinics that were less likely to serve diverse patients. In the prescreening process, barriers included ineligibility, anticipated non-compliance in clinical trial protocols, and language discrimination. In screening, barriers included concerns about characteristics of the trial, as well as mistrust/lack of trust. In consent and recruitment, barriers included lack of timely decision support, logistical factors (distance, time, money), and lack of translated study materials.
Numerous barriers hinder participation in Duchenne clinical trials for Hispanic/Latino families and other populations experiencing health disparities. Addressing these barriers necessitates interventions across multiple stages of the clinical trial enrollment process. Recommendations to enhance participation opportunities include developing clinical trial decision support tools, translating prominent clinical trials educational resources such as ClinicalTrials.gov, fostering trusting family-provider relationships, engaging families in clinical trial design, and establishing ethical guidelines for pre-screening potentially non-compliant patients.",,"Thirty interviews were conducted, including with 12 Hispanic/Latina caregivers and 18 professionals.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether scores from remote functional assessment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy correspond to in-person scores on the same functional assessments. Remote live stream versus in-person scores on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (including time [seconds] to complete the 10-meter walk/run and time to rise from the floor [supine to stand]) were assessed using statistical analyses, including intraclass correlation coefficient, and Pearson, Spearman, and Bland-Altman analyses. The remote and in-clinic assessments had to occur within 2 weeks of one another to be considered for this analysis. This analysis included patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, aged 4 to 7 years. Participants in this analysis received delandistrogene moxeparvovec (as part of SRP-9001-101 [Study 101; NCT03375164] or SRP-9001-102 [Study 102; NCT03769116]) or were randomized to receive placebo (in Part 1 of Study 102). This study evaluates score reproducibility between live stream remote scoring versus in-person functional assessments as determined by intraclass correlation coefficient, and Pearson, Spearman, and Bland-Altman analyses. The results showed that scores from remote functional assessment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy strongly correlated with those obtained in person. These findings demonstrate congruence between live stream remote and in-person functional assessment and suggest that remote assessment has the potential to reduce the burden on a family by supplementing in-clinic visits.",,,,2024-05-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Clinical practice,"The Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) scientific community needs access to patient-centered outcome measures that satisfy regulatory guidelines and are capable of tracking clinically meaningful changes in FRDA disease burden. The objective of this research was to develop a novel, disease-specific caregiver-reported outcome measure for use in FRDA research and clinical care.
In prior work, we conducted qualitative interviews and a cross-sectional study of FRDA caregivers and patients to determine the symptoms of greatest importance to individuals with FRDA. We designed the Friedreich Ataxia Caregiver-Reported Health Index (FACR-HI) to serially measure the symptoms of greatest importance to patients and utilized factor analysis, beta testing, reliability testing, and cross-sectional subgroup analysis to further evaluate and optimize this disease-specific outcome measure.
The FACR-HI was designed to measure total disease burden and disease burden in 18 symptomatic domains. The FACR-HI total score demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.98) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). Beta interview participants found the FACR-HI to be highly relevant, comprehensive, and easy to use. FACR-HI total and subscale scores were associated with functional staging for ataxia scores and speech impairment.
Initial evaluation of the FACR-HI supports its content validity, test-retest reliability, and construct validity as a caregiver-reported outcome measure for assessing how pediatric individuals with FRDA feel and function.

Treatment options have so far been limited. Gene therapy opens up new options for DMD patients.
Against the background of a further death following DMD gene therapy, the side effects and risks of the gene therapeutics already approved or undergoing clinical trials will be evaluated and alternative gene therapeutics will be described. Based thereon, the future of DMD gene therapy will be discussed.
For the first time, in June 2023, delandistrogene moxeparvovec (SRP-9001), a gene replacement therapy based on an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, was approved in the USA for children aged 4-5 years with DMD. Other promising gene therapies are in preclinical development or clinical trials, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategies to restore dystrophin expression. Two deaths following DMD gene therapy with high-dose AAV vectors were attributed to AAV-mediated immune responses. The pre-existing disease underlying the therapy is most likely involved in the fatal AAV toxicity.
Although gene therapy applications of AAV vectors are generally considered safe, the systemic administration of high vector doses can lead to severe side effects with a potentially fatal outcome in individual patients, especially after activation of the immune system. In the future, new methods for immunosuppression, reduction of AAV dose and alternative vectors will therefore increasingly come to the fore.
HINTERGRUND: Die Duchenne-Muskeldystrophie (DMD) ist eine schwere monogene Erberkrankung mit früher Manifestation und progredientem Verlauf. Die Behandlungsmöglichkeiten sind bislang begrenzt. Die Gentherapie eröffnet DMD-Patienten neue Optionen.
Vor dem Hintergrund eines weiteren Todesfalls nach DMD-Gentherapie sollen die Nebenwirkungen und Risiken der bereits zugelassenen und in der klinischen Erprobung befindlichen Gentherapeutika evaluiert und präklinische Ansätze beschrieben werden. Basierend darauf soll die Zukunft der DMD-Gentherapie diskutiert werden.
Im Juni 2023 wurde mit Delandistrogen Moxeparvovec (SRP-9001) erstmals eine Genersatztherapie, die auf einem Adenoassoziiertes-Virus(AAV)-Vektor basiert, für die Behandlung von Kindern im Alter von 4 bis 5 Jahren in den USA zugelassen. Weitere vielversprechende Gentherapeutika befinden sich in der präklinischen Entwicklung oder klinischen Testung, darunter eine CRISPR/Cas9-vermittelte Strategie zur Wiederherstellung der Dystrophinexpression (CRISPR/Cas9 „clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9“). Zwei Todesfälle nach DMD-Gentherapie mit hoch dosierten AAV-Vektoren lassen sich auf AAV-vermittelte Immunantworten zurückführen. Die der Therapie zugrunde liegende Vorerkrankung ist sehr wahrscheinlich an der fatalen AAV-Toxizität beteiligt.
Obwohl die gentherapeutische Anwendung von AAV-Vektoren allgemein als sicher gilt, kann die systemische Gabe von hohen Vektordosen durch Aktivierung der Immunabwehr zu schweren Nebenwirkungen mit möglicherweise tödlichem Ausgang bei einzelnen Patienten führen.

38730494,Short developmental milestone risk assessment tool to identify Duchenne muscular dystrophy in primary care.,"Child Development, Developmental Delay, Early Childhood Development, Motor skills, Pediatrics; neuromuscular disorder",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,"In patients without a family history, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is typically diagnosed at around 4-5 years of age. It is important to diagnose DMD during infancy or toddler stage in order to have timely access to treatment, opportunities for reproductive options, prevention of potential fatal reactions to inhaled anesthetics, awareness of a child's abilities needed for good parenting, and opportunities for enrolment in clinical trials.
We aimed to develop a short risk assessment tool based on developmental milestones that may contribute to the early detection of boys with DMD in primary care. As part of the case-control 4D-DMD study (Detection by Developmental Delay in Dutch boys with DMD), data on developmental milestones, symptoms and therapies for 76 boys with DMD and 12,414 boys from a control group were extracted from the health records of youth health care services and questionnaires. Multiple imputation, diagnostic validity and pooled backward logistic regression analyses with DMD (yes/no) as the dependent variable and attainment of 26 milestones until 36 months of age (yes/no) as the independent variable were performed. Descriptive statistics on symptoms and therapies were provided.
A tool with seven milestones assessed at specific ages between 12 and 36 months resulted in a sensitivity of 79% (95CI:67-88%), a specificity of 95.8% (95%CI:95.3-96.2), and a positive predictive value of 1:268 boys. Boys with DMD often had symptoms (e.g. 43% had calf muscle pseudohypertrophy) and were referred to therapy (e.g. 59% for physical therapy) before diagnosis.
This tool followed by the examination of other DMD-related symptoms could be used by youth health care professionals during day-to-day health assessments in the general population to flag children who require further action.
The majority of boys (79%) with DMD can be identified between 12 and 36 months of age with this tool. It increases the initial a priori risk of DMD from 1 in 5,000 to approximately 1 in 268 boys. We expect that other neuromuscular disorders and disabilities can also be found with this tool.","We aimed to develop a short risk assessment tool based on developmental milestones that may contribute to the early detection of boys with DMD in primary care.

However, scoring criteria for the identification of dSDB are missing.This study aimed to define and validate dSDB scoring criteria and to evaluate whether dSDB severity correlates with respiratory progression in DMD.
Scoring criteria for diaphragmatic apnoea (dA) and hypopnoeas (dH) have been defined by the authors considering the pattern observed on cardiorespiratory polygraphy (CR) and the dSDB pathophysiology.10 sleep professionals (physiologists, consultants) blinded to each other were involved in a two-round Delphi survey to rate each item of the proposed dSDB criteria (Likert scale 1-5) and to recognise dSDB among other SDB. The scorers' accuracy was tested against the authors' panel.Finally, CR previously conducted in DMD in clinical setting were rescored and diaphragmatic Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (dAHI) was derived. Pulmonary function (forced vital capacity per cent of predicted, FVC%pred), overnight oxygen saturation (SpO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO2) were correlated with dAHI.
After the second round of Delphi, raters deemed each item of dA and dH criteria as relevant as 4 or 5. The agreement with the panel in recognising dSDB was 81%, kappa 0.71, sensitivity 77% and specificity 85%.32 CRs from DMD patients were reviewed. dSDB was previously scored as obstructive.

We examined the efficiency and efficacy of this strategy with 4 microdystrophin constructs (3 in clinical trials and a variant of the largest clinical construct), in a severe mouse model of DMD, using AAV doses comparable with those in clinical trials. We achieved high levels of microdystrophin expression in striated muscles with cardiac expression approximately 10-fold higher than that observed in skeletal muscle. Significant, albeit incomplete, correction of skeletal muscle disease was observed. Surprisingly, a lethal acceleration of cardiac disease occurred with 2 of the microdystrophins. The detrimental cardiac effect appears to be caused by variable competition (dependent on microdystrophin design and expression level) between microdystrophin and utrophin at the cardiomyocyte membrane. There may also be a contribution from an overloading of protein degradation. The significance of these observations for patients currently being treated with AAV-microdystrophin therapies is unclear since the levels of expression being achieved in the DMD hearts are unknown. However, these findings suggest that microdystrophin treatments need to avoid excessively high levels of expression in the heart and that cardiac function should be carefully monitored in these patients.",,,,2024-05-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Clinical evaluation of DMD uses patient-intensive motor function tests, and the recent development of wearable devices allows the collection of a variety of biometric information, including physical activity.
In this study, we examined differences in physical activity and heart rate variability (HRV) between patients with DMD and healthy subjects using a wearable device, and investigated any association between these parameters and motor function in patients with DMD.
Participants were 7 patients with DMD and 8 healthy males, whose physical activity and HRV were provided by a wearable device. These data were used to investigate the relationship between both physical activity and HRV parameters and timed motor functional tests [Time to stand from supine, 10-meter walking time (10MWT), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and 6-minute walking test (6MWT)] in patients with DMD.
Results of 24-hours physical activity, fat burning, total number of steps and active distance, average step rate, average exercise intensity during walking, exercise, degree of forward lean during walking, maximum heart rate, normalized low frequency power (LF norm), and maximum exercise intensity in patients with DMD were lower than those in control subjects. Physical activity and HRV parameters did not correlate with the time to stand from supine. The 10MWT positively correlated with average heart rate, while NSAA negatively correlated with average heart rate, total frequency power (TF), and very low frequency power (VLF) during arousal. The 6MWT negatively correlated with ratio LF/high frequency power (HF).

Western Pacific,"The rapidly evolving clinical landscape of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is driving innovative approaches for early diagnosis through genomic newborn bloodspot screening (NBS). However, the potential impact of these programs on families and healthcare systems remains unexplored. This study assessed the perceived benefits, harms, barriers, and enablers for DMD NBS amongst primary caregivers of children with DMD and healthcare professionals (HCPs).
This Australian multi-centre cross-sectional study used a mixed-methods convergent methodology. Participants completed a codeveloped questionnaire and their perceptions on the utility, model of care, and processes of DMD NBS were thematically analysed.
Participants included 50 caregivers and 26 HCPs (68.5% and 53.1% response rate respectively). Most caregivers (40/50, 80%) perceived net benefits of DMD NBS and highlighted an early diagnosis as actionable knowledge, even with the current paucity of disease modifying therapies. This knowledge was valued to enable access to multidisciplinary supportive care (29/50, 58%), clinical trials (27/50, 54%), psychological support (28/50, 56%), inform reproductive planning (27/50, 54%), and facilitate financial planning based on the future needs of their child (27/50, 54%). Whilst HCPs acknowledged these opportunities, only 16/26 (61.5%) believed there were definite net benefits, with notable concerns over the psychological harms of diagnostic knowledge without a recourse to disease modifying therapeutic intervention early in life.
Caregivers and HCPs perceived a range of potential benefits of DMD NBS. Health system readiness will be founded on developing an integrated model of care that not only supports the psychosocial and information needs of families receiving a newborn diagnosis of DMD, but also provides care and clinical surveillance for individuals for whom a diagnosis may remain uncertain.

Neurology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common childhood muscular dystrophy, is caused by dystrophin deficiency. Preclinical and phase 2 study data have suggested that givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, might help to counteract the effects of this deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of givinostat in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 41 tertiary care sites in 11 countries. Eligible participants were ambulant, male, and aged at least 6 years, had a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, completed two four-stair climb assessments with a mean of 8 s or less (≤1 s variance), had a time-to-rise of at least 3 s but less than 10 s, and had received systemic corticosteroids for at least 6 months. Participating boys were randomly assigned (2:1, allocated according to a list generated by the interactive response technology provider) to receive either oral givinostat or matching placebo twice a day for 72 weeks, stratified by concomitant steroid use. Boys, investigators, and site and sponsor staff were masked to treatment assignment. The dose was flexible, based on weight, and was reduced if not tolerated. Boys were divided into two groups on the basis of their baseline vastus lateralis fat fraction (VLFF; measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy): group A comprised boys with a VLFF of more than 5% but no more than 30%, whereas group B comprised boys with a VLFF of 5% or less, or more than 30%. The primary endpoint compared the effects of givinostat and placebo on the change in results of the four-stair climb assessment between baseline and 72 weeks, in the intention-to-treat, group A population. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned boys who received at least one dose of study drug. When the first 50 boys in group A completed 12 months of treatment, an interim futility assessment was conducted, after which the sample size was adapted using masked data from the four-stair climb assessments. Furthermore, the starting dose of givinostat was reduced following a protocol amendment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02851797, and is complete.
Between June 6, 2017, and Feb 22, 2022, 359 boys were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 179 were enrolled into the study (median age 9·8 years [IQR 8·1-11·0]), all of whom were randomly assigned (118 to receive givinostat and 61 to receive placebo); 170 (95%) boys completed the study. Of the 179 boys enrolled, 120 (67%) were in group A (81 givinostat and 39 placebo); of these, 114 (95%) completed the study. For participants in group A, comparing the results of the four-stair climb assessment at 72 weeks and baseline, the geometric least squares mean ratio was 1·27 (95% CI 1·17-1·37) for boys receiving givinostat and 1·48 (1·32-1·66) for those receiving placebo (ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·745-0·989; p=0·035). The most common adverse events in the givinostat group were diarrhoea (43 [36%] of 118 boys vs 11 [18%] of 61 receiving placebo) and vomiting (34 [29%] vs 8 [13%]); no treatment-related deaths occurred.
Among ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, results of the four-stair climb assessment worsened in both groups over the study period; however, the decline was significantly smaller with givinostat than with placebo. The dose of givinostat was reduced after an interim safety analysis, but no new safety signals were reported. An ongoing extension study is evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of givinostat in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Classical GT aims to deliver transgenes to the cells via their random integration in the genome or episomal persistence into the nucleus through lentivirus (LV) or adeno-associated virus (AAV), respectively. Although high transgene expression efficiency is achieved by using either LV or AAV, their nature can result in severe side effects in humans. For instance, an LV (NCT03852498)- and AAV9 (NCT05514249)-based GT clinical trials for treating X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy showed the development of myelodysplastic syndrome and patient's death, respectively. In contrast with classical GT, the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing requires the homologous direct repair (HDR) machinery of the cells for inserting the transgene in specific regions of the genome. This sophisticated and well-regulated process is limited in the cell cycle of mammalian cells, and in turn, the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) predominates. Consequently, seeking approaches to increase HDR efficiency over NHEJ is crucial.

We present an in-depth analysis of promising therapeutic approaches targeting dystrophin and their implications for the therapeutic management of DMD. Several therapies aiming to restore dystrophin protein or address secondary pathology have obtained regulatory approval, and many others are ongoing clinical development. Notably, recent advancements in genetic approaches have demonstrated the potential to restore partially functional dystrophin forms. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of the status of clinical trials for major therapeutic genetic approaches for DMD.

We analyzed the expression of the muscle regeneration markers (FOXP3 and AREG) in circulating leukocytes of DMD patients with different lower limb muscle functions and whether ω-3 LCPUFAs regulate the expression of those markers, and the populations of circulating T-cells, their intracellular cytokines, and disease progression (CD69 and CD49d) markers.
This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in DMD boys supplemented with ω-3 LCPUFAs (n = 18) or placebo (sunflower oil, n = 13) for six months. FOXP3 and AREG mRNA expression in leukocytes, immunophenotyping of T-cell populations, CD49d and CD69 markers, and intracellular cytokines in blood samples were analyzed at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, and 6 of supplementation.
Patients with assisted ambulation expressed higher (P = 0.015) FOXP3 mRNA levels than ambulatory patients. The FOXP3 mRNA expression correlated (Rho = -0.526, P = 0.03) with the Vignos scale score at month six of supplementation with ω-3 LCPUFAs. CD49d + CD8 + T-cells population was lower (P = 0.037) in the ω -3 LCPUFAs group than placebo at month six of supplementation.

The median life expectancy at birth is around 30 years due to a rapid and severe disease progression. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, and the standard of care is mainly palliative therapy and glucocorticoids to mitigate symptoms and improve quality of life. Recent advances in phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) technology has proven optimistic in providing a disease-modifying therapy rather than a palliative treatment option through correcting the primary genetic defect of DMD by exon skipping. However, as a result of the high variance in mutations of the dystrophin gene causing DMD, it has been challenging to tailor an effective therapy in most patients. Viltolarsen is effective in 8% of patients and accurately skips exon 53, reestablishing the reading frame and producing a functional form of dystrophin and milder disease phenotype. Results of recently concluded preclinical and clinical trials show significantly increased dystrophin protein expression, no severe adverse effects, and stabilization of motor function. In summary, viltolarsen has provided hope for those working toward giving patients a safe and viable treatment option for managing DMD. This review summarizes an overview of the presentation, pathophysiology, genetics, and current treatment guidelines of DMD, pharmacological profile of viltolarsen, and a summary of the safety and efficacy with additional insights using recent clinical trial data.",,,,2024-02-20,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks and to study crossover participants (prednisone to vamorolone; placebo to vamorolone).
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and prednisone-controlled clinical trial of 2 doses of vamorolone was conducted in participants with DMD, in the ages from 4 years to younger than 7 years at baseline. The interventions were 2 mg/kg/d of vamorolone and 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone for 48 weeks (period 1: 24 weeks + period 2: 24 weeks) and 0.75 mg/kg/d of prednisone and placebo for the first 24 weeks (before crossover). Efficacy was evaluated through gross motor outcomes and safety through adverse events, growth velocity, body mass index (BMI), and bone turnover biomarkers. This analysis focused on period 2.

This therapy was developed to address the underlying cause of DMD through targeted skeletal, respiratory, and cardiac muscle expression of delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin, an engineered, functional dystrophin protein.
Drawing on clinical trial experience from Study 101 (NCT03375164), Study 102 (NCT03769116), and ENDEAVOR (Study 103; NCT04626674), we outline practical considerations for delandistrogene moxeparvovec treatment.
Before infusion, the following are recommended: (1) screen for anti-adeno-associated virus rhesus isolate serotype 74 total binding antibody titers <1:400; (2) assess liver function, platelet count, and troponin-I; (3) ensure patients are up to date with vaccinations and avoid vaccine coadministration with infusion; (4) administer additional corticosteroids starting one day preinfusion (for patients already on corticosteroids); and (5) postpone dosing patients with any infection or acute liver disease until event resolution.

There are multiple ongoing clinical trials for DMD that are testing gene therapy treatments consisting of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors carrying miniaturized versions of dystrophin optimized for function, termed micro-dystrophins (μDys). Utrophin, the fetal homolog of dystrophin, has repeatedly been reported to be upregulated in human DMD muscle as a compensatory mechanism, but whether µDys displaces full-length utrophin is unknown. In this study, dystrophin/utrophin-deficient mice with transgenic overexpression of full-length utrophin in skeletal muscles were systemically administered low doses of either AAV6-CK8e-Hinge3-µDys (μDysH3) or AAV6-CK8e-μDys5 (μDys5). We used immunofluorescence to qualitatively assess the localization of μDys with transgenic utrophin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in quadriceps muscles. μDys protein resulting from both gene therapies co-localized at myofiber membranes with transgenic utrophin. We also confirmed the sarcolemmal co-localization of nNOS with μDys5, but not with transgenic utrophin expression or μDysH3. Transgenic utrophin expression and μDys proteins produced from both therapies stabilize the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex as observed by sarcolemmal localization of β-dystroglycan.

Symptoms include progressive muscle weakness, respiratory and cardiac complications, and premature death. Casimersen targets a specific mutation in the DMD gene that results in the absence of dystrophin protein, a key structural component of muscle fibers. While there is currently no cure for DMD, exon-skipping therapy works by restoring the reading frame of the mutated gene, allowing the production of a partially functional dystrophin protein. Clinical trials of casimersen have shown promising results in increasing dystrophin production, as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) droplets when compared to placebo. In a randomized double-blind trial, patients who received casimersen had significantly higher dystrophin levels when compared to those who received placebo. Casimersen therapy is administered through repeated intravenous infusions, although the optimal dosage and duration of treatment are still under investigation. Based on the completed and ongoing clinical trials, casimersen has been well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild and unrelated to casimersen. In 2021, AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Duchene muscular dystrophy in patients with a mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. These collective findings indicate that casimersen has the potential to elicit functional changes in individuals with DMD, although further studies are necessary to comprehensively evaluate the specific functional improvements.

FDA-approved gene therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, β-Thalassemia, hemophilia A/B, retinal dystrophy, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy have generated buzz around the ability to change the course of genetic syndromes. However, this excitement risks over-expansion into areas of genetic disease that may not fit the current state of gene therapy. While in situ (targeted to an area) and ex vivo (removal of cells, delivery, and administration of cells) approaches show promise, they have a limited target ability. Broader in vivo gene therapy trials have shown various continued challenges, including immune response, use of immune suppressants correlating to secondary infections, unknown outcomes of overexpression, and challenges in driving tissue-specific corrections. Viral delivery systems can be associated with adverse outcomes such as hepatotoxicity and lethality if uncontrolled. In some cases, these risks are far outweighed by the potentially lethal syndromes for which these systems are being developed. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the field of genetic diseases to perform cost-benefit analyses for gene therapy.

The success of these trials currently relies on standard functional outcome measures that may exhibit variability within and between participants, rendering their use as sole measures of drug efficacy challenging. Given this, supportive objective biomarkers may be useful in enhancing observed clinical results. Creatine kinase (CK) is traditionally used as a diagnostic biomarker of DMD, but its potential as a robust pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker is difficult due to the wide variability seen within the same participant over time. Thus, there is a need for the discovery and validation of novel PD biomarkers to further support and bolster traditional outcome measures of efficacy in DMD.
Potential PD biomarkers in DMD participant urine were examined using a proteomic approach on the Somalogic platform. Findings were confirmed in both mdx mice and Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog plasma samples.
Changes in the N-terminal fragment of titin, a well-known, previously characterized biomarker of DMD, were correlated with the expression of microdystrophin protein in mice, dogs, and humans. Further, titin levels were sensitive to lower levels of expressed microdystrophin when compared to CK.
The measurement of objective PD biomarkers such as titin may provide additional confidence in the assessment of the mechanism of action and efficacy in gene therapy clinical trials of DMD.

38190001,The Clinical Development of Taldefgrobep Alfa: An Anti-Myostatin Adnectin for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Clinical trial, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Myostatin, Neuromuscular disorder, Taldefgrobep alfa",Neurology and therapy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic muscle disorder that manifests during early childhood and is ultimately fatal. Recently approved treatments targeting the genetic cause of DMD are limited to specific subpopulations of patients, highlighting the need for therapies with wider applications. Pharmacologic inhibition of myostatin, an endogenous inhibitor of muscle growth produced almost exclusively in skeletal muscle, has been shown to increase muscle mass in several species, including humans. Taldefgrobep alfa is an anti-myostatin recombinant protein engineered to bind to and block myostatin signaling. Preclinical studies of taldefgrobep alfa demonstrated significant decreases in myostatin and increased lower limb volume in three animal species, including dystrophic mice.
This manuscript reports the cumulative data from three separate clinical trials of taldefgrobep alfa in DMD: a phase 1 study in healthy adult volunteers (NCT02145234), and two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in ambulatory boys with DMD-a phase 1b/2 trial assessing safety (NCT02515669) and a phase 2/3 trial including the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) as the primary endpoint (NCT03039686).
In healthy adult volunteers, taldefgrobep alfa was generally well tolerated and resulted in a significant increase in thigh muscle volume. Treatment with taldefgrobep alfa was associated with robust dose-dependent suppression of free myostatin. In the phase 1b/2 trial, myostatin suppression was associated with a positive effect on lean body mass, though effects on muscle mass were modest. The phase 2/3 trial found that the effects of treatment did not meet the primary endpoint pre-specified futility analysis threshold (change from baseline of ≥ 1.5 points on the NSAA total score).
The futility analysis demonstrated that taldefgrobep alfa did not result in functional change for boys with DMD. The program was subsequently terminated in 2019. Overall, there were no safety concerns, and no patients were withdrawn from treatment as a result of treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events.
NCT02145234, NCT02515669, NCT03039686.
The goal of this program was to develop a treatment to improve muscle function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Muscle weakness in patients with DMD is progressive, leading to the irreversible loss of walking ability and eventually death due to cardiorespiratory failure. One potential way of improving muscle function is to target a protein known as myostatin that acts in healthy muscle to regulate muscle size. Studies in animals have shown that blocking myostatin can increase muscle size. Taldefgrobep alfa is a drug designed to block myostatin and it was shown to induce muscle growth in animals. A study in healthy volunteers found that taldefgrobep alfa was able to increase muscle size in humans and was not associated with safety concerns. Following this, a study was conducted in boys with DMD who were either treated with taldefgrobep alfa or a placebo. This first study in patients found that treatment was able to reduce myostatin levels and had a small effect on muscle size, supporting a larger trial in more patients with DMD. The aim of the larger trial was to test if taldefgrobep alfa had a meaningful effect on muscle function in patients with DMD. Results from this key trial did not meet the targeted improvement in function and a decision was made to end the trial and halt the use of taldefgrobep alfa as a potential treatment for DMD. No patients stopped treatment with taldefgrobep alfa as a result of adverse safety effects and no safety concerns were identified.",,"In healthy adult volunteers, taldefgrobep alfa was generally well tolerated and resulted in a significant increase in thigh muscle volume.

38189759,Characterization of Phenotypic Variability in Becker Muscular Dystrophy for Clinical Practice and Towards Trial Readiness: A Two-Years Follow up Study.,,Journal of neuromuscular diseases,"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a dystrophinopathy due to in-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene (DMD) which determines a reduction of dystrophin at muscle level. BMD has a wide spectrum of clinical variability with different degrees of disability. Studies of natural history are needed also in view of up-coming clinical trials.
From an initial cohort of 32 BMD adult subjects, we present a detailed phenotypic characterization of 28 patients, then providing a description of their clinical natural history over the course of 12 months for 18 and 24 months for 13 of them.
Each patient has been genetically characterized. Baseline, and 1-year and 2 years assessments included North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), timed function tests (time to climb and descend four stairs), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Walton and Gardner-Medwin Scale and Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired at baseline and in a subgroup of 9 patients after 24 months. Data on cardiac function (electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI) were also collected.
Among the clinical heterogeneity, a more severe involvement is often observed in patients with 45-X del, with a disease progression over two years. The 6MWT appears sensitive to detect modification from baseline during follow up while no variation was observed by MRC testing. Muscle MRI of the lower limbs correlates with clinical parameters.Our study further highlights how the phenotypic variability of BMD adult patients makes it difficult to describe an uniform course and substantiates the need to identify predictive parameters and biomarkers to stratify patients.",,,,2024-01-08,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

This study aims to evaluate FSHD disease progression over 1 year and to examine the sensitivity of several outcome measures in detecting changes during this interval.
We conducted a 12-month prospective observational study of 41 participants with FSHD. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months with serial strength testing (manual muscle testing or MMT and maximum voluntary isometric contraction testing or MVICT), functional testing (FSHD-Composite Outcome Measure or FSHD-COM, FSHD Clinical Severity Score or CSS, and FSHD Evaluation Score or FES), sleep and fatigue assessments, lean body mass measurements, respiratory testing, and the FSHD-Health Index patient-reported outcome. Changes in these outcome measures were assessed over the 12-month period. Associations between changes in outcome measures and both age and sex were also examined.
In a 12-month period, FSHD participant function remained largely stable with a mild worsening of strength, measured by MMT and standardized MVICT scores, and a mild loss in lean body mass.
The abilities and disease burden of adults with FSHD are largely static over a 12-month period with participants demonstrating a mild average reduction in some measures of strength. Selection of patients, outcome measures, and trial duration should be carefully considered during the design and implementation of future clinical studies involving FSHD patients.",,"In a 12-month period, FSHD participant function remained largely stable with a mild worsening of strength, measured by MMT and standardized MVICT scores, and a mild loss in lean body mass.",,2024-01-08,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To treat its complications, the rehabilitation program includes physical therapy, mainly on the musculoskeletal and the respiratory complications that appear on the evolution of the disease. This study aims to explore the effects of physical therapy with or without an at-home program on motor function among children with DMD.
A randomized controlled trial was carried out for one year (one group with at-home and conventional physical therapy and another with conventional physical therapy). Motor function was measured using the Motor Function Measure (MFM) scale, the Vignos and Brooke scales, the Timed-up-and-Go test, and the six-minute walk distance test.
Twenty-seven participants with DMD participated in this study. In the at-home and conventional physical therapy group, better motor function at the distal and global level was maintained, per the results of the MFM scale (P < 0.05). The rest of the variables did not achieve statistically significant changes.

38167117,Patient engagement in clinical trial design for rare neuromuscular disorders: impact on the DELIVER and ACHIEVE clinical trials.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Myotonic dystrophy, Patient and public involvement, Patient-focused drug development",Research involvement and engagement,"Engaging individuals living with disease in drug development and regulatory processes leads to more thoughtful and sensitive trial designs, drives more informative and meaningful outcomes from clinical studies, and builds trust between the public, government, and industry stakeholders. This engagement is especially important in the case of rare diseases, where affected individuals and their families face many difficulties getting information, treatment, and support. Dyne Therapeutics is developing therapeutics for people with genetically-driven muscle diseases. During the development of potential treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Dyne sought the opinions of individuals living with these diseases to inform its clinical trial design and to decrease the difficulties that participants and families might experience participating in them.
Dyne engaged individuals and families living with DMD and DM1 as expert partners in its clinical development programs. Dyne convened panels of affected individuals and care partners/parents of individuals living with DMD (n = 8) or DM1 (n = 18). Workshops focused on how affected individuals and their families evaluate and select clinical trials for participation, the importance, quality, and burden associated with individual trial design elements, participation considerations such as site location and the study visit design, patient privacy, the suitability and scope of travel and participant support programs, and the accessibility of content in the informed consent (or assent) forms. Dyne also engaged the DMD Community Advisory Board (CAB) to collect feedback and advice on designing optimal and meaningful clinical trials and measuring relevant outcomes.
The issues most important to individuals living with DM1 and DMD regarding clinical trials were the ability to participate/access to the trial, perceptions of benefit and risk of trials and potential treatments, the flexibility of participation, clear communication from the sponsor, availability of information from trusted sources, and patient enrollment. In response to the patient advisory workshops and CAB feedback, Dyne refined clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinic visit design, developed a travel service program to address the burden of clinical trial travel and enable long-distance and cross-border participation, planned for home visits when feasible, and allowed for adequate rest before clinic visit initiation and between assessments. Additionally, Dyne developed and implemented a transparent and consistent communications plan (including age-appropriate content) for trial participants and community members, and assessed and adjusted procedures to provide maximum participant comfort and lower anxiety, particularly with younger participants.
Ongoing communication with the Duchenne CAB and with DMD and DM1 patient advisory committee members allows Dyne to stay current with disease community perspectives and feedback on the needs and preferences of those affected and has provided valuable insights into the participant experience thereby helping Dyne initiate clinical trials that better meet the needs of affected individuals and their families.
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?: Including the viewpoint of people living with chronic diseases when developing new therapeutics helps address their specific needs and improve their quality of life. This is very important for rare diseases, where individuals and their families face many challenges getting information, treatment, and support. WHAT DID WE DO?: Dyne Therapeutics, a company focused on developing potential medicines for rare muscle diseases, actively involved individuals living with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) in their drug development process. Dyne organized workshops for individuals and families living with DMD and DM1 and participated in community advisory boards to gather input from patient advocacy organization leaders. HOW DID THIS HELP?: Partnering with individuals and families living with DMD and DM1 helped Dyne improve clinical trial design and reduce the difficulties affected individuals and their families face when participating in these trials. This valuable feedback has allowed Dyne to design clinical trials to better address the needs of those living with DMD and DM1.",,"The issues most important to individuals living with DM1 and DMD regarding clinical trials were the ability to participate/access to the trial, perceptions of benefit and risk of trials and potential treatments, the flexibility of participation, clear communication from the sponsor, availability of information from trusted sources, and patient enrollment.

We sought to synthesize and grade benefits and harms evidence of bisphosphonates in glucocorticoid-treated patients with DMD.
In this systematic review (PROSPERO identifier: CRD42020157606), we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for articles published from inception up to and including March 31, 2023, reporting results in any language from any study type. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations framework.
We identified 19 publications involving 1,010 children and adults from 12 countries across all inhabited continents except South America. We found high-quality evidence that bisphosphonates significantly increase the areal lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) Z score in glucocorticoid-treated patients with DMD. The greatest improvements were recorded in controlled settings among patients treated with intravenous zoledronate. Evidence of benefits to fracture risks was inconclusive and/or of low quality, primarily due to lack of controlled data and small samples. Bisphosphonates were generally well-tolerated, although adverse events related to the first infusion (i.e., ""acute phase reaction"") were frequently reported.

38162739,Evaluation of Chemically Modified Nucleic Acid Analogues for Splice Switching Application.,,ACS omega,"In recent years, several splice switching antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based therapeutics have gained significant interest, and several candidates received approval for clinical use for treating rare diseases, in particular, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These ASOs are fully modified; in other words, they are composed of chemically modified nucleic acid analogues instead of natural RNA oligomers. This has significantly improved drug-like properties of these ASOs in terms of efficacy, stability, pharmacokinetics, and safety. Although chemical modifications of oligonucleotides have been discussed previously for numerous applications including nucleic acid aptamers, small interfering RNA, DNAzyme, and ASO, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have solely focused on the analogues that have been utilized for splice switching applications. To this end, we present here a comprehensive review of different modified nucleic acid analogues that have been explored for developing splice switching ASOs. In addition to the antisense chemistry, we also endeavor to provide a brief historical overview of the approved spice switching ASO drugs, including a list of drugs that have entered human clinical trials.

Even with pharmacologic advances, survival remains poor. Lung pathology on PAH therapies still shows impressive occlusive arteriolar remodelling and plexiform lesions. Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are heart-derived progenitor cells exhibiting anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, are anti -fibrotic, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic to potentially impact several aspects of PAH pathobiology. In preclinical trials CDCs reduced right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure, RV hypertrophy, pulmonary arteriolar wall thickness and inflammation.
The ALPHA study was a Phase 1a/b study in which CDCs were infused into patients with Idiopathic (I)PAH, Heritable (H) HPAH, PAH-connective tissue disease (CTD) and PAH-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study was IRB approved and DSMB monitored. Phase 1a, was an open label study (n = 6). Phase 1b was a double-blind placebo-controlled study (n = 20) in which half received 100 million CDCs (the maximum feasible dose from manufacturing perspective) and half placebo (PLAC) infusions. Right heart catheterization (RHC) and cardiac MR imaging (cMR) were performed at baseline and at 4 months post infusion. Patients were followed over a year.
No short-term clinical safety adverse events (AE) were related to the IP, the primary outcome measure. There were no adverse hemodynamic, gas exchange, rhythm or other clinical events following infusion and in the 1st 23 h monitored in hospital. There were no long-term AEs over 12 months noted, including unrelated limited hospitalizations. No immunologic short or long-term AEs were noted. We examined exploratory outcomes across multiple domains to determine encouraging signals to motivate future advanced phase testing. Phase 1a data showed encouraging observations for both 50 and 100 million CDC doses. Several encouraging findings favouring CDCs (n = 16) compared to placebo (n = 10) were noted. On cMR, the RV end diastolic volume (RVEDV) and index (RVEDVI) decreased with CDCs with a rise in the PLAC group. The 6-min walk distance was increased 2 months post infusion in the CDC group compared with PLAC. With PLAC, diffusing capacity (DLCO) decreased at 4 months but was unchanged with CDCs. Serum creatinine decreased with CDCs at 4 months. Encouraging observations favouring CDCs were also noted for RV fractional area change on echo and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) on cMR at 4 months. No differences were observed for mean pulmonary artery pressures or pulmonary vascular resistance. Review of long-term data to 12 months showed continued decline in DLCO for the PLAC cohort at 6 months with no change through 12 months. By contrast, CDC subjects showed an unchanged DLCO over 12-months. For parameters exhibiting early encouraging exploratory findings in CDC subjects, no further improvement was noted in long-term follow up through 12 months.
Intravenous CDCs were safe in both the short and long term in PAH subjects and thus may be safe in larger cohorts, in line with our extensive track record of safety in clinical trials for other conditions. Further, CDCs exhibited encouraging exploratory findings across several domains. Repeat dosing (quarterly, over one year) of intravenous CDCs has been reported to yield highly significant sustained disease-modifying bioactivity in subjects with advanced Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Because only single CDC doses were used here, the findings represent a lower limit estimate of CDC's potential in PAH. Upcoming phase 2 studies would logically use a repeat dosing paradigm.

Natural history studies can inform the disease characteristics of DMD, and data from these studies can be used to plan and design clinical trials and as external controls for long-term studies. We report 12-month results from the largest natural history study of individuals with DMD in China receiving standard of care treatment.
This ongoing, multicentre, prospective, single-cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03760029) was conducted in Chinese male participants with DMD (ambulatory aged <6 years [Group 1; n = 99]; ambulatory aged ≥6 years [Group 2; n = 177], and non-ambulatory of any age [Group 3; n = 36]. The follow-up period is ≥24 months, with some participants followed for 30 months. The primary endpoint was time to clinical milestones due to DMD disease progression, and motor, pulmonary, and cardiac function. Secondary endpoints were quality of life (QoL) assessments.
Mean (standard deviation [SD]) age at screening was 3.4 (1.2), 8.6 (2.0), 12.3 (2.7) and 7.4 (3.5) years in Groups 1, 2, 3 and total respectively. Mean (SD) North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score at baseline was 21.2 (5.8) in Group 1, 19.5 (8.3) in Group 2 and 20.0 (7.7) in ambulatory total. Overall, the time to clinical milestones due to DMD disease progression was consistent with previous findings, in which loss of ambulation occurred at 13 years. There was a trend towards a decline over 12 months in NSAA and timed motor function from age 6 years, with the greatest reductions observed thereafter. There were no consistent trends in measures of QoL, although participants of any age generally had poorer outcomes at Month 12 versus their domain scores at baseline.
This study improves the understanding of DMD progression according to the current standards of care in the Chinese DMD population and may inform selected endpoints and patient populations in clinical trials.

Twenty-seven male subjects aged 5-19 years with DMD were included, nine in the control arm and 18 in the treatment arm to receive N-163 beta glucan along with conventional therapies for 45 days. While performing the analysis, steroid usage was also taken into consideration, those not administered steroids (Steroid -ve) (Control, n = 5; treatment, n = 9), those administered steroids (Steroid +ve) (Control, n = 4; treatment, n = 9).
IL-6 showed a significant decrease in the treatment groups, especially the N-163 Steroid -ve group. IL-13 decreased in both treatment groups and TGF-β levels showed a significant decrease in the treatment groups, especially the N-163 Steroid -ve group, (p < 0.05).

Through the transfer of specific nucleic acid to the target tissue, gene expression can be downregulated, augmented, or corrected thanks to the nucleic acid sequence as a support of gene expression. This is achieved through molecular interactions according to the sequence arrangement or the secondary structure of the molecules or through their catalytic properties. Over the past two decades, the rapid advances of knowledge and technologies in gene therapy have led to the development of different strategies and to the extension of its use to numerous indications, including certain cancers. Major success has been achieved in clinical trials and the field of gene therapy is booming. Several gene therapy products are now on the market in Europe, the United States, and China.

This scientific review explores the application of viral vectors and more specifically of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors as a potent gene delivery tool in the context of primary myopathies, highlighting its transformative potential. Focusing on primary myopathies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs), X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), and Pompe disease, we review the ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials that underscore the therapeutic promise of rAAV-based gene therapies. Recent developments in gene therapy have unveiled innovative gene transfer approaches, particularly with rAAV vectors. These vectors offer a well-tolerated and efficient means of delivering corrective genetic material to diseased muscles, thereby addressing the root causes of primary myopathies. Encouraging data from pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials have demonstrated the potential to ameliorate muscle function, reduce pathological manifestations, and enhance the quality of life for patients afflicted with these devastating diseases. However, the transition from bench to bedside is not without challenges. This review emphasizes the critical need for a comprehensive risk management strategy to better handle potential side effects and immune responses associated with gene therapy.

The study was conducted as part of Project HERCULES, a multi-stakeholder collaboration to develop tools to support health technology assessments of new treatments for DMD.
Health states were informed by a review of NHMs for DMD and input from clinicians, patients and caregivers, and defined using common outcomes in clinical trials and real-world practice. The primary source informing the NHM was the Critical Path Institute Duchenne Regulatory Science Consortium (D-RSC) database. This was supplemented with expert input obtained via an elicitation exercise, and a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of mortality data.
The NHM includes ambulatory, transfer and non-ambulatory phases, which capture loss of ambulation, ability to weight bear and upper body and respiratory function, respectively. The NHM estimates patients spend approximately 9.5 years in ambulatory states, 1.5 years in the transfer state and the remainder of their lives in non-ambulatory states. Median predicted survival is 34.8 years (95% CI 34.1-35.8).

A cohort of 83 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (5-75 years at baseline) were followed for up to 3 years with annual assessments. Muscle and pulmonary function outcomes were analyzed herein. Age-stratified statistical analysis and modeling were conducted to analyze cross-sectional data, time-to-event data, and longitudinal data to characterize these clinical outcomes.
Deletion mutations of dystrophin exons 45-47 or 45-48 were most common.

In this paper, we present the UK centiles for the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), the 10 m walk/run time (10MWR) and velocity (10MWRV), and the rise from floor time (RFF) and velocity (RFFV) created from a cohort of glucocorticoid treated DMD boys between the age of 5 and 16 years.
Participants were included from the UK NorthStar registry if they had initiated steroids (primarily deflazacorts/prednisolone, intermittent/daily) and were not enrolled in an interventional trial. Assessments were included if the participant had a complete NSAA, the timed tests had been completed or the corresponding items were 0, or the participant was recorded as non-ambulant, in which case the NSAA was assumed 0.

The objective of this systematic literature review was to synthesize and grade published evidence of factors associated with respiratory health and function in DMD.
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for records of studies published from January 1, 2000 (to ensure relevance to current care practices), up until and including December 31, 2022, reporting evidence of prognostic indicators and predictors of disease progression in DMD. The quality of evidence (i.e., very low to high) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework.
The bibliographic search strategy resulted in the inclusion of 29 articles. In total, evidence of 10 factors associated with respiratory health and function in patients with DMD was identified: glucocorticoid exposure (high- to very low-quality evidence), DMD mutations (low-quality evidence), DMD genetic modifiers (low-quality evidence), other pharmacological interventions (i.e., ataluren, eteplirsen, idebenone, and tamoxifen) (moderate- to very low-quality evidence), body mass index and weight (low-quality evidence), and functional ability (low-quality evidence).

Therefore, the restoration of functional dystrophin levels is a fundamental approach for DMD therapy. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is an emerging tool that provides noninvasive monitoring of muscle conditions and has been suggested as a treatment response biomarker in diverse indications. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of skeletal muscles has become a standard measurement in clinical trials for DMD, EIM offers distinct advantages, such as portability, user-friendliness, and reduced cost, allowing for remote monitoring of disease progression or response to therapy. To investigate the potential of EIM as a biomarker for DMD, we compared longitudinal EIM data with MRI/histopathological data from an X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mouse model of DMD. In addition, we investigated whether EIM could detect dystrophin-related changes in muscles using antisense-mediated exon skipping in mdx mice.
The MRI data for muscle T2, the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data for fat fraction, and three EIM parameters with histopathology were longitudinally obtained from the hindlimb muscles of wild-type (WT) and mdx mice. In the EIM study, a cell-penetrating peptide (Pip9b2) conjugated antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO), designed to induce exon-skipping and restore functional dystrophin production, was administered intravenously to mdx mice.
MRI imaging in mdx mice showed higher T2 intensity at 6 weeks of age in hindlimb muscles compared to WT mice, which decreased at ≥ 9 weeks of age. In contrast, EIM reactance began to decline at 12 weeks of age, with peak reduction at 18 weeks of age in mdx mice. This decline was associated with myofiber atrophy and connective tissue infiltration in the skeletal muscles. Repeated dosing of PPMO (10 mg/kg, 4 times every 2 weeks) in mdx mice led to an increase in muscular dystrophin protein and reversed the decrease in EIM reactance.
These findings suggest that muscle T2 MRI is sensitive to the early inflammatory response associated with dystrophin deficiency, whereas EIM provides a valuable biomarker for the noninvasive monitoring of subsequent changes in skeletal muscle composition. Furthermore, EIM reactance has the potential to monitor dystrophin-deficient muscle abnormalities and their recovery in response to antisense-mediated exon skipping.",,"MRI imaging in mdx mice showed higher T2 intensity at 6 weeks of age in hindlimb muscles compared to WT mice, which decreased at ≥ 9 weeks of age.

Natural history models capture the full disease pathway under current care and combine with estimates of new interventions' effects to assess cost-effectiveness by health technology decision-makers. These models require mortality estimates throughout a patient's lifetime, but rare disease datasets typically contain relatively few patients with short follow-ups. Alternative (published) sources of mortality data may therefore be required.
The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) was evaluated as a source of mortality and natural history data for future economic evaluations of health technologies for DMD and rare diseases in general in the UK population. This retrospective longitudinal cohort study provides flexible parametric estimates of mortality rates and survival probabilities in the current UK DMD population through primary/secondary records in the CPRD since 1990. It also investigates clinically significant milestones such as corticosteroid use, spinal surgery, and cardiomyopathy in these patients.

Glucocorticoids such as prednisone and deflazacort have powerful anti-inflammatory benefits and are the standard of care for DMD, but their long-term use can result in severe adverse side effects; thus, vamorolone was designed as a unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to retain efficacy and minimise these adverse effects. Extensive clinical trials (ongoing) have investigated the use of vamorolone for DMD, with two trials also for limb-girdle muscular dystrophies including dysferlinopathy (current), plus a variety of pre-clinical trials published. Vamorolone looks very promising, with similar efficacy and some reduced adverse effects (e.g., related to height) compared with other glucocorticoids, specifically prednisone/prednisolone, although it has not yet been directly compared with deflazacort. Of particular interest to clarify is the optimal clinical dose and other aspects of vamorolone that are proposed to provide additional benefits for membranes of dystrophic muscle: to stabilise and protect the sarcolemma from damage and enhance repair. The use of vamorolone (and other glucocorticoids) needs to be evaluated in terms of overall long-term efficacy and cost, and also in comparison with many candidate non-steroidal drugs with anti-inflammatory and other benefits for DMD.",,,,2023-11-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We describe the distinct types of cell-mediated interactions, such as cytokine/chemokine production as well as cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions between T lymphocytes and other immune cells, which target cells of the muscular or nervous tissues. Most of these interactions occur independently of exogenous pathogens, through ligand-receptor binding and subsequent signal transduction cascades, at distinct levels of specificity. Although this issue reveals the complexity of the system, it can also be envisioned as a window of opportunity to design therapeutic strategies (including synthetic moieties, cell and gene therapy, as well as immunotherapy) by acting upon one or more targets.

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) is used to augment cough function in these patients. Although MIE is widely used, there are few data to advise on the optimal technique. Since the introduction of MIE, the recommended pressures to be delivered have increased. There are concerns regarding the use of higher pressures and their potential to cause lung derecruitment and upper airway closure.
What is the impact of high-pressure MIE (HP-MIE) on lung recruitment, respiratory drive, upper airway flow, and patient comfort, compared with low-pressure MIE (LP-MIE), in patients with respiratory muscle weakness?
Clinically stable patients using domiciliary MIE with respiratory muscle weakness secondary to Duchenne muscle dystrophy, spinal cord injury, or long-term tracheostomy ventilation received LP-MIE (30/-30 cm H
A total of 29 patients (10 with Duchenne muscle dystrophy, eight with spinal cord injury, and 11 with long-term tracheostomy ventilation) were included in this study. HP-MIE augmented cough peak expiratory flow compared with LP-MIE (mean cough peak expiratory flow HP-MIE 228 ± 81 L/min vs LP-MIE 179 ± 67 L/min; P = .0001) without any significant change in lung recruitment, neural respiratory drive, or patient-reported breathlessness. However, in patients with more pronounced respiratory muscle weakness, HP-MIE resulted in an increased rate of upper airway closure and patient discomfort that may have an impact on clinical efficacy.
HP-MIE did not lead to lung derecruitment or breathlessness compared with LP-MIE. However, it was poorly tolerated in individuals with advanced respiratory muscle weakness. HP-MIE generates more upper airway closure than LP-MIE, which may be missed if cough peak expiratory flow is used as the sole titration target.

However, the clinical trials of HuSCs were restricted to the inadequacy of donors because of that freshly isolated HuSCs quickly lost the Pax7 expression and myogenesis capacity in vivo after a few days of culture. Here we found that oleanic acid, a kind of triterpenoid endowed with diverse biological functions with treatment potential, could efficiently promote HuSCs proliferation. The HuSCs cultured in the medium supplement with oleanic acid could maintain a high expression level of Pax7 and retain the ability to differentiate into myotubes as well as facilitate muscle regeneration in injured muscles of recipient mice. We further revealed that Tenascin-C acts as the core mechanism to activate the EGFR signaling pathway followed by HuSCs proliferation. Taken together, our data provide an efficient method to expand functional HuSCs and a novel mechanism that controls HuSCs proliferation, which sheds light on the HuSCs-based therapy to treat muscle diseases.",,,,2023-09-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Methods & clinical development,"High systemic doses of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have been associated with immune-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Although AAV was well tolerated in preclinical models, SAEs were observed in clinical trials, indicating the need for improved preclinical models to understand AAV-induced immune responses. Here, we show that mice dual-dosed with AAV9 at 4-week intervals better recapitulate aspects of human immunity to AAV. In the model, anti-AAV9 immunoglobulin G (IgGs) increased in a linear fashion between the first and second AAV administrations. Complement activation was only observed in the presence of high levels of both AAV and anti-AAV IgG. Myeloid-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced in the same pattern as complement activation, suggesting that myeloid cell activation to AAV may rely on the presence of both AAV and anti-AAV IgG complexes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed that activated monocytes were a primary source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which were significantly increased after a second AAV9 exposure. The same activated monocyte clusters expressed both Fcγ and complement receptors, suggesting that anti-AAV-mediated activation of myeloid cells through Fcγ receptors and/or complement receptors is one mechanism by which anti-AAV antigen complexes may prime antigen-presenting cells and amplify downstream immunity.",,,,2023-09-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Neurology,"Drug repurposing could provide novel treatment options for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Because tamoxifen-an oestrogen receptor regulator-reduced signs of muscular pathology in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of tamoxifen in humans as an adjunct to corticosteroid therapy over a period of 48 weeks.
We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 12 study centres in seven European countries. We enrolled ambulant boys aged 6·5-12·0 years with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and who were on stable corticosteroid treatment for more than 6 months. Exclusion criteria included ophthalmological disorders, including cataracts, and haematological disorders. We randomly assigned (1:1) participants using an online randomisation tool to either 20 mg tamoxifen orally per day or matched placebo, stratified by centre and corticosteroid intake. Participants, caregivers, and clinical investigators were masked to treatment assignments. Tamoxifen was taken in addition to standard care with corticosteroids, and participants attended study visits for examinations every 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to week 48 in scores on the D1 domain of the Motor Function Measure in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and began treatment). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03354039) and is completed.
Between May 24, 2018, and Oct 14, 2020, 95 boys were screened for inclusion, and 82 met inclusion criteria and were initially enrolled into the study. Three boys were excluded after initial screening due to cataract diagnosis or revoked consent directly after screening, but before randomisation. A further boy assigned to the placebo group did not begin treatment. Therefore, 40 individuals assigned tamoxifen and 38 allocated placebo were included in the intention-to-treat population. The primary efficacy outcome did not differ significantly between tamoxifen (-3·05%, 95% CI -7·02 to 0·91) and placebo (-6·15%, -9·19 to -3·11; 2·90% difference, -3·02 to 8·82, p=0·33). Severe adverse events occurred in two participants: one participant who received tamoxifen had a fall, and one who received placebo suffered a panic attack. No deaths or life-threatening serious adverse events occurred. Viral infections were the most common adverse events.
Tamoxifen was safe and well tolerated, but no difference between groups was reported for the primary efficacy endpoint. Slower disease progression, defined by loss of motor function over time, was indicated in the tamoxifen group compared with the placebo group, but differences in outcome measures were neither clinically nor statistically significant. Currently, we cannot recommend the use of tamoxifen in daily clinical practice as a treatment option for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to insufficient clinical evidence.

Because several cassettes are being tested in clinical trials, this study compared the efficacies of four shortened dystrophin-promoter combinations with implications for outcomes in clinical trials: MHCK7 or MCK promoter with a shortened dystrophin transgene containing the N-terminus and spectrin repeats R1, R2, R3 and R24 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin and rAAVrh74.MCK.micro-dystrophin, respectively); shortened dystrophin construct containing the neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS) binding site (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.DV.mini-dystrophin); and shortened dystrophin containing the C-terminus (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin.Cterm). Functional and histological benefit were examined at 4 weeks following intramuscular delivery in mdx mice. rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin provided the most robust transgene expression and significantly increased specific force output in the tibialis anterior muscle. Muscle environment was normalized (i.e. reductions in central nucleation), indicating functional and histological advantages of rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin.

Dystrophin protein expression is a biomarker used to evaluate treatments that restore patient dystrophin levels. Currently, a semiquantitative assay using western blotting, which normalizes dystrophin expression to that of a control population, is used for regulatory filing. However, the current methods are limited in terms of sensitivity, quantification, and reproducibility. To address this, a highly sensitive and quantitative sandwich immune assay using Single Molecule Counting technology was established, with recombinant dystrophin protein as the calibrator. Capture and detection antibodies were selected to detect full-length dystrophin. Using this optimized assay, dystrophin levels in muscle samples from Myotonic Dystrophy (n = 9) and DMD (n = 8) subjects were 93.2 ± 31.9 (range: 49.4-145.3) and 14.5 ± 6.8 (range: 6.18-22.6) fmol/total protein mg, respectively. The lowest concentration of dystrophin measured in the DMD samples was 5 times higher than that in the lower limit of quantitation, a level not detected by western blotting. These data indicate that this assay accurately and sensitively measured dystrophin protein and may be useful in clinical trials assessing dystrophin restoration therapies.",,,,2023-09-05,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

While enzyme replacement therapy has dramatically changed the outcome of patients with the disease, this strategy has several limitations. Gene therapy in Pompe disease constitutes an attractive approach due to the multisystem aspects of the disease and need to address the central nervous system manifestations. This review highlights the recent work in this field, including methods, progress, shortcomings, and future directions.
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) and lentiviral vectors (LV) are well studied platforms for gene therapy in Pompe disease. These products can be further adapted for safe and efficient administration with concomitant immunosuppression, with the modification of specific receptors or codon optimization. rAAV has been studied in multiple clinical trials demonstrating safety and tolerability.

In this review, the authors describe the state of the gene therapy approach in clinical trials for DMD. This therapeutics included gene replacement, gene substitution, RNA-based therapeutics, readthrough mutation, and the CRISPR approach.
Only a few drug candidates have yet been granted conditional approval for the treatment of DMD. Most of these therapies have only a modest capability to restore the dystrophin or improve muscle function, suggesting an important unmet need in the development of DMD therapeutics.

We simultaneously developed two multivariate models quantifying the longitudinal associations between 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and fat fraction measures from vastus lateralis and soleus muscles. We leveraged the longitudinal individual-level data collected for 10 years through the ImagingDMD study. Age of the individuals at assessment was chosen as the time metric. After the longitudinal dynamic of each measure was modeled separately, the selected univariate models were combined using correlation parameters. Covariates, including baseline scores of the measures and steroid use, were assessed using the full model approach. The nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed in Monolix. The final models showed reasonable precision of the parameter estimates. Simulation-based diagnostics and fivefold cross-validation further showed the model's adequacy. The multivariate models will guide drug developers on using fat fraction assessment most efficiently using available data, including the widely used 6MWD.

Health Utilities Index (HUI) scores, reflecting preferences for health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) implications of health states, are commonly estimated within trials. This study sought to characterize the relationship between the NSAA score and utility in DMD.
Family members serving as proxy respondents for placebo-treated ambulatory individuals with DMD (NCT01254019; BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc) completed the HUI and the NSAA (score range, 0-34). Mean change over time on these measures was estimated, and the correlation between changes in NSAA score and a) HUI utility; b) HUI3 ambulation and HUI2 mobility attribute scores, over 48 weeks was calculated.
Baseline mean (range) age was 8.0 years (5-16; n = 61) and mean (standard deviation [SD]) scores were 0.87 (0.13; HUI2), 0.82 (0.19; HUI3), and 21.0 (8.1; NSAA). Mean (SD) change over 48 weeks was -0.05 (0.14; HUI2), -0.06 (0.19; HUI3), and -2.9 (4.7; NSAA). Weak positive correlations were observed between baseline NSAA score and HUI utility (HUI2: r = 0.29; HUI3: r = 0.17) and for change over 48 weeks (HUI2: r = 0.16; HUI3: r = 0.15). Stronger correlations were observed between change in NSAA score and the HUI3 ambulation (r = 0.41) and HUI2 mobility (r = 0.41) attributes.

The identification of the dystrophin gene as central to DMD pathogenesis has led to the understanding of the muscle membrane and the proteins involved in membrane stability as the focal point of the disease. The lessons learned from decades of research in human genetics, biochemistry, and physiology have culminated in establishing the myriad functionalities of dystrophin in striated muscle biology. Here, we review the pathophysiological basis of DMD and discuss recent progress toward the development of therapeutic strategies for DMD that are currently close to or are in human clinical trials. The first section of the review focuses on DMD and the mechanisms contributing to membrane instability, inflammation, and fibrosis. The second section discusses therapeutic strategies currently used to treat DMD. This includes a focus on outlining the strengths and limitations of approaches directed at correcting the genetic defect through dystrophin gene replacement, modification, repair, and/or a range of dystrophin-independent approaches.

Advanced therapeutics in pulmonary care have significantly reduced respiratory complication-related mortality, making cardiomyopathy the main determinant factor of survival. While there are multiple therapies such as the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and ventilatory assistance targeted toward delaying the disease progression in DMD, a cure remains elusive. In the last decade, several therapeutic approaches have been developed to improve patient survival. These include small molecule-based therapy, micro-dystrophin gene delivery, CRISPR-mediated gene editing, nonsense readthrough, exon skipping, and cardiosphere-derived cell therapy. Associated with the specific benefits of each of these approaches are their individual risks and limitations. The variability in the genetic aberrations leading to DMD also limits the widespread use of these therapies. While numerous approaches have been explored to treat DMD pathophysiology, only a handful have successfully advanced through the preclinical stages. In this review, we summarize the currently approved as well as the most promising therapeutics undergoing clinical trials aimed toward treating DMD with a focus on its cardiac manifestations.",,,,2023-07-10,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

DEVOTE Part A evaluates safety and tolerability of a higher nusinersen dose; Part B assesses efficacy in a randomized, double-blind design; and Part C assesses safety and tolerability of participants transitioning from the 12-mg dose to higher doses.
In the completed Part A of DEVOTE, all 6 enrolled participants aged 6.1-12.6 years have completed the study. Four participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), the majority of which were mild. Common TEAEs of headache, pain, chills, vomiting, and paresthesia were considered related to the lumbar puncture procedure. There were no safety concerns regarding clinical or laboratory parameters. Nusinersen levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were within the range of modeled predictions for higher dose of nusinersen.

Additionally, assigning patients to long-term, multi-year placebo arms raises ethical and trial retention concerns. This poses a significant challenge to the traditional sequential drug development paradigm. In this paper, we propose a small-sample, sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (snSMART) design that combines dose selection and confirmatory assessment into a single trial. This multi-stage design evaluates the effects of multiple doses of a promising drug and re-randomizes patients to appropriate dose levels based on their Stage 1 dose and response. Our proposed approach increases the efficiency of treatment effect estimates by (i) enriching the placebo arm with external control data, and (ii) using data from all stages. Data from external control and different stages are combined using a robust meta-analytic combined (MAC) approach to consider the various sources of heterogeneity and potential selection bias. We reanalyze data from a DMD trial using the proposed method and external control data from the Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS). Our method's estimators show improved efficiency compared to the original trial. Also, the robust MAC-snSMART method most often provides more accurate estimators than the traditional analytic method.

Hallmarks include fibre-size variation and replacement of skeletal muscle with fibrous and adipose tissues, after repeated cycles of regeneration. Muscle histology can detect these features, but the required biopsies are invasive, are difficult to repeat and capture only small muscle volumes. Diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) is a potential non-invasive alternative that can calculate muscle fibre diameters when applied with the novel random permeable barrier model (RPBM). In this study, we assessed muscle fibre diameters using DT-MRI in BMD patients and healthy controls and compared these with histology.
We included 13 BMD patients and 9 age-matched controls, who underwent water-fat MRI and DT-MRI at multiple diffusion times, allowing RPBM parameter estimation in the lower leg muscles. Tibialis anterior muscle biopsies were taken from the contralateral leg in 6 BMD patients who underwent DT-MRI and from an additional 32 BMD patients and 15 healthy controls. Laminin and Sirius-red stainings were performed to evaluate muscle fibre morphology and fibrosis. Twelve ambulant patients from the MRI cohort underwent the North Star ambulatory assessment, and 6-min walk, rise-from-floor and 10-m run/walk functional tests.

A lack of comprehensive care for patients living with DMD is directly associated with a compromised quality of life (QoL) for those affected and their caregivers. This disease also has a huge economic impact on families as its treatment requires substantial direct, indirect, and informal care costs.
This study presents a protocol developed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a patient-centered care (PCC) model for children with DMD. The care model was designed with the aim to empower families, improve QoL, and reduce economic burden on their families.
This study is planned as a quasi-experimental study that will enroll 70 consecutive families with boys (aged 5-15 years) with DMD visiting a tertiary care center. The study is being conducted in 2 phases (preintervention and postintervention phases, referred to as phase 1 and phase 2, respectively). During phase 1, the patients received routine care. The study is now in phase 2, with the intervention currently being administered. The intervention is based on the PCC model individualized by the intervention team. The model has a comprehensive DMD telecare component that includes teleconsultation as one of its key components to reduce in-person physician visits at the health facility. Teleconsultation is especially beneficial for late-ambulatory and nonambulatory patients. Data on economic burden are being collected for out-of-pocket expenses for both phases during in-person visits via telephone or messaging apps on a monthly basis. QoL data for patients and their primary caregivers are being collected at 3 time points (ie, time of enrollment, end of phase 1, and end of phase 2). Outcome measures are being assessed as changes in economic burden on families and changes in QoL scores.
Participant recruitment began in July 2021. The study is ongoing and expected to be completed by March 2023. The findings based on baseline data are expected to be submitted for publication in 2023.
This paper outlines a research proposal developed to study the impact of a PCC model for patients with DMD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study is expected to provide evidence of whether a multicomponent, patient-centric intervention could reduce economic burdens on families and improve their QoL. The results of this study could guide policy makers and health professionals in India and other LMICs to facilitate a comprehensive care program for patients living with DMD. The economic impact of a rare disease is an important consideration to formulate or evaluate any health policy or intervention related to new treatments and financial support schemes.

This updated interim report (data cut-off: January 31, 2022), describes STRIDE patient characteristics and ataluren safety data, as well as the effectiveness of ataluren plus standard of care (SoC) in STRIDE versus SoC alone in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS).
Patients are followed up from enrollment for at least 5 years or until study withdrawal. Propensity score matching was performed to identify STRIDE and CINRG DNHS patients who were comparable in established predictors of disease progression.
As of January 31, 2022, 307 patients were enrolled from 14 countries. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) ages at first symptoms and at genetic diagnosis were 2.9 (1.7) years and 4.5 (3.7) years, respectively. Mean (SD) duration of ataluren exposure was 1671 (56.8) days.

37099511,Determining minimal clinically important differences in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,PloS one,"The North Star ambulatory assessment (NSAA) is a functional motor outcome measure in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), widely used in clinical trials and natural history studies, as well as in clinical practice. However, little has been reported on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of the NSAA. The lack of established MCID estimates for NSAA presents challenges in interpreting the significance of the results of this outcome measure in clinical trials, natural history studies and clinical practice. Combining statistical approaches and patient perspectives, this study estimated MCID for NSAA using distribution-based estimates of 1/3 standard deviation (SD) and standard error of measurement (SEM), an anchor-based approach, with six-minute walk distance (6MWD) as the anchor, and evaluation of patient and parent perception using participant-tailored questionnaires. The MCID for NSAA in boys with DMD aged 7 to 10 years based on 1/3 SD ranged from 2.3-2.9 points, and that on SEM ranged from 2.9-3.5 points. Anchored on the 6MWD, the MCID for NSAA was estimated as 3.5 points. When the impact on functional abilities was considered using participant response questionnaires, patients and parent perceived a complete loss of function in a single item or deterioration of function in one to two items of the assessment as an important change. Our study examines MCID estimates for total NSAA scores using multiple approaches, including the impact of patient and parent perspective on within scale changes in items based on complete loss of function and deterioration of function, and provides new insight on evaluation of differences in these widely used outcome measure in DMD.",,,,2023-04-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

37047330,Innovative Computerized Dystrophin Quantification Method Based on Spectral Confocal Microscopy.,"Becker muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, confocal microscopy, dystrophin, fluorescence quantification, spectral imaging",International journal of molecular sciences,"Several clinical trials are working on drug development for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) treatment, and, since the expected increase in dystrophin is relatively subtle, high-sensitivity quantification methods are necessary. There is also a need to quantify dystrophin to reach a definitive diagnosis in individuals with mild BMD, and in female carriers. We developed a method for the quantification of dystrophin in DMD and BMD patients using spectral confocal microscopy. It offers the possibility to capture the whole emission spectrum for any antibody, ensuring the selection of the emission peak and allowing the detection of fluorescent emissions of very low intensities. Fluorescence was evaluated first on manually selected regions of interest (ROIs), proving the usefulness of the methodology. Later, ROI selection was automated to make it operator-independent. The proposed methodology correctly classified patients according to their diagnosis, detected even minimal traces of dystrophin, and the results obtained automatically were statistically comparable to the manual ones. Thus, spectral imaging could be implemented to measure dystrophin expression and it could pave the way for detailed analysis of how its expression relates to the clinical course. Studies could be further expanded to better understand the expression of dystrophin-associated protein complexes (DAPCs).",,,,2023-04-14,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

As a synthetic nucleic acid, AOs can bind to a targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) and regulate splicing. AO-mediated exon skipping transforms out-of-frame mutations as seen in DMD into in-frame transcripts. This exon skipping approach results in the production of a shortened but still functional protein product as seen in the milder counterpart, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Many potential AO drugs have advanced from laboratory experimentation to clinical trials with an increasing interest in this area. An accurate and efficient method for testing AO drug candidates in vitro, before implementation in clinical trials, is crucial to ensure proper assessment of efficacy. The type of cell model used to examine AO drugs in vitro establishes the foundation of the screening process and can significantly impact the results. Previous cell models used to screen for potential AO drug candidates, such as primary muscle cell lines, have limited proliferative and differentiation capacity, and express insufficient amounts of dystrophin. Recently developed immortalized DMD muscle cell lines effectively addressed this challenge allowing for the accurate measurement of exon-skipping efficacy and dystrophin protein production. This chapter presents a procedure used to assess DMD exons 45-55 skipping efficiency and dystrophin protein production in immortalized DMD patient-derived muscle cells. Exons 45-55 skipping in the DMD gene is potentially applicable to 47% of patients. In addition, naturally occurring exons 45-55 in-frame deletion mutation is associated with an asymptomatic or remarkably mild phenotype as compared to shorter in-frame deletions within this region. As such, exons 45-55 skipping is a promising therapeutic approach to treat a wider group of DMD patients.

Methods & clinical development,"Micro-dystrophin gene replacement therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are currently in clinical trials, but have not been thoroughly investigated for their efficacy on cardiomyopathy progression to heart failure. We previously validated Fiona/dystrophin-utrophin-deficient (dko) mice as a DMD cardiomyopathy model that progresses to reduced ejection fraction indicative of heart failure. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector delivery of an early generation micro-dystrophin prevented cardiac pathology and functional decline through 1 year of age in this new model. We now show that gene therapy using a micro-dystrophin optimized for skeletal muscle efficacy (AAV-μDys5), and which is currently in a clinical trial, is able to fully prevent cardiac pathology and cardiac strain abnormalities and maintain normal (>45%) ejection fraction through 18 months of age in Fiona/dko mice. Early treatment with AAV-μDys5 prevents inflammation and fibrosis in Fiona/dko hearts. Collagen in cardiac fibrotic scars becomes more tightly packed from 12 to 18 months in Fiona/dko mice, but the area of fibrosis containing tenascin C does not change. Increased tight collagen correlates with unexpected improvements in Fiona/dko whole-heart function that maintain impaired cardiac strain and strain rate.

DMD is caused by mutations in the gene that codes for dystrophin, which is required for muscle membrane stabilization. The loss of functional dystrophin causes muscle degradation that leads to weakness, loss of ambulation, cardiac and respiratory complications, and eventually, premature death. Therapies to treat DMD have advanced in the past decade, with treatments in clinical trials and four exon-skipping drugs receiving conditional Food and Drug Administration approval. However, to date, no treatment has provided long-term correction. Gene editing has emerged as a promising approach to treating DMD. There is a wide range of tools, including meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and, most notably, RNA-guided enzymes from the bacterial adaptive immune system clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Although challenges in using CRISPR for gene therapy in humans still abound, including safety and efficiency of delivery, the future for CRISPR gene editing for DMD is promising.

This has hindered treatment development and complicated interpretation of drug effects in clinical trials.
We hypothesized that a multivariate combination of early-age clinical outcome measurements can explain differential disease progression.
Data on boys with DMD (ages 4-<10 years), both treated with steroidal anti-inflammatories and untreated, were obtained from CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study (n = 209) and vamorolone VBP15-002/003/LTE (n = 46) studies. Velocities from three timed function tests (TFTs; stand from supine, run/walk 10 meters, and climb 4 stairs) were simultaneously modeled in a longitudinal latent class analysis.
Three classes of differentially progressing early age DMD motor trajectories were identified. Quicker decline/progression was associated with lower baseline TFT velocities, earlier loss of ability to finish a TFT, and lower predicted velocities. Earlier substantial steroid exposure was associated with greater TFT velocities while the moderate progression class was observed to have the largest difference in performance between boys treated early with steroids vs. not. Sample size calculations with the class showing the largest treatment response showed a large reduction in required sample size as compared to using summaries from all participants. Gene mutations were also investigated in post-hoc analyses, with mutations near the beginning of the DMD gene (Dp427 absent and Dp140/Dp71 present) found to be enriched in the slowest progressing class.
This study provides insight into the variation in DMD progression through a latent class analysis.

Neurology,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 results from an RNA gain-of-function mutation, in which DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats exert deleterious effects. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) provide a promising approach to treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 because they reduce toxic RNA levels. We aimed to investigate the safety of baliforsen (ISIS 598769), an ASO targeting DMPK mRNA.
In this dose-escalation phase 1/2a trial, adults aged 20-55 years with myotonic dystrophy type 1 were enrolled at seven tertiary referral centres in the USA and randomly assigned via an interactive web or phone response system to subcutaneous injections of baliforsen 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg, or placebo (6:2 randomisation at each dose level), or to baliforsen 400 mg or 600 mg, or placebo (10:2 randomisation at each dose level), on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Sponsor personnel directly involved with the trial, participants, and all study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary outcome measure was safety in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug up to day 134. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02312011), and is complete.
Between Dec 12, 2014, and Feb 22, 2016, 49 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to baliforsen 100 mg (n=7, one patient not dosed), 200 mg (n=6), 300 mg (n=6), 400 mg (n=10), 600 mg (n=10), or placebo (n=10). The safety population comprised 48 participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 36 (95%) of 38 participants assigned to baliforsen and nine (90%) of ten participants assigned to placebo. Aside from injection-site reactions, common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (baliforsen: ten [26%] of 38 participants; placebo: four [40%] of ten participants), contusion (baliforsen: seven [18%] of 38; placebo: one [10%] of ten), and nausea (baliforsen: six [16%] of 38; placebo: two [20%] of ten). Most adverse events (baliforsen: 425 [86%] of 494; placebo: 62 [85%] of 73) were mild in severity. One participant (baliforsen 600 mg) developed transient thrombocytopenia considered potentially treatment related. Baliforsen concentrations in skeletal muscle increased with dose.
Baliforsen was generally well tolerated. However, skeletal muscle drug concentrations were below levels predicted to achieve substantial target reduction. These results support the further investigation of ASOs as a therapeutic approach for myotonic dystrophy type 1, but suggest improved drug delivery to muscle is needed.

Disease progression models for the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), a functional measurement widely used to assess outcomes in clinical trials, were developed using a longitudinal population modeling approach. The relationship between NSAA total score over time, loss of ambulation, and potential covariates that may influence disease progression were evaluated. Data included individual participant observations from an internal placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial and from the external natural history database for male patients with DMD obtained through the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG). A modified indirect response model for NSAA joined to a loss of ambulation (LOA) time-to-event model described the data well. Age was used as the independent variable because ambulatory function is known to vary with age. The NSAA and LOA models were linked using the dissipation rate constant parameter from the NSAA model by including the parameter as a covariate on the hazard equation for LOA. No covariates were identified. The model was then used as a simulation tool to explore various clinical trial design scenarios.

Movement behavior was assessed while the participant engaged in everyday activities using a 17-sensor bodysuit during three clinical visits over the course of 12 months. We first defined new movement behavioral fingerprints capable of distinguishing DMD from controls. Then, we used machine learning algorithms that combined the behavioral fingerprints to make cross-sectional and longitudinal disease course predictions, which outperformed predictions derived from currently used clinical assessments. Finally, using Bayesian optimization, we constructed a behavioral biomarker, termed the KineDMD ethomic biomarker, which is derived from daily-life behavioral data and whose value progresses with age in an S-shaped sigmoid curve form.

BMD presents with reduced severity compared with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the allelic disorder of complete dystrophin deficiency. Significant therapeutic advancements have been made in DMD, including four FDA-approved drugs. BMD, however, is understudied and underserved-there are no drugs and few clinical trials. Discordance in therapeutic efforts is due in part to lack of a BMD mouse model which would enable greater understanding of disease and de-risk potential therapeutics before first-in-human trials. Importantly, a BMD mouse model is becoming increasingly critical as emerging DMD dystrophin restoration therapies aim to convert a DMD genotype into a BMD phenotype.
We use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate bmx (Becker muscular dystrophy, X-linked) mice, which express an in-frame ~40 000 bp deletion of exons 45-47 in the murine Dmd gene, reproducing the most common BMD patient mutation. Here, we characterize muscle pathogenesis using molecular and histological techniques and then test skeletal muscle and cardiac function using muscle function assays and echocardiography.
Overall, bmx mice present with significant muscle weakness and heart dysfunction versus wild-type (WT) mice, despite a substantial improvement in pathology over dystrophin-null mdx52 mice. bmx mice show impaired motor function in grip strength (-39%, P < 0.0001), wire hang (P = 0.0025), and in vivo as well as ex vivo force assays. In aged bmx, echocardiography reveals decreased heart function through reduced fractional shortening (-25%, P = 0.0036). Additionally, muscle-specific serum CK is increased >60-fold (P < 0.0001), indicating increased muscle damage. Histologically, bmx muscles display increased myofibre size variability (minimal Feret's diameter: P = 0.0017) and centrally located nuclei indicating degeneration/regeneration (P < 0.0001). bmx muscles also display dystrophic pathology; however, levels of the following parameters are moderate in comparison with mdx52: inflammatory/necrotic foci (P < 0.0001), collagen deposition (+1.4-fold, P = 0.0217), and sarcolemmal damage measured by intracellular IgM (P = 0.0878). Like BMD patients, bmx muscles show reduced dystrophin protein levels (~20-50% of WT), whereas Dmd transcript levels are unchanged. At the molecular level, bmx muscles express increased levels of inflammatory genes, inflammatory miRNAs and fibrosis genes.
The bmx mouse recapitulates BMD disease phenotypes with histological, molecular and functional deficits. Importantly, it can inform both BMD pathology and DMD dystrophin restoration therapies.

In one such example, antisense morpholinos were approved to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) based on measurement of shortened dystrophin in skeletal muscle biopsies as a surrogate biomarker. New, promising therapeutics for DMD include AAV gene therapy to restore another form of dystrophin termed mini- or microdystrophin. AAV-microdystrophins are currently in clinical trials but have yet to be accepted by regulatory agencies as reasonably likely surrogate endpoints. To evaluate microdystrophin expression as a reasonably likely surrogate endpoint for DMD, this review highlights dystrophin biology in the context of functional and clinical benefit to support the argument that microdystrophin proteins have a high probability of providing clinical benefit based on their rational design. Unlike exon-skipping based strategies, the approach of rational design allows for functional capabilities (i.e. quality) of the protein to be maximized with every patient receiving the same optimized microdystrophin. Therefore, the presence of rationally designed microdystrophin in a muscle biopsy is likely to predict clinical benefit and is consequently a strong candidate for a surrogate endpoint analysis to support accelerated approval.",,,,2022-12-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A subset of NDDs exhibit CNS dysfunction and muscle degeneration, as observed in Gangliosidosis 1 (GM1) and late stages of PD. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of diseases in which patients show primary progressive muscle weaknesses, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Pompe disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NDDs and NMDs typically have a genetic component, which affects the physiological functioning of critical cellular processes, leading to pathogenesis. Currently, there is no cure or efficient treatment for most of these diseases. More than 200 clinical trials have been completed or are currently underway in order to establish safety, tolerability, and efficacy of promising gene therapy approaches. Thus, gene therapy-based therapeutics, including viral or non-viral delivery, are very appealing for the treatment of NDDs and NMDs. In particular, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are an attractive option for gene therapy for NDDs and NMDs. However, limitations have been identified after systemic delivery, including the suboptimal capacity of these therapies to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), degradation of the particles during the delivery, high reactivity of the patient's immune system during the treatment, and the potential need for redosing. To circumvent these limitations, several preclinical and clinical studies have suggested intrathecal (IT) delivery to target the CNS and peripheral organs via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF administration can vastly improve the delivery of small molecules and drugs to the brain and spinal cord as compared to systemic delivery. Here, we review AAV biology and vector design elements, different therapeutic routes of administration, and highlight CSF delivery as an attractive route of administration. We discuss the different aspects of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as pathogenesis, the landscape of mutations, and the biological processes associated with the disease. We also describe the hallmarks of NDDs and NMDs as well as discuss current therapeutic approaches and clinical progress in viral and non-viral gene therapy and enzyme replacement strategies for those diseases.",,,,2022-12-24,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Gene therapies have become a reality for several neuromuscular disorders. Exon-skipping and (in Europe) ribosomal read-through approaches are currently available to a subset of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Microdystrophin gene replacement has shown promise and is nearing the final stages of clinical trials. Numerous gene-based therapies for other muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are progressing toward approval as well.
Muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogenous group of hereditary muscle disorders. Confirming a diagnosis with genetic testing is not only critical for guiding management, but also an actual prerequisite for current and future gene therapies. Recessive loss-of-function or dominant haploinsufficiency disorders may be treated with gene replacement strategies, whereas dominant negative and toxic gain-of-function disorders are best addressed with a variety of knockdown approaches. It is important to recognize that many therapeutics are mutation specific and will only benefit a subset of individuals with a specific disease.",,,,2022-12-21,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The skeletal muscle pathology of DMD patients includes immune cell infiltration and inflammatory cascades. There are several strategies to restore dystrophin in skeletal muscles of patients, including exon skipping and gene therapy. There is some evidence that dystrophin restoration leads to a reduction in immune cells, but dystrophin epitopes expressed in revertant fibers or following genome editing, cell therapy, or microdystrophin delivery after adeno-associated viral gene therapy may elicit T cell production in patients. This may affect the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention, and potentially lead to serious adverse events. To confirm and extend previous studies, we performed annual enzyme- linked immunospot interferon-gamma assays on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 77 pediatric boys with DMD recruited into a natural history study, 69 of whom (89.6%) were treated with corticosteroids. T cell responses to dystrophin were quantified using a total of 368 peptides spanning the entire dystrophin protein, organized into nine peptide pools. Peptide mapping pools were used to further localize the immune response in one positive patient. Six (7.8%) patients had a T cell-mediated immune response to dystrophin at at least one time point. All patients who had a positive result had been treated with corticosteroids, either prednisolone or prednisone. Our results show that ∼8% of DMD individuals in our cohort have a pre-existing T cell-mediated immune response to dystrophin, despite steroid treatment. Although these responses are relatively low level, this information should be considered a useful immunological baseline before undertaking clinical trials and future DMD studies.

Recently, there has been renewed interest specifically in drugs that ameliorate muscle inflammation in DMD patients. The DE50-MD dog is a model of DMD that closely mimics the human DMD phenotype. We quantified inflammatory proteins in serum from wild-type (WT) and DE50-MD dogs aged 3-18 months to identify biomarkers for future pre-clinical trials. Significantly higher concentrations of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF or CSF2), keratinocyte chemotactic-like (KC-like, homologous to mouse CXCL1), TNFα (or TNF), and interleukins IL2, IL6, IL7, IL8 (CXCL8), IL10, IL15 and IL18 were detected in DE50-MD serum compared to WT serum. Of these, CCL2 best differentiated the two genotypes. The relative level of CCL2 mRNA was greater in the vastus lateralis muscle of DE50-MD dogs than in that of WT dogs, and CCL2 was expressed both within and at the periphery of damaged myofibres. Serum CCL2 concentration was significantly associated with acid phosphatase staining in vastus lateralis biopsy samples in DE50-MD dogs.

The aim is to overcome the immune response against adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid itself as well as against the AAV-derived transgene.AAV is currently the most used viral vector because of its relative safety and high efficiency of gene transfer to nondividing cells. Since DMD is caused by a deficiency of dystrophin protein due to mutation or deletion in the dystrophin gene, dystrophin replacement therapy using AAV vectors carrying dystrophin as a therapeutic gene is an effective treatment as shown by animal experiments and clinical trials. Because DMD is a systemic disease, the amount of AAV vector required to achieve efficacy is impractically large. MSC have been used in combination with organ transplants due to their immunomodulatory effects.

The OPTIMISTIC clinical trial demonstrated positive and heterogenous effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on the capacity for activity and social participations in DM1 patients. Through a process of reverse engineering, this study aims to identify druggable molecular biomarkers associated with the clinical improvement in the OPTIMISTIC cohort.
Based on full blood samples collected during OPTIMISTIC, we performed paired mRNA sequencing for 27 patients before and after the CBT intervention. Linear mixed effect models were used to identify biomarkers associated with the disease-causing CTG expansion and the mean clinical improvement across all clinical outcome measures.
We identified 608 genes for which their expression was significantly associated with the CTG-repeat expansion, as well as 1176 genes significantly associated with the average clinical response towards the intervention. Remarkably, all 97 genes associated with both returned to more normal levels in patients who benefited the most from CBT. This main finding has been replicated based on an external dataset of mRNA data of DM1 patients and controls, singling these genes out as candidate biomarkers for therapy response. Among these candidate genes were DNAJB12, HDAC5, and TRIM8, each belonging to a protein family that is being studied in the context of neurological disorders or muscular dystrophies.

At the time of regulatory approval and health technology assessment (HTA), evidence of efficacy and safety of gene therapies is often uncertain. In addition, research, development, and manufacturing costs, small pools of eligible patients, and the fact that many gene therapies are administered only once means that they frequently are associated with very high ""one-off"" price points. Although only a limited number of products have been brought to market globally, hundreds of clinical trials of gene therapies, including several of monogenetic neuromuscular diseases, are currently ongoing. Over time, as more and more conditions become amendable to gene therapy, the number of transformative, high-cost treatments is likely to increase considerably. For these reasons, concerns have been raised regarding the suitability of current health policy systems, including HTA frameworks, in ensuring appropriate access to these therapeutic innovations while simultaneously safeguarding value for taxpayers' money, as well as affordability and sustainability.

36310439,The Implication of Hinge 1 and Hinge 4 in Micro-Dystrophin Gene Therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, dystrophin associated glycoprotein complex, hinges, mdx, micro-dystrophin, muscle function",Human gene therapy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle disease caused by dystrophin deficiency. Dystrophin consists of the amino terminus, central rod domain with 24 spectrin-like repeats and four hinges (H), cysteine-rich domain, and carboxyl terminus. Several highly abbreviated micro-dystrophins (μDys) are currently in clinical trials. They all carry H1 and H4. In this study, we investigated whether these two hinges are essential for μDy function in murine DMD models. Three otherwise identical μDys were engineered to contain H1 and/or H4 and were named H1/H4 (with both H1 and H4), ΔH1 (without H1), and ΔH4 (without H4). These constructs were packaged in adeno-associated virus serotype-9 and delivered to the tibialis anterior muscle of 3-month-old male mdx4cv mice (1E12 vector genome particles/muscle). Three months later, we detected equivalent μDys expression in total muscle lysate. However, only H1/H4 and ΔH1 showed correct sarcolemmal localization. ΔH4 mainly existed as sarcoplasmic aggregates. H1/H4 and ΔH1, but not ΔH4, fully restored the dystrophin-associated protein complex and significantly improved the specific muscle force. Eccentric contraction-induced force decline was best protected by H1/H4, followed by ΔH1, but not by ΔH4. Next, we compared H1/H4 and ΔH1 in 6-week-old male mdx mice by intravenous injection (1E13 vector genome particles/mouse). Four months postinjection, H1/H4 significantly outperformed ΔH1 in extensor digitorum longus muscle force measurements but two constructs yielded comparable electrocardiography improvements. We conclude that H4 is essential for μDys function and H1 facilitates force production. Our findings will help develop next-generation μDys gene therapy.",,,,2022-11-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Domagrozumab, a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody, binds myostatin and inhibits activity. Domagrozumab was investigated in a phase II trial (NCT02310763) as a potential treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling is vital in clinical trial design, particularly for determining dosing regimens in pediatric populations. This analysis sought to establish the PK/PD relationship between free domagrozumab and total myostatin concentrations in pediatric patients with DMD using a prior semimechanistic model developed from a phase I study in healthy adult volunteers (NCT01616277) and following inclusion of phase II data. The refined model was developed using a multiple-step approach comprising structural, random effects, and covariate model development; assessment of model adequacy (goodness-of-fit); and predictive performance. Differences in PKs/PDs between healthy adult volunteers and pediatric patients with DMD were quantitatively accounted for and evaluated by predicting myostatin coverage (the percentage of myostatin bound by domagrozumab). The final model parameter estimates and semimechanistic target-mediated drug disposition structure sufficiently described both domagrozumab and myostatin concentrations in pediatric patients with DMD, and most population parameters were comparable with the prior model (in healthy adult volunteers). Predicted myostatin coverage for phase II patients with DMD was consistently > 90%. Baseline serum myostatin was ~ 65% lower than in healthy adult volunteers. This study provides insights into the regulation of myostatin in healthy adults and pediatric patients with DMD.

We aimed to describe the experience of LVR by boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), their families, and healthcare providers (HCPs), as well as to identify the barriers and facilitators to LVR use.
This multicenter, qualitative study evaluated boys with DMD (n = 11) who used twice-daily LVR as part of a randomized controlled trial, as well as their parents (n = 11), and HCPs involved in the clinical use of LVR (n = 9). Semistructured interviews were conducted to identify participants' understanding of LVR therapy and their beliefs, barriers and facilitators to its use. Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive approach. A subanalysis compared adherent and nonadherent children.
Seven themes were identified related to participants' beliefs and experiences with LVR: emotional impact, adaptation to LVR, perceived benefits of LVR, routine, family engagement, clinical resources, and equipment-related factors. Strategies to improve adherence were also identified, including education, reinforcement and demonstration of LVR benefit, as well as clinician support. There were no thematic differences between adherent and nonadherent children.
Despite the benefits of LVR and positive experiences with it by many families, there remain barriers to adherence to treatment.

This leads to an expansion of the phenotypic spectrum, whereby new or previously less relevant disease manifestations in different organ systems gain more importance. The care of adolescents and young adults with neuromuscular diseases, therefore, requires increasingly close interdisciplinary collaboration within neuromuscular centers.
How can the transition process from pediatric to adult care be structured so that the individual disciplines are efficiently integrated into the complex treatment and care process, and the patients' quality of life is improved?
A structured transition process was established at the University Hospital in Essen, Germany. Exemplarily, a comparable care concept was developed based on Pompe disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and juvenile myasthenia gravis comprising four elements: (1) With the introduction of cross-department standard operating procedures, the logistical processes, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic measures, are uniformly coordinated, and the transition process is bindingly defined. (2) To ensure a seamless transition, young patients are seen with their parents during joint consultations before they reach their 17th birthday. This creates an opportunity for patients to get to know the subsequent department structure and build a lasting relationship of trust. (3) A quarterly ""transition board"" regularly brings together the participating disciplines from pediatric and adult care systems for a case-related interdisciplinary exchange and continuous optimization of the transition process. (4) A cross-department ""Transition Database"", in which medical findings and parameters are recorded, was implemented as a common information platform and database.

To determine if vamorolone, a structurally unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is able to retain efficacy while reducing safety concerns with use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled 24-week clinical trial, conducted from June 29, 2018, to February 24, 2021, with 24 weeks of follow-up. This was a multicenter study (33 referral centers in 11 countries) and included boys 4 to younger than 7 years of age with genetically confirmed DMD not previously treated with corticosteroids.
The study included 4 groups: placebo; prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg per day; vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day; and vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day.
Study outcomes monitored (1) efficacy, which included motor outcomes (primary: time to stand from supine velocity in the vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, group vs placebo; secondary: time to stand from supine velocity [vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day], 6-minute walk distance, time to run/walk 10 m [vamorolone, 2 and 6 mg/kg per day]; exploratory: NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment, time to climb 4 stairs) and (2) safety, which included growth, bone biomarkers, and a corticotropin (ACTH)-challenge test.
Among the 133 boys with DMD enrolled in the study (mean [SD] age, 5.4 [0.9] years), 121 were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and 114 completed the 24-week treatment period. The trial met the primary end point for change from baseline to week 24 time to stand velocity for vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day (least-squares mean [SE] velocity, 0.05 [0.01] m/s vs placebo -0.01 [0.01] m/s; 95% CI, 0.02-0.10; P = .002) and the first 4 sequential secondary end points: time to stand velocity, vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; 6-minute walk test, vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; 6-minute walk test, vamorolone, 2 mg/kg per day, vs placebo; and time to run/walk 10 m velocity, vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, vs placebo. Height percentile declined in prednisone-treated (not vamorolone-treated) participants (change from baseline [SD]: prednisone, -1.88 [8.81] percentile vs vamorolone, 6 mg/kg per day, +3.86 [6.16] percentile; P = .02). Bone turnover markers declined with prednisone but not with vamorolone. Boys with DMD at baseline showed low ACTH-stimulated cortisol and high incidence of adrenal insufficiency. All 3 treatment groups led to increased adrenal insufficiency.
In this pivotal randomized clinical trial, vamorolone was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of boys with DMD over a 24-week treatment period. Vamorolone may be a safer alternative than prednisone in this disease, in which long-term corticosteroid use is the standard of care.

Multiple opportunities are taking shape, able to remove defective protein by silencing RNA (e.g., Inclisiran targets mRNA of protein PCSK9, permitting a longer half-life of LDL receptors in heterozygous familial hypercholesteremia), by arresting mRNA translation (i.e., Fomivirsen that binds to UL123-RNA and blocks the translation into IE2 protein in CMV-retinitis), or by reactivating modified functional protein (e.g., Eteplirsen able to restore a functional shorter dystrophin by skipping the exon 51 in Duchenne muscular dystrophy) or a not very functional protein. In this last case, the use of ASOs permits modifying the expression of specific proteins by modulating splicing of specific pre-RNAs (e.g., Nusinersen acts on the splicing of exon 7 in SMN2 mRNA normally not expressed; it is used for spinal muscular atrophy) or by downregulation of transcript levels (e.g., Inotersen acts on the transthryretin mRNA to reduce its expression; it is prescribed for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis) in order to restore the biochemical/physiological condition and ameliorate quality of life. In the era of precision medicine, recently, an experimental splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotide, Milasen, was designed and used to treat an 8-year-old girl affected by a rare, fatal, progressive form of neurodegenerative disease leading to death during adolescence.

To gain a better understanding of the longitudinal utility of the NSAA, we evaluated NSAA data from a phase II trial of 120 patients with DMD treated with domagrozumab or placebo.
The NSAA exploratory analyses included assessment of individual skills gained/lost, total skills gained/lost, cumulative loss of function, and the impact of transient loss of function due to a temporary disability on NSAA total score (temporary zero score).
There was no significant difference in the total number of NSAA skills gained (mean 1.41 and 1.04, respectively; p = 0.3314) or lost (3.90 vs. 5.0; p = 0.0998) between domagrozumab- vs. placebo-treated patients at week 49. However, domagrozumab-treated patients were less likely to lose the ability to perform a NSAA item (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.98, p = 0.029) over 48-weeks vs. placebo-treated patients. When temporary zero scores were changed to ""not obtainable"" (8 values from 7 patients), domagrozumab-treated patients scored higher on the NSAA total score versus placebo-treated patients (difference at week 49: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.1-3.9, p = 0.0359).
These exploratory analyses reveal additional approaches to interpreting the NSAA data beyond just change in NSAA total score. These observations also highlight the importance of reporting items as ""not obtainable"" for a patient with a temporary/transient physical disability that impacts their ability to perform the NSAA test.

Interestingly, a dysregulated expression of muscle-specific microRNAs (miRNAs), called myomirs, has been found in patients affected with muscular dystrophies, although few studies have been conducted in BMD. We analysed the serum expression levels of a subset of myomirs in a cohort of 29 ambulant individuals affected by BMD and further classified according to the degree of alterations at muscle biopsy and in 11 age-matched healthy controls. We found a significant upregulation of serum miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b and miR-206 in our cohort of BMD patients, supporting the role of these miRNAs in the pathophysiology of the disease, and we identified serum cut-off levels discriminating patients from healthy controls, confiming the potential of circulating miRNAs as promising noninvasive biomarkers. Moreover, serum levels of miR-133b were found to be associated with fibrosis at muscle biopsy and with patients' motor performances, suggesting that miR-133b might be a useful prognostic marker for BMD patients.

Differentiating features include lipid solubility, pharmacokinetics, changes in gene expression profiles, affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, and impact on glucose metabolism. Evidence from randomized clinical trials, prospective studies, meta-analyses, and post-hoc analyses suggests that patients receiving deflazacort experience similar or slower rates of functional decline compared with those receiving prednisone/prednisolone.

Twenty-two non-ambulant DMD patients (range 8.6-24.1 years) and 14 healthy controls (HC; range 9.5-25.4 years) were studied at baseline and 16 patients at 12 months using Leap Motion to quantify wrist/hand active range of motion (aROM) and a Kinect sensor for reached volume with Ability Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), Functional Workspace (FWS) summed distance to seven upper extremity body points, and trunk compensation (KinectTC). PUL 2.0 was performed in patients only. A stepwise approach assessed quality control, construct validity, reliability, concurrent validity, longitudinal change and patient perception.
Leap Motion aROM distinguished patients and HCs for supination, radial deviation and wrist flexion (range p = 0.006 to <0.001). Reliability was low and the manufacturer's hand model did not match the sensor's depth images. ACTIVE differed between patients and HCs (p < 0.001), correlated with PUL (rho = 0.76), and decreased over time (p = 0.030) with a standardized response mean (SRM) of -0.61.

KinectTC differed between patients and HCs (p < 0.01), but correlated insufficiently with PUL (rho = -0.69).
Only ACTIVE qualified as potential outcome measure in non-ambulant DMD patients, although the SRM was below the commonly used threshold of 0.8.

The aim of this prospective study was to determine rate of progressive decline in left ventricular (LV) function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) over 5 years.
Short axis cine and grid tagged images of the LV were acquired in individuals with DMD (n = 59; age = 5.3-18.0 years) yearly, and healthy controls at baseline (n = 16, age = 6.0-18.3 years) on a 3 T MRI scanner. Grid-tagged images were analyzed for composite circumferential strain (ℇcc%) and ℇcc% in six mid LV segments. Cine images were analyzed for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV mass (LVM), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), LV atrioventricular plane displacement (LVAPD), and circumferential uniformity ratio estimate (CURE). LVM, EDV, and ESV were normalized to body surface area for a normalized index of LVM (LVMI), EDV (EDVI) and ESV (ESVI).
At baseline, LV ℇcc% was significantly worse in DMD compared to controls and five of the six mid LV segments demonstrated abnormal strain in DMD. Longitudinal measurements revealed that ℇcc% consistently declined in individuals with DMD with the inferior segments being more affected. LVEF progressively declined between 3 to 5 years post baseline visit. In a multivariate analysis, the use of cardioprotective drugs trended towards positively impacting cardiac measures while loss of ambulation and baseline age were associated with negative impact.

Childhood and adult-onset muscular dystrophies include dystrophinopathies, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. Traditionally, muscle biopsy and histopathology along with special pathology techniques such as immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting were used for the diagnosis of muscular dystrophies. However, recent advances in molecular genetic testing, especially the next-generation sequencing technology, have revolutionized the diagnosis of muscular dystrophies. Identification of the underlying genetic basis helps in appropriate management and prognostication of the affected individual and genetic counseling of the family. In addition, identification of the exact disease-causing mutations is necessary for accurate prenatal genetic testing and carrier testing, to prevent recurrence in the family. Mutation identification is also essential for initiating mutation-specific therapies (which have been developed recently, especially for Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and for enrolment of patients into ongoing therapeutic clinical trials. The 'genetic testing first' approach has now become the norm in most centers.

Molecular diagnosis is the standard diagnostic tool for DMD. This study aimed to investigate disease progression and genetic patterns in Iranian ambulant boys and to find the correlation between genotypes and motor function phenotypes.
This study was performed on 152 DMD patients. Clinical history, including the disease phenotype, steroid therapy, and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score, was taken for all the patients. Molecular diagnoses were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and next-generation sequencing tests.
A total of 152 Iranian DMD patients were examined in this study. The mean age at the time of disease onset was 4.04 ± 2.00 years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 5.05 ± 2.08 years.

35482633,Bayesian modeling and simulation to inform rare disease drug development early decision-making: Application to Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,PloS one,"Rare disease clinical trials are constrained to small sample sizes and may lack placebo-control, leading to challenges in drug development. This paper proposes a Bayesian model-based framework for early go/no-go decision making in rare disease drug development, using Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as an example. Early go/no-go decisions were based on projections of long-term functional outcomes from a Bayesian model-based analysis of short-term trial data informed by prior knowledge based on 6MWT natural history literature data in DMD patients. Frequentist hypothesis tests were also applied as a reference analysis method. A number of combinations of hypothetical trial designs, drug effects and cohort comparison methods were assessed. The proposed Bayesian model-based framework was superior to the frequentist method for making go/no-go decisions across all trial designs and cohort comparison methods in DMD. The average decision accuracy rates across all trial designs for the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods were 45.8 and 8.98%, respectively. A decision accuracy rate of at least 50% was achieved for 42 and 7% of the trial designs under the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods, respectively. The frequentist method was limited to the short-term trial data only, while the Bayesian methods were informed with both the short-term data and prior information. The specific results of the DMD case study were limited due to incomplete specification of individual-specific covariates in the natural history literature data and should be reevaluated using a full natural history dataset. These limitations aside, the framework presented provides a proof of concept for the utility of Bayesian model-based methods for decision making in rare disease trials.",,,,2022-04-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To bridge the gap between preclinical and therapeutic evaluation studies, we have generated a rat model for DMD that carries an exon 52 deletion (R-DMDdel52) causing a complete lack of dystrophin protein. Here we show that R-DMDdel52 animals recapitulated human DMD pathophysiological trajectory more faithfully than the mdx mouse model. We report that R-DMDdel52 rats displayed progressive and severe skeletal muscle loss associated with fibrotic deposition, fat infiltration and fibre type switch. Early fibrosis was also apparent in the cardiac muscle. These histological modifications led to severe muscle, respiratory and cardiac functional impairments leading to premature death around 1 year. Moreover, DMD muscle exhibited systemic inflammation with a mixed M1/M2 phenotype. A comparative single cell RNAseq analysis of the diaphragm muscle was performed, revealing cellular populations alteration and molecular modifications in all muscle cell types. We show that DMD fibroadipogenic progenitors produced elevated levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, a glycoprotein responsible for modulating homeostasis of extracellular matrix, and whose increased concentration correlated with muscle fibrosis both in R-DMDdel52 rats and human patients. Fibrosis is a component of tissue remodelling impacting the whole musculature of DMD patients, at the tissue level but most importantly at the functional level. We therefore propose that this specific biomarker can optimize the prognostic monitoring of functional improvement of patients included in clinical trials.",,,,2022-04-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The Duchenne Video Assessment (DVA) measures patient ease of movement through identification of compensatory movement patterns. The DVA directs caregivers to video record patients performing specific movement tasks at home using a secure mobile application, and DVA-certified physical therapists (PTs) score the videos using scorecards with prespecified compensatory movement criteria. The goal of this study was to develop and refine the DVA scorecards.
To develop the initial scorecards, 4 PTs collaboratively created compensatory movement lists for each task, and researchers structured the lists into scorecards. A 2-round modified Delphi process was used to gather expert opinion on the understandability, comprehensiveness, and clinical meaningfulness of the compensatory movements on the scorecards. Eight PTs who had evaluated ≥50 patients with DMD and participated in ≥10 DMD clinical trials were recruited for the panel. In Round 1, panelists evaluated compensatory movement criteria understandability via questionnaire and tested the scorecards. In Round 2, panelists participated in an in-person meeting to discuss areas of disagreement from Round 1 and reach consensus (≥75% agreement) on all revisions to the scorecards.
During the Round 1 revisions to the scorecards, there were 67 changes (44%) to the wording of 153 original compensatory movement criteria and 3 criteria were removed.

MRI scans of the thigh to measure muscle volume, muscle volume index (MVI), fat fraction, and T2 relaxation time were obtained at baseline and at weeks 17, 33, 49, and 97 as per protocol. These quantitative MRI measurements appeared to be sensitive and objective biomarkers for evaluating disease progression, with significant changes observed in muscle volume, MVI, and T2 mapping measures over time. To further explore the utility of quantitative MRI measures as biomarkers to inform longer term functional changes in this cohort, a regression analysis was performed and demonstrated that muscle volume, MVI, T2 mapping measures, and fat fraction assessment were significantly correlated with longer term changes in four-stair climb times and North Star Ambulatory Assessment functional scores. Finally, less favorable baseline measures of MVI, fat fraction of the muscle bundle, and fat fraction of lean muscle were significant risk factors for loss of ambulation over a 2-year monitoring period.

Comparisons to external controls, however, face risks of bias due to differences in outcomes between trial and RWD/NHD settings. To assess this bias empirically, we conducted a multi-institution study comparing mean 48-week changes in North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score between trial placebo arms and RWD/NHD sources, with and without adjustment for baseline prognostic factors. Analyses used data from three placebo arms (235 48-week intervals, N = 235 patients) and three RWD/NHD sources (348 intervals, N = 202 patients). Differences in mean ΔNSAA between placebo arms and RWD/NHD sources were small before adjustment (-1.2 units, 95% CI: [-2.0 -0.5]) and were attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment (0.1 units (95% CI: [-0.6, 0.8]). Results were similar whether adjusting using multivariable regression or propensity score matching.

Although exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are clinically approved and can correct DMD, insufficient muscle delivery limits efficacy. If AO activity can be enhanced by safe dietary supplements, clinical trials for efficacy can be undertaken rapidly to benefit patients. We showed previously that intravenous glycine enhanced phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) delivery to peripheral muscles in mdx mice. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of oral glycine and metformin with intravenous PMO enhances PMO activity, dystrophin restoration, extends lifespan, and improves body-wide function and phenotypic rescue of dystrophin /utrophin double knock-out (DKO) mice without any overt adverse effects. The DKO mice treated with the combination without altering the approved administration protocol of PMO show improved cardio-respiratory and behavioral functions. Metformin and glycine individually are ineffective in DMD patients, but the combination of PMO with clinically-approved oral glycine and metformin might improve the efficacy of the treatment also in DMD patients.

Neuromuscular diseases have thus become the pacemaker of this form of therapy for the whole of neurology.
This article describes the principles of precision gene therapy for neurogenetic diseases using examples of neuromuscular diseases.
Various strategies of gene therapy have become established and are being tested in preclinical and clinical trials and evaluated as approved forms for long-term efficacy. The aim of every gene therapy is the modification or introduction of the target gene with initiation of a degradation of dysfunctional proteins. Various techniques, such as gene transfer, gene substitution or gene editing in vivo and ex vivo are now usable. For example, a modification of the pre-mRNA using antisense oligonucleotides or RNA interference (siRNA) can be used for exon skipping. An initiation of gene expression to produce the target protein can be based on a modification of the DNA by means of gene replacement, cell-based therapy (iPS cells), regulation by compensatory proteins or pharmacological treatment with so-called small molecules. Each method has advantages and complex disadvantages that must be individually evaluated. Phenotypic peculiarities of a rare disease often only become apparent through specific translational therapy. It is already becoming obvious that a very early point in timing of gene therapy is probably the most effective. Newborn screening is therefore gaining additional importance as early diagnosis can achieve the best possible success of therapies, possibly even preventively.
HINTERGRUND: In den letzten Jahren ist aus der theoretischen Hoffnung Realität geworden – erste hereditäre neuromuskuläre Erkrankungen sind ursächlich behandelbar geworden. Neuromuskuläre Erkrankungen sind damit zum Schrittmacher dieser Therapieform für die Gesamtneurologie geworden.
Dieser Beitrag beschreibt Prinzipen der Präzisionsgentherapie für neurogenetische Erkrankungen an Beispielen neuromuskulärer Erkrankungen.
Unterschiedliche Strategien der Gentherapie haben sich etabliert und sind in präklinischen und klinischen Studienphasen sowie in zugelassener Form in der Langzeitevaluation. Ziel jeder Gentherapie ist die Modifikation oder Einführung des Zielgens mit Initiierung einer Degradation dysfunktionaler Proteine. Unterschiedliche Techniken wie Gentransfer, Gensubstitution oder Geneditierung in vivo und ex vivo sind nun nutzbar. So kann eine Modifikation der Prä-mRNA mittels Antisense-Oligonukleotiden oder die RNA-Interferenz (siRNA) z. B. für ein Exonskipping genutzt werden. Eine Initiierung der Genexpression zur Produktion des Zielproteins kann auf einer Modifikation der DNA mittels Genersatz, zellbasierter Therapien (iPS-Zellen), Regulation durch kompensatorische Proteine oder pharmakologische Therapie mit sog. „small molecules“ beruhen. Jede Methode hat Vorteile und komplexe Nachteile, die individuell evaluiert werden müssen. Oft treten phänotypische Besonderheiten einer seltenen Erkrankung erst durch deren spezifische translationale Therapie hervor. Schon heute zeichnet sich ab, dass ein sehr früher Zeitpunkt für eine Gentherapie wohl der effektivste ist. Daher bekommt das Neugeborenenscreening einen neuen zusätzlichen Stellenwert, da durch die frühe Diagnosestellung der bestmögliche Erfolg der Therapien ggf. sogar präventiv erreichbar wird.",,,,2022-04-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We show that FAPs from late-stage mdx mice exhibit aberrant HDAC activity and genome-wide alterations of histone acetylation that are not fully reversed by HDACi. In particular, combinatorial H3K27 and/or H3K9/14 hypo-acetylation at promoters of genes required for cell cycle activation and progression, as well as glycolysis, are associated with their downregulation in late-stage mdx FAPs. These alterations could not be reversed by HDACi, due to a general resistance to HDACi-induced H3K9/14 hyperacetylation. Conversely, H3K9/14 hyper-acetylation at promoters of Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) genes is associated with their upregulation in late-stage mdx FAPs; however, HDACi could reduce promoter acetylation and blunt SASP gene activation. These data reveal that during DMD progression FAPs develop disease-associated features reminiscent of cellular senescence, through epigenetically distinct and pharmacologically dissociable events. They also indicate that HDACi might retain anti-fibrotic effects at late stages of DMD.",,,,2022-04-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The boys were assessed for 3 years (last participant visit on October 16, 2019).
Participants were randomized to daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) (n = 65), daily deflazacort (0.90 mg/kg) (n = 65), or intermittent prednisone (0.75 mg/kg for 10 days on and then 10 days off) (n = 66).
The global primary outcome comprised 3 end points: rise from the floor velocity (in rise/seconds), forced vital capacity (in liters), and participant or parent global satisfaction with treatment measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM; score range, 0 to 100), each averaged across all study visits after baseline. Pairwise group comparisons used a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of .017.
Among the 196 boys randomized (mean age, 5.8 years [SD, 1.0 years]), 164 (84%) completed the trial. Both daily prednisone and daily deflazacort were more effective than intermittent prednisone for the primary outcome (P < .001 for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone using a global test; P = .017 for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone using a global test) and the daily regimens did not differ significantly (P = .38 for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort using a global test). The between-group differences were principally attributable to rise from the floor velocity (0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.08 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone [P = .003]; 0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.09 rise/s] for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone [P = .017]; and -0.004 rise/s [98.3% CI, -0.03 to 0.02 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort [P = .75]). The pairwise comparisons for forced vital capacity and TSQM global satisfaction subscale score were not statistically significant. The most common adverse events were abnormal behavior (22 [34%] in the daily prednisone group, 25 [38%] in the daily deflazacort group, and 24 [36%] in the intermittent prednisone group), upper respiratory tract infection (24 [37%], 19 [29%], and 24 [36%], respectively), and vomiting (19 [29%], 17 [26%], and 15 [23%]).
Among patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, treatment with daily prednisone or daily deflazacort, compared with intermittent prednisone alternating 10 days on and 10 days off, resulted in significant improvement over 3 years in a composite outcome comprising measures of motor function, pulmonary function, and satisfaction with treatment; there was no significant difference between the 2 daily corticosteroid regimens.

The impact of inflammation is profound, resulting in fibrosis of skeletal muscle, the diaphragm and heart, which contributes to muscle weakness, reduced quality of life and premature death. To date, the innate immune system has been the major focus in individuals with DMD, and our understanding of the adaptive immune system, specifically T cells, is limited. Targeting the immune system has been the focus of multiple clinical trials for DMD and is considered a vital step in the development of better treatments. However, we must first have a complete picture of the involvement of the immune systems in dystrophic muscle disease to better understand how inflammation influences disease progression and severity. This review focuses on the role of T cells in DMD, highlighting the importance of looking beyond skeletal muscle when considering how the loss of dystrophin impacts disease progression. Finally, we propose that targeting T cells is a potential novel therapeutic in the treatment of DMD.",,,,2022-03-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In 2009, a study from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) showed an average diagnosis age of 5 years among males with DMD born from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 2000. Initiatives were implemented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and patient organizations to reduce time to diagnosis. We conducted a follow-up study in a surveillance cohort born after January 1, 2000 to determine whether there has been an improvement in time to diagnosis.
We assessed the age of diagnosis among males with DMD born from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 using data collected by six US MD STARnet surveillance sites (Colorado, Iowa, western New York State, the Piedmont region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah). The analytic cohort included 221 males with definite or probable DMD diagnosis without a documented family history. We computed frequency count and percentage for categorical variables, and mean, median, and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.
The mean [median] ages in years of diagnostic milestones were: first signs, 2.7 [2.0]; first creatine kinase (CK), 4.6 [4.6]; DNA/muscle biopsy testing, 4.9 [4.8]; and time from first signs to diagnostic confirmation, 2.2 [1.4].

Between March 1, 2018, and March 31, 2020, 26 male patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were enrolled, of whom eight were randomly assigned to the CAP-1002 group and 12 to the placebo group (six were not randomised due to screening failure). In patients who had a post-treatment PUL 1.2 assessment (eight in the CAP-1002 group and 11 in the placebo group), the mean 12-month change from baseline in mid-level elbow PUL1.2 favoured CAP-1002 over placebo (percentile difference 36·2, 95% CI 12·7-59·7; difference of 2·6 points; p=0·014). Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions without long-term sequelae were observed in three patients, with one patient discontinuing therapy due to a severe allergic reaction. No other major adverse reactions were noted, and no deaths occurred.
CAP-1002 cell therapy appears to be safe and effective in reducing deterioration of upper limb function in patients with late-stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Various measures of cardiac function and structure were also improved in the CAP-1002 group compared with the placebo group. Longer-term extension studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic durability and safety of CAP-1002 beyond 12 months for the treatment of skeletal myopathy and cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Lung volume recruitment (LVR) stacks breaths to inflate the lungs to greater volumes than spontaneous effort. LVR is recommended in DMD clinical care guidelines but is not well studied. We aimed to determine whether twice-daily LVR, compared with standard of care alone, attenuates the decline in FVC at 2 years in boys with DMD.
In this multicentre, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial, boys with DMD, aged 6-16 years with FVC >30% predicted, were randomised to receive conventional treatment or conventional treatment plus manual LVR twice daily for 2 years. The primary outcome was FVC % predicted at 2 years, adjusted for baseline FVC % predicted, age and ambulatory status. Secondary outcomes included change in chest wall distensibility (maximal insufflation capacity minus FVC) and peak cough flow.

We report on how/why the study changed clinical practices in relation to the 'human' (e.g., emotional, social, existential, cultural) dimensions of living with MD.
The intervention involved regular dialogical exchanges with clinicians across the two sites, during which direct observations of the clinics' care practices were discussed and changes were planned. We drew from realist evaluation approaches to assess changes in clinical care associated with the intervention. Data sources included dialogical exchanges; clinic observations; interviews with clients, families and clinicians; and team analysis sessions.
Our evaluation suggests the clinical teams shifted their thinking and practices towards greater consideration of human aspects of living with MD including: more routinely attending to emotional, social and experiential dimensions of living with MD; reconceptualisation of risk; and considerations of affective aspects of clinical care. Not all clinicians changed their thinking and practices in the same ways, or to the same extent, and there were differences between the sites. These differences were likely due to numerous factors, including varying levels of clinician comfort with examining and shifting their own practices, and differing formal and informal clinic routines at each site.

Hence, an agent that has anabolic properties and may improve linear growth would be beneficial in this setting and therefore requires further exploration. A 5-week-old x-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mice were used as a model of DMD. They were treated with prednisolone ± GH + IGF-1 for 4 weeks and then compared to control mdx mice to allow the study of both growth and skeletal structure. GC reduced cortical bone area, bone fraction, tissue area and volume and cortical bone volume, as assessed by micro computed tomography (CT) In addition, GC caused somatic and skeletal growth retardation but improved grip strength. The addition of GH + IGF-1 therapy rescued the somatic growth retardation and induced additional improvements in grip strength (16.9% increase, P < 0.05 compared to control). There was no improvement in bone microarchitecture (assessed by micro-CT and static histomorphometry) or biomechanical properties (assessed by three-point bending).

For example, recent clinical trials have shown that a CPP attached to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) resulted in higher muscle concentration, increased exon skipping, and dystrophin production relative to another study of the PMO alone in patients of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Therefore, effective design and the study of CPPs could help enhance therapies for difficult-to-treat diseases. So far, the study of CPPs for PMO delivery has been restricted to predominantly canonical l-peptides. We hypothesized that mirror-image d-peptides could have similar PMO delivery activity as well as enhanced proteolytic stability, facilitating their characterization and quantification from biological milieu. We found that several enantiomeric peptide sequences could deliver a PMO-biotin cargo with similar activities while remaining stable against serum proteolysis. The biotin label allowed for affinity capture of fully intact PMO-peptide conjugates from whole-cell and cytosolic lysates. By profiling a mixture of these constructs in cells, we determined their relative intracellular concentrations. When combined with PMO activity, these concentrations provide a new metric for delivery efficiency, which may be useful for determining which peptide sequence to pursue in further preclinical studies.",,,,2022-02-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The most remarkable change was the posterior-only operation with all-pedicle screw fixations. With this change, operation time, blood loss, and postoperative complications decreased. Furthermore, spinal osteotomy could be performed with the pedicle screw system for severe scoliosis. S2-alar-iliac screws demonstrated favorable outcomes in terms of stability and complication, but a question remains about saving the mobile segment for sitting balance, interaction between the hip and spine, effect to the sagittal balance, and proximal junctional problem.

To this day, no cure has been found for these diseases. Different therapeutic approaches are under intensive investigation. Cellular therapy has been extensively studied for diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a debilitating disease caused by a mutation in the DMD gene, encoding for the dystrophin protein. Healthy myogenic cells transplanted into dystrophic muscles have the potential to engraft at long-term and fuse to donate their nuclei to the dystrophin-deficient myofibers, thereby restoring normal gene expression. Despite promising preclinical studies, the clinical trials had limited success so far due to many technical limitations. The recent technological advances in induced-pluripotent stem cells and genome editing opened new opportunities in this field. One of the keys to efficiently translate these new technologies into clinical benefits is to use relevant endpoints for preclinical studies. Considering that dystrophic muscles are susceptible to contraction-induced injury, the assessment of their resistance to repeated eccentric contractions is an optimal outcome to evaluate their functional recovery following cell transplantation.

Full-length Dp427 is the primary dystrophin isoform expressed in muscle and is also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Two shorter isoforms, Dp140 and Dp71, are highly expressed in the CNS. While a role for Dp140 and Dp71 on DMD CNS comorbidities is well known, relationships between mutations expected to disrupt Dp140 and Dp71 and motor outcomes are not.
Functional outcome data from 387 DMD boys aged 4-15 years were subdivided by DMD mutation expected effects on dystrophin isoform expression; Group 1 (Dp427 absent, Dp140/Dp71 present, n = 201); Group 2 (Dp427/Dp140 absent, Dp71 present, n = 152); and Group 3 (Dp427/Dp140/Dp71 absent, n = 34). Relationships between isoform group and North Star ambulatory assessment (NSAA) scores, 10 m walk/run velocities and rise time velocities were explored using regression analysis. Western blot analysis was used to study Dp427, Dp140 and Dp71 production in myogenic cells (control and DMD human), control skeletal muscle, DMD skeletal muscle from the three isoform groups and cerebral cortex from mice (wild-type and DMD models).

To investigate outcomes after 30 months of open-label vamorolone treatment.
This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted by the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group at 11 US and non-US study sites. Participants were 46 boys ages 4.5 to 7.5 years with DMD who completed the 6-month dose-finding study. Data were analyzed from July 2020 through November 2021.
Participants were enrolled in a 24-month, long-term extension (LTE) study with vamorolone dose escalated to 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/d.
Change in time-to-stand (TTSTAND) velocity from dose-finding baseline to end of LTE study was the primary outcome. Efficacy assessments included timed function tests, 6-minute walk test, and NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA). Participants with DMD treated with glucocorticoids from the Duchenne Natural History Study (DNHS) and NorthStar United Kingdom (NSUK) Network were matched and compared with participants in the LTE study receiving higher doses of vamorolone.
Among 46 boys with DMD who completed the dose-finding study, 41 boys (mean [SD] age, 5.33 [0.96] years) completed the LTE study. Among 21 participants treated with higher-dose (ie, ≥2.0 mg/kg/d) vamorolone consistently throughout the 6-month dose-finding and 24-month LTE studies with data available at 30 months, there was a decrease in mean (SD) TTSTAND velocity from baseline to 30 months (0.206 [0.070] rises/s vs 0.189 (0.124) rises/s), which was not a statistically significant change (-0.011 rises/s; CI, -0.068 to 0.046 rises/s).

Vamorolone at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/d was well tolerated, with 5 of 46 participants discontinuing prematurely and for reasons not associated with study drug. Participants in the DNHS treated with glucocorticoids had significant growth delay in comparison with participants treated with vamorolone who had stable height percentiles (0.37 percentile/mo; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.52 percentile/mo) over time.
This study found that vamorolone treatment was not associated with a change in TTSTAND velocity from baseline to 30 months among boys with DMD aged 4 to 7 years at enrollment. Vamorolone was associated with maintenance of muscle strength and function up to 30 months, similar to standard of care glucocorticoid therapy, and improved height velocity compared with growth deceleration associated with glucocorticoid treatment, suggesting that vamorolone may be an attractive candidate for treatment of DMD.

Safety concerns with this therapeutic approach include the immune response to introduced dystrophin antigens observed in some DMD patients. Recent reports highlighted microutrophin (µUtrn) as a less immunogenic functional dystrophin substitute for gene therapy. In the current study, we created a human codon-optimized µUtrn which was subjected to side-by-side characterization with previously reported mouse and human µUtrn sequences after rAAV9 intramuscular injections in mdx mice. Long-term studies with systemic delivery of rAAV9-µUtrn demonstrated robust transgene expression in muscles, with localization to the sarcolemma, functional improvement of muscle performance, decreased creatine kinase levels, and lower immunogenicity as compared to µDys. An extensive toxicity study in wild-type rats did not reveal adverse changes associated with high-dose rAAV9 administration and human codon-optimized µUtrn overexpression. Furthermore, we verified that muscle-specific promoters MHCK7 and SPc5-12 drive a sufficient level of rAAV9-µUtrn expression to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in mdx mice. Our results provide ground for taking human codon-optimized µUtrn combined with muscle-specific promoters into clinical development as safe and efficient gene therapy for DMD.",,,,2022-01-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We used data from an ongoing phase II study to provide a comprehensive characterization of a cohort of patients with BMD, and to assess correlations between histological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers with muscle function and strength.
Eligible patients were ambulatory males with BMD, aged 18 to 65 years (200 to 450 meters on 6-minute walk test). The following data were obtained: function test results, strength, fat-fraction quantification using chemical shift-encoded MRI (whole thigh and quadriceps), and fibrosis and muscle fiber area (MFA) of the brachial biceps.
Of 70 patients screened, 51 entered the study. There was substantial heterogeneity between patients in muscle morphology (histology and MRI), with high fat replacement.

Two dimensional-speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) has recently emerged as a non-invasive functional biomarker for early detection of DMD-related cardiomyopathy. This study aimed to determine, in DMD children, the existence of left ventricle (LV) dyssynchrony using 2D-STE analysis. This prospective controlled study enrolled 25 boys with DMD (mean age 11.0 ± 3.5 years) with normal LV ejection fraction and 50 age-matched controls. Three measures were performed to assess LV mechanical dyssynchrony: the opposing-wall delays (longitudinal and radial analyses), the modified Yu index, and the time-to-peak delays of each segment. Feasibility and reproducibility of 2D-STE dyssynchrony were evaluated. All three mechanical dyssynchrony criteria were significantly higher in the DMD group than in healthy subjects: (1) opposing-wall delays in basal inferoseptal to basal anterolateral segments (61.4 ± 45.3 ms vs. 18.3 ± 50.4 ms, P < 0.001, respectively) and in mid inferoseptal to mid anterolateral segments (58.6 ± 35.3 ms vs. 42.4 ± 36.4 ms, P < 0.05, respectively), (2) modified Yu index (33.3 ± 10.1 ms vs. 28.5 ± 8.1 ms, P < 0.05, respectively), and (3) most of time-to-peak values, especially in basal and mid anterolateral segments. Feasibility was excellent and reliability was moderate to excellent, with ICC values ranging from 0.49 to 0.97. Detection of LV mechanical dyssynchrony using 2D-STE analysis is an easily and reproducible method in paediatric DMD.

There are multiple ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of treating DMD with micro-dystrophins delivered by adeno-associated viruses. Future approaches entail gene editing to target the single copy of the DMD gene on the X-chromosome. The primary, near-term goal is restoration of skeletal muscle dystrophin, and for some of these treatments, the efficacy in the heart is not fully known. Here, we discuss the anticipated cardiac outcomes of dystrophin-targeted therapies, and how this information informs genomic medicine for cardiomyopathies, especially in childhood.

Research is ongoing to develop efficacious therapies, particularly for DMD. Most of the efforts, currently focusing on correcting or restoring the primary defect of MDs, are based on gene-addition, exon-skipping, stop codon read-through, and genome-editing. Although promising, most of them revealed several practical limitations. Shared knowledge in the field is that, in order to be really successful, any therapeutic approach has to rely on spared functional muscle tissue, restricting the number of patients eligible for clinical trials to the youngest and less compromised individuals. In line with this, many therapeutic strategies aim to preserve muscle tissue and function. This Review outlines the most interesting and recent studies addressing the secondary outcomes of DMD and how to better deliver the therapeutic agents.

The objective was to inform the design of DMD clinical trials by developing a disease progression model-based clinical trial simulation (CTS) platform based on measures commonly used in DMD trials. Data were integrated from past studies through the Duchenne Regulatory Science Consortium founded by the Critical Path Institute (15 clinical trials and studies, 1505 subjects, 27,252 observations). Using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach, longitudinal dynamics of five measures were modeled (NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment, forced vital capacity, and the velocities of the following three timed functional tests: time to stand from supine, time to climb 4 stairs, and 10 meter walk-run time). The models were validated on external data sets and captured longitudinal changes in the five measures well, including both early disease when function improves as a result of growth and development and the decline in function in later stages. The models can be used in the CTS platform to perform trial simulations to optimize the selection of inclusion/exclusion criteria, selection of measures, and other trial parameters.

The DMD gene is vulnerable to a variety of mutations that may cause complete loss, depletion or truncation of the protein, leading to Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Precise and reproducible dystrophin quantification is essential in characterising DMD mutations and evaluating the outcome of efforts to induce dystrophin through gene therapies. Immunofluorescence microscopy offers high sensitivity to low levels of protein expression along with confirmation of localisation, making it a critical component of quantitative dystrophin expression assays.
We have developed an automated and unbiased approach for precise quantification of dystrophin immunofluorescence in muscle sections. This methodology uses microscope images of whole-tissue sections stained for dystrophin and spectrin to measure dystrophin intensity and the proportion of dystrophin-positive coverage at the sarcolemma of each muscle fibre. To ensure objectivity, the thresholds for dystrophin and spectrin are derived empirically from non-sarcolemmal signal intensity within each tissue section. Furthermore, this approach is readily adaptable for measuring fibre morphology and other tissue markers.
Our method demonstrates the sensitivity and reproducibility of this quantification approach across a wide range of dystrophin expression in both dystrophinopathy patient and healthy control samples, with high inter-operator concordance.
As efforts to restore dystrophin expression in dystrophic muscle bring new potential therapies into clinical trials, this methodology represents a valuable tool for efficient and precise analysis of dystrophin and other muscle markers that reflect treatment efficacy.",,"Our method demonstrates the sensitivity and reproducibility of this quantification approach across a wide range of dystrophin expression in both dystrophinopathy patient and healthy control samples, with high inter-operator concordance.","As efforts to restore dystrophin expression in dystrophic muscle bring new potential therapies into clinical trials, this methodology represents a valuable tool for efficient and precise analysis of dystrophin and other muscle markers that reflect treatment efficacy.",2021-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Typically, DMD patients pass away from heart failure or respiratory failure. Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns.

In a DMD rat model, biceps femoris tissue from dystrophin-deficient rats treated with AAV9.hCK.Hopti-Dys3978.spA, an adeno-associated virus vector containing a mini-dystrophin transgene, showed a dose-dependent increase in mini-dystrophin expression at 6 months post-dose, exceeding wildtype dystrophin levels at high doses. Validation data showed that inter- and intra-assay precision were ≤20% (≤25% at the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) and inter- and intra-run relative error was within ±20% (±25% at LLOQ).

34736624,The DMD gene and therapeutic approaches to restore dystrophin.,,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness. It is caused by a variety of DMD gene pathogenic variations (large deletions or duplications, and small mutations) which leads to the absence or to a decreased amount of dystrophin protein. The allelic Becker muscular dystrophy is characterized by later onset and milder muscle involvement, and other rarer phenotypes might also be associated, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, cognitive impairment, and other neurological signs. Following the identification of the genetic cause and the disease pathophysiology, innovative personalized therapies emerged. These can be categorized into two main groups: (1) therapies aiming at the restoration of dystrophin at the sarcolemma; (2) therapeutics dealing with secondary consequences of dystrophin deficiency. In this review we provide an overview about DMD genotype-phenotype correlation, and on main approaches to restore dystrophin as stop codon read-through, exon skipping, vector-mediated gene therapy, and genome-editing strategies, some of these are based on approved orphan drugs. Finally, we present the clinical potential of novel strategies combining therapies to correct the genetic defect and other approaches, targeting secondary downstream pathological cascade due to dystrophin deficiency.",,,,2021-11-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Less is known about their association with long-term respiratory function. In this study we investigated the features of respiratory progression in four DMD genotypes relevant in ongoing exon-skipping therapeutic strategies.
This was a retrospective longitudinal study including DMD children followed by the UK NorthStar Network and international AFM Network centers (May 2003 to October 2020). We included boys amenable to skip exons 44, 45, 51, or 53, who were older than 5 years of age and ambulant at first recorded visit.

This study investigated whether the serum creatinine (SCRN) level can be used as a biomarker of disease progression in dystrophinopathy.
We enrolled 377 male patients with dystrophinopathy and 520 male non-dystrophinopathy controls in a cross-sectional study. From this cohort, 113 follow-up patients were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Patients' demographic information, motor function, muscle fatty infiltration, and muscle dystrophin levels were evaluated. We investigated correlations between these parameters and SCRN levels, and determined changes in SCRN levels with maturation and with motor function changes.

To compare long-term clinical outcomes of eteplirsen-treated patients from Studies 201/202/405 with those of external controls.
Median total follow-up time was approximately 6 years of eteplirsen treatment. Outcomes included loss of ambulation (LOA) and percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%p). Time to LOA was compared between eteplirsen-treated patients and standard of care (SOC) external controls and was measured from eteplirsen initiation in 201/202 or, in the SOC group, from the first study visit. Comparisons were conducted using univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models with regression adjustment for baseline characteristics. Annual change in FVC%p was compared between eteplirsen-treated patients and natural history study patients using linear mixed models with repeated measures.
Data were included from all 12 patients in Studies 201/202 and the 10 patients with available data from 405. Median age at LOA was 15.16 years.

34383334,Muscle architecture is associated with muscle fat replacement in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.,"MRI, dystrophin, fat fraction, muscle degeneration, pathophysiology",Muscle & nerve,"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD, respectively) are characterized by fat replacement of different skeletal muscles in a specific temporal order. Given the structural role of dystrophin in skeletal muscle mechanics, muscle architecture could be important in the progressive pathophysiology of muscle degeneration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the role of muscle architecture in the progression of fat replacement in DMD and BMD.
We assessed the association between literature-based leg muscle architectural characteristics and muscle fat fraction from 22 DMD and 24 BMD patients. Dixon-based magnetic resonance imaging estimates of fat fractions at baseline and 12 (only DMD) and 24 months were related to fiber length and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) using age-controlled linear mixed modeling.
DMD and BMD muscles with long fibers and BMD muscles with large PCSAs were associated with increased fat fraction. The effect of fiber length was stronger in muscles with larger PCSA.
Muscle architecture may explain the pathophysiology of muscle degeneration in dystrophinopathies, in which proximal muscles with a larger mass (fiber length × PCSA) are more susceptible, confirming the clinical observation of a temporal proximal-to-distal progression. These results give more insight into the mechanical role in the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies. Ultimately, this new information can be used to help support the selection of current and the development of future therapies.",,DMD and BMD muscles with long fibers and BMD muscles with large PCSAs were associated with increased fat fraction.

34383312,Evaluating longitudinal therapy effects via the North Star Ambulatory Assessment.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, efficacy, motor function, outcome measure, treatment",Muscle & nerve,"In comparative studies, treatment effects are typically evaluated at a specific time point. When data are collected periodically, an alternative, clinically meaningful approach could be used to assess the totality of treatment effects. We applied a well-developed analytical procedure for evaluating longitudinal treatment effects using North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) data for illustration.
The NSAA comprises 17 scorable items/outcomes that measure changes in motor function. Using NSAA data from the published ataluren phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT01826487), cumulative counts of failures to perform each item (transition from 2/1 [able/impaired] to 0 [unable]) were collected at specified time points for each patient over 48 wk. Treatment group-wise mean cumulative item failure count curves were constructed, comparing ataluren versus placebo and deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone among placebo-treated patients. The steeper the curve, the worse the outcome. A clinically meaningful summary of the between-group difference was provided for each comparison.
The curve was uniformly steeper for placebo than ataluren after 16 wk and for prednisone/prednisolone than deflazacort after 8 wk. The two curves in each comparison continued to diverge thereafter, indicating sustained treatment benefits over time. Using a unique analytical approach, cumulative failure rates were reduced, on average, by 27% for ataluren versus placebo (rate ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.97; p = .027) and 28% for deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone (rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.96; p = .028).

Thus, there is a need for disease specific COAs that track meaningful change among individuals. When developing such measures, input from clinicians, caregivers and patients is critical for assessing clinically relevant concepts and ensuring validity of the measure.
The aim of this study was to develop two Duchenne-specific global impression items for use in clinical trials. The development of the Duchenne Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and Caregiver Global Impression of Change (CaGI-C) was informed by findings from concept elicitation (CE) interviews with clinicians, caregivers and individuals with Duchenne. Through cognitive debriefing (CD) interviews, clinicians and caregivers evaluated draft CGI-C and CaGI-C items to ensure relevance and understanding of the items and instructions. Suggestions made during the CD interviews were incorporated into the finalized CGI-C and CaGI-C measures.
The symptoms most frequently reported by clinicians, caregivers and individuals with Duchenne were muscle weakness, fatigue, cardiac difficulties and pain. Regarding physical functioning, all three populations noted that small changes in functional ability were meaningful, particularly when independence was impacted. Caregivers and clinicians reported that changes in speed, endurance and quality of movement were important, as was improvement in the ability of individuals to keep up with their peers.

Tamoxifen is a pro-drug some of whose metabolites interact with the nuclear estrogen receptor, leading to anti-fibrotic and muscle-protective effects as has been demonstrated in a murine model of DMD. Here we report the results from a monocentric single arm prospective study in 13 ambulant boys aged 6-14 years with genetically confirmed DMD, aimed to assess the safety of tamoxifen and its impact on disease progression. Boys were treated for up to 3 years with 20 mg/day of oral tamoxifen, in addition to their ongoing corticosteroid treatment. For 8 of these patients, outcome was compared to an age- and performance-matched 12-month natural history dataset. The primary end point was the 6-minute walk test. Secondary end points were the NorthStar assessment, timed function tests, pulmonary function, the biomarker creatine phosphokinase and adverse effects. No adverse effects were noticed other than mild gynecomastia in 4 boys.

Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in LTBP4 gene associate with prolonged ambulation in DMD patients, whereas an in-frame insertion polymorphism in the mouse LTBP4 locus modulates disease severity in mice by altering proteolytic stability of the Ltbp4 protein and release of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Givinostat, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials for DMD treatment, significantly reduces fibrosis in muscle tissue and promotes the increase of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of muscles in mdx mice. In this study, we investigated the activity of Givinostat in mdx and in D2.B10 mice, two mouse models expressing different Ltbp4 variants and developing mild or more severe disease as a function of Ltbp4 polymorphism.
Givinostat and steroids were administrated for 15 weeks in both DMD murine models and their efficacy was evaluated by grip strength and run to exhaustion functional tests. Histological examinations of skeletal muscles were also performed to assess the percentage of fibrotic area and CSA increase.
Givinostat treatment increased maximal normalized strength to levels that were comparable to those of healthy mice in both DMD models. The effect of Givinostat in both grip strength and exhaustion tests was dose-dependent in both strains, and in D2.B10 mice, Givinostat outperformed steroids at its highest dose. The in vivo treatment with Givinostat was effective in improving muscle morphology in both mdx and D2.B10 mice by reducing fibrosis.

While physical function, such as walking or climbing stairs, will be critical to demonstrating the long-term efficacy of a therapeutic, MRI may be a more objective approach that could detect subtle changes in disease status and offer earlier signals of clinical efficacy. In this study, researchers used baseline data from a Phase II clinical study (NCT02310763) to evaluate the relationship between measures of physical function and quantitative MRI assessments. They found that many MRI measures were moderately correlated with physical function, and muscle volume measurements were correlated with measures of strength. This study supports the use of MRI as a biomarker in Duchenne muscular dystrophy clinical trials.",,,,2021-06-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
34151852,The Minimal Clinical Important Difference (MCID) in Annual Rate of Change of Timed Function Tests in Boys with DMD.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, MCID, time function tests",Journal of neuromuscular diseases,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare x-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting 1 in every 5000-10000 [1, 2]. This disease leads to a variable but progressive sequential pattern of muscle weakness that eventually causes loss of important functional milestones such as the ability to walk. With promising drugs in development to ameliorate the effects of muscle weakness, these treatments must be associated with a clinically meaningful functional change.
The objective of this analysis is to determine both distribution, minimal detectable change (MDC), and anchor-based, minimal clinically important difference, (MCID) of 12 month change values in standardized time function tests (TFT) used to monitor disease progression in DMD.
This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a multi-center prospective natural history study with the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG). This study calculated MDC and MCID values for 3 commonly used timed function tests typically used to monitor disease progression; supine to stand (STS), 10 meter walk/run (10MWT), and 4 stair climb (4SC). MDC used standard error of measurement (SEM) while MCID measurements used the Vignos scale as an anchor to determine clinical change in functional status.
All 3 TFT were significantly important clinical endpoints to detect MDC and MCID changes. MDC and MCID 12 month changes were significant in 10MWT (-0.138, -0.212), Supine to Stand (-0.026, -0.023) and 4 stair climb (-0.034, -0.035) with an effect size greater or close to 0.2.
The 3 TFT are clinically meaningful endpoints used to establish change in DMD. MCID values were higher than MDC values indicating that an anchor-based approach using Vignos as a clinically meaningful loss of lower extremity abilities is appropriate to assess change in boys with DMD.","This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a multi-center prospective natural history study with the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG).

Due to muscle weakness, performance of daily activities becomes increasingly difficult, which leads to reduced independence and quality of life. In order to support the performance of upper extremity tasks, dynamic arm supports may be used. The Yumen Arm is a novel dynamic arm support specially developed for people with NMD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the Yumen Arm in persons with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and persons with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).
Three persons with DMD and three persons with SMA participated in this study. All participants conducted a set of measures with and without the Yumen Arm. Outcome measures were: active range of motion of the arm and trunk (i.e. Reachable Workspace, Functional Workspace, and trunk movement), fatigue (OMNI-RPE), Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) scale and some additional activities of daily living. User experiences were collected using a questionnaire.
The Yumen Arm could be used by all participants. Results showed a median increase in active range of motion (4% relative surface area), and a median increase of function ability (> 11% PUL score) when using the Yumen Arm. In addition, three out of four (data from 2 participants was missing) participants indicated that activity performance was less fatiguing when using the Yumen Arm. Four out of five (data from 1 participant was missing) participants indicated that they would like to use the Yumen Arm in their daily lives.
This study is one of the first studies describing a range of objective measures to examine the effectiveness of a dynamic arm support. Based on these measurements we can conclude that the Yumen Arm effectively improves arm function in NMD patients, however the effectiveness varies a lot between individual subjects. We provided detailed recommendations for the improvement of the Yumen Arm, and possible also for the development of other dynamic arm supports. This study showed a lot of variability between individual subjects, which emphasizes the importance of tuning dynamic arm supports based on individual user characteristics, such as scoliosis, functional capacity and muscle strength.",,"The Yumen Arm could be used by all participants.

There are an estimated 450 companies across the globe working on the development of gene therapies and more than 1,000 clinical trials underway worldwide, and some 20-30 new ATMPs filings are expected in Europe annually over the next 5 years. But challenges confront the sector, complicating the translation from research into patient access. Scientific, clinical development and regulatory issues are compounded by limited experience with clinical and commercial use, limited manufacturing know-how, high costs, and difficulties in accessing development funding and investment. Pricing and reimbursement and market access issues are an additional challenge, particularly in Europe, where unfamiliarity with the technology and uncertainty over the use of real-world evidence induce caution among clinicians, health technology assessment bodies and payers. There is a need for a review of the suitability of the regulatory and market access framework for these products, focused development of data, public/private partnerships, and fuller collaboration governments, doctors, insurers, patients, and pharmaceutical companies.

Wrist extensor muscle strength and excitability were assessed in males with DMD (N = 10; mean ± standard deviation: 15.4 ± 5.9 years of age), using the Brooke Upper Extremity Rating Scale (scored 1-6), and age-matched healthy male controls (N = 15; 15.5 ± 5.0 years of age). Torque and electromyographic (EMG) measurements were analyzed under maximum voluntary and stimulated conditions at two visits.
A protocol of multiple maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and evoked twitch contractions was feasible and safe, with 96% of the participants completing the protocol and having a less than 7% strength decrement on either measure for both DMD patients and controls (P ≥ .074).

Robust expression of microdystrophin occurred in heart and limb muscles of treated mice. mdxRGT versus mdxGT mice showed increased microdystrophin in quadriceps but decreased levels in diaphragm. mdx final treadmill fatigue time was depressed compared to all groups, improved in mdxGT, and highest in mdxRGT. Both weekly running distance (km) and final treadmill fatigue time for mdxRGT and WTR were similar. Remarkably, mdxRGT diaphragm power was only rescued to 60% of WT, suggesting a negative impact of running. However, potential changes in fiber type distribution in mdxRGT diaphragms could indicate an adaptation to trade power for endurance.

33834485,Instruments to assess upper-limb function in children and adolescents with neuromuscular diseases: a systematic review.,,Developmental medicine and child neurology,"To synthesize clinical and scientific evidence regarding the instruments available to assess upper-limb function in paediatric patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD).
This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines (Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews no. CRD42020140343). Two independent reviewers searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS, Embase, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria were cross-sectional or longitudinal studies or randomized controlled trials that used scales or questionnaires to assess upper-limb function in paediatric patients with NMDs. The COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist and criteria for good measurement properties were applied to assess the methodological quality of the instruments.
In total, 34 articles and 12 instruments were included. The Brooke Upper Extremity (n=16) and Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) (n=12) instruments were the most used tools. The PUL and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) Upper Limb patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) tested more measurement properties and provided higher methodological quality scores for patients with DMD. Likewise, the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) was the most suitable instrument for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. No instrument has been devised to assess upper-limb function in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and no other disease-specific instruments were found.
The PUL, DMD Upper Limb PROM, and RULM are the most suitable instruments to assess upper-limb function in the two most prevalent paediatric NMDs. The identified gaps and methodological flaws of the available instruments indicate a need to develop high-quality instruments to assess other types of paediatric NMDs. What this paper adds The most suitable observer-rater instrument to assess upper-limb function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the Performance of Upper Limb. The most suitable observer-rater instrument to assess upper-limb function in spinal muscular atrophy is the Revised Upper Limb Module. The DMD Upper Limb patient-reported outcome measure is recommended to assess the upper-limb performance of patients with DMD. Literature gaps and methodological flaws indicate the need to develop high-quality instruments to assess other types of paediatric neuromuscular disease.

Clinical evaluations over time have demonstrated asymptomatic cardiac troponin elevations and acute elevations are associated with symptoms and cardiac dysfunction in DMD. Clinicians require a better understanding of the relationship of symptoms, troponin levels and progression of cardiac disease in DMD. As clinical trials begin to assess novel cardiac therapeutics in DMD, troponin levels in DMD are important for safety monitoring and outcome measures. The Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy convened an expert panel of cardiologists, scientists, and regulatory and industry specialists on 16 December 2019 in Silver Spring, Maryland and reviewed published and unpublished data from their institutions.

New therapies have been developed in recent years that change the natural history of the disease. The aim of this study is to describe patients included in the Polish Registry of SMA, with a focus on the course of type 3 SMA (SMA3) before the availability of disease-modifying treatments.
790 patients with SMA were included in the registry (173 with type 1 [SMA1], 218 with type 2 [SMA2], 393 with SMA3, and six with type 4 SMA [SMA4]), most (52%) of whom were adults. Data on SMN2 gene copy number were available for 672 (85%) patients. The mean age of onset was 5 months for SMA1, 11.5 months for SMA2, and 4.5 years for SMA3. In patients with SMA3, the first symptoms occurred earlier in those with three copies of SMN2 than in those with four copies of SMN2 (3.2 years vs. 6.7 years). The age of onset of SMA3 was younger in girls than in boys (3.1 years vs. 5.7 years), with no new cases observed in women older than 16 years. Male patients outnumbered female patients, especially among patients with SMA3b (49 female vs. 85 male patients) and among patients with SMA3 with four copies of SMN2 (30 female vs. 69 male patients). 44% of patients with SMA3 were still able to walk; in those who were not still able to walk, the mean age of immobilization was 14.0 years. Patients with SMA3a (age of onset < 3 years) and three copies of SMN2 had significantly worse prognosis for remaining ambulant than patients with SMA3b (age of onset ≥ 3 years) and four copies of SMN2.
The Registry of SMA is an effective tool for assessing the disease course in the real world setting. SMN2 copy number is an important prognostic factor for the age of onset and ambulation in SMA3.

Therapy development is delayed by difficulties to monitor efficacy non-invasively in clinical trials. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing to describe the pathophysiological changes in skeletal muscle of 3 dystrophic mouse models. We show how dystrophic changes in muscle are reflected in blood by analyzing paired muscle and blood samples. Analysis of repeated blood measurements followed the dystrophic signature at five equally spaced time points over a period of seven months. Treatment with two antisense drugs harboring different levels of dystrophin recovery identified genes associated with safety and efficacy. Evaluation of the blood gene expression in a cohort of DMD patients enabled the comparison between preclinical models and patients, and the identification of genes associated with physical performance, treatment with corticosteroids and body measures. The presented results provide evidence that blood RNA-sequencing can serve as a tool to evaluate disease progression in dystrophic mice and patients, as well as to monitor response to (dystrophin-restoring) therapies in preclinical drug development and in clinical trials.",,,,2021-03-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To anticipate on results of interventions targeting dystrophin expression it is important to know the natural variation of dystrophin expression between different muscles and over time. Dystrophin was quantified using capillary Western immunoassay (Wes) in the anterior tibial (TA) muscle of 37 BMD patients. Variability was studied using two samples from the same TA biopsy site in nine patients, assessing nine longitudinal TA biopsies, and eight simultaneously obtained vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies. Measurements were performed in duplicate with two primary antibodies. Baseline dystrophin levels were correlated to longitudinal muscle strength and functional outcomes. Results showed low technical variability and high precision for both antibodies. Dystrophin TA levels ranged from 4.8 to 97.7%, remained stable over a 3-5 year period, and did not correlate with changes in longitudinal muscle function. Dystrophin levels were comparable between TA and VL muscles. Intra-muscle biopsy variability was low (5.2% and 11.4% of the total variability of the two antibodies). These observations are relevant for the design of clinical trials targeting dystrophin production, and may urge the need for other biomarkers or surrogate endpoints.",,,,2021-03-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Jumping mechanography is a medical diagnostic method for motion analysis, which allows to quantify physical parameters. In this study, we compared mechanography with timed function tests (TFTs).
41 ambulatory DMD patients performed a total of 95 chair rising tests (CRT) and a total of 76 single two-legged jumps (S2LJ) on a mechanography ground reaction force platform. The results were correlated with a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the time required to run 10 meters, stand up from a supine position, and climb four stairs, all performed in the same setting.
Our measurements show a high correlation between mechanography and the TFTs: S2LJ/10-m run, 
Jumping mechanography is a reliable additional method, which can be used for physical endpoint measurements in clinical trials. We confirmed our assumption, that the method provides additional information concerning performance at movement with higher power output. We suggest using the S2LJ as a first-choice tandem tool combined with the 6MWT.

Following the identification of pathogenic variations in the dystrophin gene in 1986, the underlining genotype/phenotype correlations emerged and the role of the dystrophin protein was elucidated in skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles, as well as in the brain. When the dystrophin protein is absent or quantitatively or qualitatively modified, the muscle cannot sustain the stress of repeated contractions. Dystrophin acts as a bridging and anchoring protein between the sarcomere and the sarcolemma, and its absence or reduction leads to severe muscle damage that eventually cannot be repaired, with its ultimate substitution by connective tissue and fat. The advances of an understanding of the molecular pathways affected in DMD have led to the development of many therapeutic strategies that tackle different aspects of disease etiopathogenesis, which have recently led to the first successful approved orphan drugs for this condition. The therapeutic advances in this field have progressed exponentially, with second-generation drugs now entering in clinical trials as gene therapy, potentially providing a further effective approach to the condition.",,,,2021-03-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Although most patients with DMD die from heart failure, cardiomyopathy is undetectable until the teens, so efficacy from trials in young boys will be unknown for a decade. Available DMD animal models were sufficient to demonstrate micro-dystrophin efficacy on earlier onset skeletal muscle pathology underlying loss of ambulation and respiratory insufficiency in patients. However, no mouse models progressed into heart failure, and dog models showed highly variable progression insufficient to evaluate efficacy of micro-dystrophin or other therapies on DMD heart failure. To overcome this barrier, we have generated the first DMD mouse model to our knowledge that reproducibly progresses into heart failure. This model shows cardiac inflammation and fibrosis occur prior to reduced function. Fibrosis does not continue to accumulate, but inflammation persists after function declines. We used this model to test micro-dystrophin gene therapy efficacy on heart failure prevention for the first time. Micro-dystrophin prevented declines in cardiac function and prohibited onset of inflammation and fibrosis. This model will allow identification of committed pathogenic steps to heart failure and testing of genetic and nongenetic therapies to optimize cardiac care for patients with DMD.",,,,2021-03-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We have developed a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based single-step assay to sequence the entire 2.2 Mb of the DMD gene to detect all copy number and sequence variants in both index males and carrier females. Assay validation was 100% concordant with other methodologies. A total of 772 samples have been tested, of which 62% (N = 480) were index cases with a clinical suspicion of DMD. Carrier testing females account for 38% (N = 292). Molecular diagnosis was confirmed in 86% (N = 413) of the index cases. Intragenic deletions and duplications (single-exon or multi-exon) were detected in 60% (N = 247) and 14% (N = 58) of the index cases, respectively. Full-sequence analysis of the entire gene allows for detection of deep intronic pathogenic variants and accurate breakpoint detection of CNVs involving similar exons, which could have an impact on the outcome of clinical trials.

The disease is caused by mutations in DMD (encoding dystrophin) that abolish the production of dystrophin in muscle. Muscles without dystrophin are more sensitive to damage, resulting in progressive loss of muscle tissue and function, in addition to cardiomyopathy. Recent studies have greatly deepened our understanding of the primary and secondary pathogenetic mechanisms. Guidelines for the multidisciplinary care for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that address obtaining a genetic diagnosis and managing the various aspects of the disease have been established.

Patients had a median age of 51 years (28-78y) and median follow-up duration of 14 years (2-25y). We analysed 190 pulmonary function measurements with a median interval of one year (1-17y) and measured a 1.00% decline of Forced Vital Capacity percent predicted (FVC%pred) per year (p = 0.004). Loss of ambulation significantly increased the annual rate of FVC decline and was dependent of patient's body mass index (BMI; p = 0.015), with increases in BMI correlating with an even more rapid deterioration of FVC.

Many of these trials have reported a clear increase in dystrophin protein following treatment. However, the low levels of the induced dystrophin protein have raised questions on its functionality. In our present study, using an unbiased, high-throughput digital image analysis platform, we assessed markers of regeneration and levels of dystrophin associated protein via immunofluorescent analysis of whole muscle sections in 25 DMD boys who received 48-weeks treatment with exon 53 skipping morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) golodirsen. We demonstrate that the de novo dystrophin induced by exon skipping with PMO golodirsen is capable of conferring a histological benefit in treated patients with an increase in dystrophin associated proteins at the dystrophin positive regions of the sarcolemma in post-treatment biopsies. Although 48 weeks treatment with golodirsen did not result in a significant change in the levels of fetal/developmental myosins for the entire cohort, there was a significant negative correlation between the amount of dystrophin and levels of regeneration observed in different biopsy samples.

Most patients die from respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy. There are significant unmet needs for treatments for DMD as the standard of care is principally limited to symptom relief through treatments including steroids.
This review summarizes safety and efficacy in promising areas of DMD therapeutics - small molecules, stop codon readthrough, gene replacement, and exon skipping - under clinical examination from 2015-2020 as demonstrated in the NIH Clinical Trials and PubMed search engines.
Currently, steroids persist as the most accessible medicine for DMD. Stop-codon readthrough, gene replacement, and exon-skipping therapies all aim to restore dystrophin expression. Of these strategies, gene replacement therapy has recently gained momentum while exon-skipping retains great traction.

33387637,Safinamide in neurological disorders and beyond: Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies.,"Developmental history, Epilepsy, MAO-B, Parkinson’s disease, Safinamide",Brain research bulletin,"The discovery and development of safinamide, an alpha-aminoamide, has been a valuable addition to the existing clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). The journey of safinamide dates back to the year 1983, when an alpha-aminoamide called milacemide showed a weak anticonvulsant activity. Milacemide was then structurally modified to give rise to safinamide, which in turn produced robust anticonvulsant activity. The underlying mechanism behind this action of safinamide is attributed to the inhibition of voltage gated calcium and sodium channels. Moreover, owing to the importance of ion channels in maintaining neuronal circuitry and neurotransmitter release, numerous studies explored the potential of safinamide in neurological diseases including PD, stroke, multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonias. Nevertheless, evidence from multiple preclinical studies suggested a potent, selective and reversible inhibitory activity of safinamide against monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B enzyme which is responsible for degrading dopamine, a neurotransmitter primarily implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. Therefore, clinical studies were conducted to assess safety and efficacy of safinamide in PD. Indeed, results from various Phase 3 clinical trials suggested strong evidence of safinamide as an add-on therapy in controlling the exacerbation of PD. This review presents a thorough developmental history of safinamide in PD and provides comprehensive insight into plausible mechanisms via which safinamide can be explored in other neurological and muscular diseases.",,,,2021-01-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 132 Duchenne patients (112 alive/20 dead, age 3.5÷32.3 years) with the aims: 1) to provide a comprehensive description of the clinical status considering different aspects of the disease; 2) to propose a new scoring tool able to consider and pool together heterogeneous different functional. Five functions were analyzed: cardiac, respiratory, nutritional, ambulation and scoliosis. For each function, different items were considered and classified according to clinical severity (as indicated by international guidelines) and an incremental scoring was assigned. In addition, a global score incorporating all functions was defined. The scoring system confirmed that despite the significant protective role of steroids, all functions deteriorated with age. The severity of the global score became significantly higher since the age of 13 years. The severity of cardiac, respiratory and nutritional dysfunction was higher since 18 years. Deceased patients were characterized by significantly worse cardiac function, absence of steroid therapy and later use of respiratory assistive devices. The index proposed in this pilot study is a promising tool able to aggregate and correlate heterogeneous functions. It could become either an individual prognostic indicator of decline or a global score to evaluate changes in clinical trials therefore allowing multicenter studies, optimizing the management of both the primary and the secondary complications of the disease and understanding their relative impact.",,,,2020-12-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Inherited monogenic neuromuscular disorders encompass both muscular dystrophies and motor neuron diseases. Understanding of their causative genetic defects and pathological genetic mechanisms has led to the unprecedented clinical translation of genetic therapies. Challenged by a broad range of gene defect types, researchers have developed different approaches to tackle mutations by hijacking the cellular gene expression machinery to minimize the mutational damage and produce the functional target proteins. Such manipulations may be directed to any point of the gene expression axis, such as classical gene augmentation, modulating premature termination codon ribosomal bypass, splicing modification of pre-mRNA, etc. With the soar of the CRISPR-based gene editing systems, researchers now gravitate toward genome surgery in tackling NMDs by directly correcting the mutational defects at the genome level and expanding the scope of targetable NMDs. In this article, we will review the current development of gene therapy and focus on NMDs that are available in published reports, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2C (LGMD2C).",,,,2020-12-20,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Various types of stem/progenitor cells and their derivatives have shown positive therapeutic results in animal models of neurological disorders and in clinical trials. Each tested cell type proved to have its advantages and flaws and unique cellular and molecular mechanism of action, prompting the idea to test combined transplantation of two or more types of cells (combined cell therapy). This review summarizes the results of combined cell therapy of neurological pathologies reported up to this point. The number of papers describing experimental studies or clinical trials addressing this subject is still limited. However, its successful application to the treatment of neurological pathologies including stroke, spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative diseases, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and retinal degeneration has been reported in both experimental and clinical studies. The advantages of combined cell therapy can be realized by simple summation of beneficial effects of different cells. Alternatively, one kind of cells can support the survival and functioning of the other by enhancing the formation of optimum environment or immunomodulation.

Patients experience muscle weakness and loss of ambulation at an early age, with ∼75% reduced life expectancy. Recently developed genetic editing strategies aim to convert severe DMD phenotypes to a milder disease course. Among these, the antisense oligonucleotide (AO)-mediated exon skipping and the adeno-associated viral-delivered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (adeno-associated viral (AAV)-delivered CRISPR/Cas9) gene editing have shown promising results in restoring dystrophin protein expression and functionality in skeletal and heart muscle in both animals and human cells in vivo and in vitro.

The treatment of neuromuscular diseases has changed in recent years, from palliative symptom management to preventive methods for capacity building. The use of virtual reality is beginning to be necessary in the treatment of progressive diseases involving movement difficulties, as it provides freedom and facilitates the improvement of results in capacity training. Given that new technologies are increasingly accessible, rehabilitation and physiotherapy programs can use these technologies more frequently, and virtual reality environments can be used to improve task performance, which is essential for people with disabilities.

These diseases lead to life-long motor deficiencies and specific organ failures, and are, in their worst-case scenarios, life threatening. Amongst other causes, they can be genetically inherited through mutations in more than 500 different genes. In the last 20 years, specific pharmacological treatments have been approved for human usage. However, these ""à-la-carte"" therapies cover only a very small portion of the clinical needs and are often partially efficient in alleviating the symptoms of the disease, even less so in curing it. Recombinant adeno-associated virus vector-mediated gene transfer is a more general strategy that could be adapted for a large majority of these diseases and has proved very efficient in rescuing the symptoms in many neuropathological animal models.

Since each neuromuscular disease presents a specific pattern of muscle involvement, the recommended analysis is assumed to be the muscle-by-muscle approach. We, therefore, performed a comparative analysis of different segmentation approaches, including global muscle segmentation, to determine the best strategy for evaluating disease progression.
In 102 patients (21 immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy/IMNM, 21 inclusion body myositis/IBM, 10 GNE myopathy/GNEM, 19 Duchenne muscular dystrophy/DMD, 12 dysferlinopathy/DYSF, 7 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy/LGMD2I, 7 Pompe disease, 5 spinal muscular atrophy/SMA), two MRI scans were obtained at a 1-year interval in thighs and lower legs. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in individual muscles, muscle groups, and the global muscle segment. Standardized response means (SRMs) were determined to assess sensitivity to change in fat fraction (ΔFat%) in individual muscles, muscle groups, weighted combinations of muscles and muscle groups, and in the global muscle segment.
Global muscle segmentation gave high SRMs for ΔFat% in thigh and lower leg for IMNM, DYSF, LGMD2I, DMD, SMA, and Pompe disease, and only in lower leg for GNEM and thigh for IBM.
Global muscle segment Fat% showed to be sensitive to change in most investigated neuromuscular disorders. As compared to individual muscle drawing, it is a faster and an easier approach to assess disease progression. The use of individual muscle ROIs, however, is still of interest for exploring selective muscle involvement.
• MRI-based evaluation of fatty replacement in muscles is used as an outcome measure in the assessment of 1-year disease progression in 8 different neuromuscular diseases. • Different segmentation approaches, including global muscle segmentation, were evaluated for determining 1-year fat fraction changes in lower limb skeletal muscles. • Global muscle segment fat fraction has shown to be sensitive to change in lower leg and thigh in most of the investigated neuromuscular diseases.",,"Global muscle segmentation gave high SRMs for ΔFat% in thigh and lower leg for IMNM, DYSF, LGMD2I, DMD, SMA, and Pompe disease, and only in lower leg for GNEM and thigh for IBM.",,2020-11-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
33215271,[Expert recommendation: treatment of nonambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy].,"Ataluren, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Exon skipping, Glucocorticoids, Idebenone, Pharmacological therapy",Der Nervenarzt,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent genetic neuromuscular disease in childhood with loss of ambulation usually occurring around the age of 9-11 years.
Based on current guidelines and clinical trials, neuropediatric and neurological experts developed recommendations for the treatment of nonambulatory DMD patients focusing on drug treatment of adults. This advisory board was sponsored by PTC Therapeutics, the distributers of the substance ataluren.
Loss of ambulation is heterogeneously defined across clinical trials. Among others, the need of a wheelchair, ambulation without mobility aids or maximum walking distance can be suitable parameters for assessment. Treatment of DMD patients at any stage of the disease is based on supportive and symptomatic measures, which should be continued after loss of ambulation. In addition, disease-modifying drugs are available for the treatment of DMD and glucocorticoids are the usual standard of care treatment even beyond the loss of ambulation. Ataluren, a potentially dystrophin restorative, disease-modifying treatment, has been approved for patients with DMD due to a nonsense mutation (nmDMD), which applies to approximately 13% of DMD patients and is usually combined with steroids. Clinical data from the STRIDE registry demonstrated a delayed disease progression even after loss of ambulation. Currently, no reliable data are available for exon skipping approaches in adult DMD patients. The antioxidant idebenone could be an option in nonambulant adolescent patients not treated with glucocorticoids and without other therapeutic options. A combination treatment of idebenone and glucocorticoids is currently being investigated in a clinical trial.

Some of the discussed treatment options are still in clinical trials or there are not enough data for older DMD patients; therefore, these expert recommendations correspond to evidence class IV.
HINTERGRUND: Die Muskeldystrophie Duchenne (DMD) ist die häufigste genetische neuromuskuläre Krankheit im Kindesalter, bei der es meist im Alter von 9 bis 11 Jahren zum Verlust der Gehfähigkeit kommt.
Auf der Grundlage aktueller Leitlinien und Studien erarbeiteten neuropädiatrische und neurologische Experten im Rahmen eines von der Firma PTC Therapeutics GmbH (Frankfurt am Main, Deutschland), die die Substanz Ataluren vertreibt, gesponserten Advisory Boards Empfehlungen zur Behandlung nichtgehfähiger Patienten mit DMD mit Schwerpunkt medikamentöse Therapien von Erwachsenen.
Der Verlust der Gehfähigkeit wird in Studien sehr unterschiedlich definiert und bezieht sich u. a. auf die Rollstuhlpflicht, das selbständige Gehen ohne Hilfsmittel oder die maximale Gehstrecke. Grundlage der Therapie von Patienten mit DMD in jedem Krankheitsstadium sind supportive und symptomatische Maßnahmen, die in der Regel auch nach dem Verlust der Gehfähigkeit intensiv weitergeführt werden sollten. Zusätzlich stehen den Patienten medikamentöse Therapien mit dem Ziel der Modifikation des Krankheitsverlaufes zur Verfügung. Glukokortikoide bilden den Stützpfeiler der medikamentösen Therapie auch über den Verlust der Gehfähigkeit hinaus, dann meist in reduzierter Dosis. Für Patienten mit DMD aufgrund einer Nonsense-Mutation (nmDMD), ca. 13 % aller DMD-Patienten, steht Ataluren als potenziell dystrophinwiederherstellende, krankheitsmodifizierende Therapie zur Verfügung; klinische Daten aus dem STRIDE-Register zeigen eine verzögerte Krankheitsprogression auch nach Verlust der Gehfähigkeit. Zum Exon-Skipping liegen für erwachsene Patienten derzeit noch keine belastbaren Daten vor. Das Antioxidans Idebenon kommt bei nichtgehfähigen, jugendlichen Patienten ohne therapeutische Alternative, die nicht mit Glukokortikoiden behandelt werden können, infrage. Ataluren eignet sich zur kombinierten Behandlung mit Glukokortikoiden, eine Kombination von Idebenon und Glukokortikoiden wird derzeit in einer klinischen Studie überprüft. Eine Add-on-Therapie mit Idebenon zusätzlich zu Ataluren ist bei nichtgehfähigen nmDMD-Patienten zu erwägen. Bedingt durch die Tatsache, dass sich einige der diskutierten Therapieoptionen noch in der Phase der klinischen Prüfung befinden oder noch keine oder nur begrenzte Daten für ältere Patienten mit DMD vorliegen, handelt es sich um Expertenempfehlungen entsprechend der Evidenzklasse IV.",,,,2020-11-21,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Genetic and clinical data from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network for 358 males born and diagnosed from 1982 to 2011 were analyzed. LoA was defined as the age at which independent ambulation ceased. Genetic mutations were defined by overall type (deletion/duplication/point mutation) and among deletions, those amenable to exon-skipping therapy (exons 8, 20, 44-46, 51-53) and another group. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

People with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) start using a powered wheelchair in their early teens due to the loss of strength in their legs and arms. There is evidence that low-intensity exercise can help preserve the functional abilities of people with DMD, but options for exercise when sitting in a powered wheelchair are limited.
In this paper, we present the design and the feasibility study of a new version of the MOVit device that allows powered-wheelchair users to exercise while driving the chair. Instead of using a joystick to drive the wheelchair, users move their arms through a cyclical motion using two powered, mobile arm supports that provide controller inputs to the chair. The feasibility study was carried out with a group of five individuals with DMD and five unimpaired individuals. Participants performed a series of driving tasks in a wheelchair simulator and on a real driving course with a standard joystick and with the MOVit 2.0 device.
We found that driving speed and accuracy were significantly lowered for both groups when driving with MOVit compared to the joystick, but the decreases were small (speed was 0.26 m/s less and maximum path error was 0.1 m greater). Driving with MOVit produced a significant increase in heart rate (7.5 bpm) compared to the joystick condition. Individuals with DMD reported a high level of satisfaction with their performance and comfort in using MOVit.
These results show for the first time that individuals with DMD can easily transition to driving a powered wheelchair using cyclical arm motions, achieving a reasonable driving performance with a short period of training. Driving in this way elicits cardiopulmonary exercise at an intensity found previously to produce health-related benefits in DMD.",,"We found that driving speed and accuracy were significantly lowered for both groups when driving with MOVit compared to the joystick, but the decreases were small (speed was 0.26 m/s less and maximum path error was 0.1 m greater).

Delayed puberty and bone fragility are consequences of GC treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the acceptability of a 2-year pubertal induction regimen using 4-weekly testosterone injections and examine changes in physique, bone integrity, muscle pathology (assessed by MRI) and muscle function.
Fifteen prepubertal males with DMD, aged 12-17 years and receiving GC, were treated with an incremental testosterone regimen for 2 years. Participants completed a Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQM). Data on BMI, bone density, muscle pathology and function were collected at baseline and 2 years later.
Testosterone injections were well tolerated, with high TSQM scores. Baseline BMI z-score was 2.16 (0.90) and 1.64 (1.35) 2 years later. Median testosterone levels were 9.7 nmol/L (IQR: 5.7-11.1) 6-9 months after the last injection with an associated increase in testicular volume.

We have previously shown that adult GRMD dogs have elevated expiratory flow as measured non-invasively during tidal breathing. This abnormality likely results from increased chest and diaphragmatic recoil associated with fibrosis and remodeling. Treatments must reverse pathologic effects on the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles to maximally reduce disease morbidity and mortality. Here, we extended our work in adults to younger GRMD dogs to define parameters that would be helpful in preclinical trials. Tidal breathing spirometry and respiratory inductance plethysmography were performed in GRMD dogs at approximately 3 and 6 months of age, corresponding to approximately 5-10 years in DMD, when clinical trials are often conducted. Expiratory flows were markedly elevated in GRMD versus normal dogs at 6 months. Values increased in GRMD dogs between 3 and 6 months, providing a 3-month window to assess treatment efficacy. These changes in breathing mechanics have not been previously identified at such an early age.

There are currently few effective therapies to treat the disease, although many small-molecule approaches are being pursued. Certain histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown to ameliorate DMD phenotypes in mouse and zebrafish animal models. The HDACi givinostat has shown promise for DMD in clinical trials. However, beyond a small group of HDACi, other classes of epigenetic small molecules have not been broadly and systematically studied for their benefits for DMD.
We used an established animal model for DMD, the zebrafish dmd mutant strain sapje. A commercially available library of epigenetic small molecules was used to treat embryonic-larval stages of dmd mutant zebrafish. We used a quantitative muscle birefringence assay in order to assess and compare the effects of small-molecule treatments on dmd mutant zebrafish skeletal muscle structure.
We performed a novel chemical-combination screen of a library of epigenetic compounds using the zebrafish dmd model. We identified candidate pools of epigenetic compounds that improve skeletal muscle structure in dmd mutant zebrafish. We then identified a specific combination of two HDACi compounds, oxamflatin and salermide, that ameliorated dmd mutant zebrafish skeletal muscle degeneration. We validated the effects of oxamflatin and salermide on dmd mutant zebrafish in an independent laboratory. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of oxamflatin and salermide caused increased levels of histone H4 acetylation in zebrafish larvae.

Drug repurposing, i.e. using drugs already approved for other disorders, is attractive as it decreases development time. Recent studies suggested that simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug used for cardiovascular diseases, has beneficial effects on several parameters in mdx mice. To validate properly the effectiveness of simvastatin, two independent labs tested the effects of 12-week simvastatin treatment in either young (starting at 4 weeks of age) or adult (starting at 12 weeks of age) mdx mice. In neither study were benefits of simvastatin treatment observed on muscle function, histology or expression of genes involved in fibrosis, regeneration, oxidative stress and autophagy. Unexpectedly, although the treatment protocol was similar, simvastatin plasma levels were found to be much lower than observed in a previous study. In conclusion, in two laboratories, simvastatin did not ameliorate disease pathology in mdx mice, which could either be due to the ineffectiveness of simvastatin itself or due to the low simvastatin plasma levels following oral administration via the food.",,,,2020-10-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

It provides an upper extremity functional score suitable for both weaker ambulatory and non-ambulatory phases up to the severely impaired patients. It is capable of characterizing overall progression and severity of disease and of tracking the stereotypical proximal-to-distal progressive loss of upper limb function in muscular dystrophy. Since the PUL module has been validated only with Duchenne patients, its use also for Becker and Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy patients has been here evaluated, to verify its reliability and extend its use. In particular, two different assessors performed this scale on 32 dystrophic subjects in two consecutive days. The results showed that the PUL module has high reliability, both absolute and relative, based on the calculation of Pearson's r (0.9942), Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (0.9943), Standard Error of Measurement (1.36), Minimum Detectable Change (3.77), and Coefficient of Variation (3%). The Minimum Detectable Change, in particular, can be used in clinical trials to perform a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of the effects of interventions with the lapse of time. According to this analysis, an intervention is effective if the difference in the PUL score between subsequent evaluation points is equal or higher than 4 points; otherwise, the observed effect is not relevant. Inter-rater reliability with ten different assessors was evaluated, and it has been demonstrated that deviation from the mean is lower than calculated Minimum Detectable Change. The present work provides evidence that the PUL module is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring upper limb ability in people with different forms of muscular dystrophy.

32956407,Efficacy and safety of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: An 18-month interim analysis of a non-randomized open-label extension study.,,PLoS medicine,"Treatment with corticosteroids is recommended for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients to slow the progression of weakness. However, chronic corticosteroid treatment causes significant morbidities. Vamorolone is a first-in-class anti-inflammatory investigational drug that has shown evidence of efficacy in DMD after 24 weeks of treatment at 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day. Here, open-label efficacy and safety experience of vamorolone was evaluated over a period of 18 months in trial participants with DMD.
A multicenter, open-label, 24-week trial (VBP15-003) with a 24-month long-term extension (VBP15-LTE) was conducted by the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) and evaluated drug-related effects of vamorolone on motor outcomes and corticosteroid-associated safety concerns. The study was carried out in Canada, US, UK, Australia, Sweden, and Israel, from 2016 to 2019. This report covers the initial 24-week trial and the first 12 months of the VBP15-LTE trial (total treatment period 18 months). DMD trial participants (males, 4 to <7 years at entry) treated with 2.0 or 6.0 mg/kg/day vamorolone for the full 18-month period (n = 23) showed clinical improvement of all motor outcomes from baseline to month 18 (time to stand velocity, p = 0.012 [95% CI 0.010, 0.068 event/second]; run/walk 10 meters velocity, p < 0.001 [95% CI 0.220, 0.491 meters/second]; climb 4 stairs velocity, p = 0.001 [95% CI 0.034, 0.105 event/second]; 6-minute walk test, p = 0.001 [95% CI 31.14, 93.38 meters]; North Star Ambulatory Assessment, p < 0.001 [95% CI 2.702, 6.662 points]). Outcomes in vamorolone-treated DMD patients (n = 46) were compared to group-matched participants in the CINRG Duchenne Natural History Study (corticosteroid-naïve, n = 19; corticosteroid-treated, n = 68) over a similar 18-month period. Time to stand was not significantly different between vamorolone-treated and corticosteroid-naïve participants (p = 0.088; least squares [LS] mean 0.042 [95% CI -0.007, 0.091]), but vamorolone-treated participants showed significant improvement compared to group-matched corticosteroid-naïve participants for run/walk 10 meters velocity (p = 0.003; LS mean 0.286 [95% CI 0.104, 0.469]) and climb 4 stairs velocity (p = 0.027; LS mean 0.059 [95% CI 0.007, 0.111]). The vamorolone-related improvements were similar in magnitude to corticosteroid-related improvements. Corticosteroid-treated participants showed stunting of growth, whereas vamorolone-treated trial participants did not (p < 0.001; LS mean 15.86 [95% CI 8.51, 23.22]). Physician-reported incidences of adverse events (AEs) for Cushingoid appearance, hirsutism, weight gain, and behavior change were less for vamorolone than published incidences for prednisone and deflazacort. Key limitations to the study were the open-label design, and use of external comparators.
We observed that vamorolone treatment was associated with improvements in some motor outcomes as compared with corticosteroid-naïve individuals over an 18-month treatment period. We found that fewer physician-reported AEs occurred with vamorolone than have been reported for treatment with prednisone and deflazacort, and that vamorolone treatment did not cause the stunting of growth seen with these corticosteroids. This Phase IIa study provides Class III evidence to support benefit of motor function in young boys with DMD treated with vamorolone 2.0 to 6.0 mg/kg/day, with a favorable safety profile. A Phase III RCT is underway to further investigate safety and efficacy.

The morpholino AON viltolarsen (code name: NS-065/NCNP-01) has been shown to induce exon 53 skipping, restoring the reading frame for patients with exon 52 deletions. We recently administered NS-065/NCNP-01 intravenously to DMD patients in an exploratory investigator-initiated, first-in-human trial of NS-065/NCNP-01. In this methods article, we present the molecular characterization of dystrophin expression using Sanger sequencing, RT-PCR, and western blotting in the clinical trial. The characterization of dystrophin expression was fundamental in the study for showing the efficacy since no functional outcome tests were performed.",,,,2020-09-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Affected patients lose ambulation by age 12 and usually die in the second to third decades of life from cardiac and respiratory failure. Symptomatic treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, which are associated with side effects including weight gain, osteoporosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Novel treatment options include blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, because angiotensin as well as aldosterone contribute to persistent inflammation and fibrosis, and aldosterone blockade represents an efficacious anti-fibrotic approach in cardiac failure. Recent preclinical findings enabled successful clinical testing of a combination of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in DMD boys. The efficacy of MRAs alone on dystrophic skeletal muscle and heart has not been investigated. Here, we tested efficacy of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone as a monotherapy in a preclinical DMD model.
The dystrophin-deficient, utrophin haploinsufficient mouse model of DMD was treated with finerenone and compared with untreated dystrophic and wild-type controls. Grip strength, electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, muscle force measurements, histological quantification, and gene expression studies were performed. Finerenone treatment alone resulted in significant improvements in clinically relevant functional parameters in both skeletal muscle and heart. Normalized grip strength in rested dystrophic mice treated with finerenone (40.3 ± 1.0 mN/g) was significantly higher (P = 0.0182) compared with untreated dystrophic mice (35.2 ± 1.5 mN/g). Fatigued finerenone-treated dystrophic mice showed an even greater relative improvement (P = 0.0003) in normalized grip strength (37.5 ± 1.1 mN/g) compared with untreated mice (29.7 ± 1.1 mN/g). Finerenone treatment also led to significantly lower (P = 0.0075) susceptibility to limb muscle damage characteristic of DMD measured during a contraction-induced injury protocol. Normalized limb muscle force after five lengthening contractions resulted in retention of 71 ± 7% of baseline force in finerenone-treated compared with only 51 ± 4% in untreated dystrophic mice. Finerenone treatment also prevented significant reductions in myocardial strain rate (P = 0.0409), the earliest sign of DMD cardiomyopathy. Moreover, treatment with finerenone led to very specific cardiac gene expression changes in clock genes that might modify cardiac pathophysiology in this DMD model.
Finerenone administered as a monotherapy is disease modifying for both skeletal muscle and heart in a preclinical DMD model. These findings support further evaluation of finerenone in DMD clinical trials.",,,,2020-09-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting motor neurons that is typically caused by homozygous whole-gene deletions of SMN1. DMD is an X-linked recessive muscle disease most often due to exon deletions, but also duplications and smaller sized variants within the DMD gene. Gene replacement therapy offers the opportunity to correct the underlying genetic defect by the introduction of a functional gene. We review the transformative work from clinical trials to United States Food and Drug Administration approval of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi in SMA and its application in clinical practice and the early results of microdystrophin delivery in DMD. We also review the introduction of antisense oligonucleotides to alter pre-messenger RNA splicing to promote exon inclusion (as in nusinersen in SMA) or exclusion (as in eteplirsen in DMD) into neuromuscular therapeutics.

The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of intracoronary administration of allogeneic CDCs in the multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, intracoronary ALLogeneic heart STem cells to Achieve myocardial Regeneration (ALLSTAR) trial.
We enrolled patients 4 weeks to 12 months after MI, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤45% and LV scar size ≥15% of LV mass by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A pre-specified interim analysis was performed when 6-month MRI data were available. The trial was subsequently stopped due to the low probability of detecting a significant treatment effect of CDCs based on the primary endpoint. Patients were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive CDCs or placebo in the infarct-related artery by stop-flow technique. The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence, during 1-month post-intracoronary infusion, of acute myocarditis attributable to allogeneic CDCs, ventricular tachycardia- or ventricular fibrillation-related death, sudden unexpected death, or a major adverse cardiac event (death or hospitalization for heart failure or non-fatal MI or need for left ventricular assist device or heart transplant). The primary efficacy endpoint was the relative percentage change in infarct size at 12 months post-infusion as assessed by contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI. We randomly allocated 142 eligible patients of whom 134 were treated (90 to the CDC group and 44 to the placebo group). The mean baseline LVEF was 40% and the mean scar size was 22% of LV mass. No primary safety endpoint events occurred. There was no difference in the percentage change from baseline in scar size (P = 0.51) between CDCs and placebo groups at 6 months. Compared with placebo, there were significant reductions in LV end-diastolic volume (P = 0.02), LV end-systolic volume (P = 0.02), and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (P = 0.02) at 6 months in CDC-treated patients.

Several studies have proposed circulating and tissue biomarkers, but none of them has been validated to monitor acute and long-term drug response. We previously described how the myostatin (MSTN) level is naturally downregulated in several neuromuscular diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here, we show that the dystrophin-deficient Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog model also presents an intrinsic loss of Mstn production in muscle. The abnormally low levels of Mstn observed in the GRMD dog puppies at 2 months were partially rescued at both mRNA and protein level after adeno-associated virus (AAV)-microdystrophin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that circulating Mstn is a robust and reliable quantitative biomarker, capable of measuring a therapeutic response to pharmaco-gene therapy in real time in the neuromuscular system, as well as a quantitative means for non-invasive follow-up of a therapeutic effect.

They are broadly divided into akinetic and hyperkinetic syndromes. Until now, no effective symptomatic or disease-modifying therapies have been available. However, since many of these disorders are monogenic or have some well-defined genetic component, they represent strong candidates for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies. ASO therapies are based on the use of short synthetic single-stranded ASOs that bind to disease-related target RNAs via Watson-Crick base-pairing and pleiotropically modulate their function. With information arising from the RNA sequence alone, it is possible to design ASOs that not only alter the expression levels but also the splicing defects of any protein, far exceeding the intervention repertoire of traditional small molecule approaches. Following the regulatory approval of ASO therapies for spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2016, there has been tremendous momentum in testing such therapies for other neurological disorders. This review article initially focuses on the chemical modifications aimed at improving ASO effectiveness, the mechanisms by which ASOs can interfere with RNA function, delivery systems and pharmacokinetics, and the common set of toxicities associated with their application. It, then, describes the pathophysiology and the latest information on preclinical and clinical trials utilizing ASOs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and ataxias 1, 2, 3, and 7.

Six placebo arms reporting 48-week Δ6MWD were identified via literature review and represented 4 sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria (n = 383 patients in total). Five sources of RWD/NHD were contributed by Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, DMD Italian Group, The Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group, ImagingDMD, and the PRO-DMD-01 study (n = 430 patients, in total). Mean Δ6MWD was compared between each placebo arm and RWD/NHD source after subjecting the latter to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the trial for baseline age, ambulatory function, and steroid use. Baseline covariate adjustment was investigated in a subset of patients with available data.
Analyses included ∼1,200 patient-years of follow-up.

However, glucocorticoids induce burdensome secondary effects, including hypertension, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, weight gain, growth delay, skin thinning, cushingoid appearance, and tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance. Hence, lowering the glucocorticoid dosage could be beneficial for DMD patients. A more profound insight into the major cellular pathways that are stabilized after synthetic glucocorticoid administration in DMD is needed when searching for the molecules able to achieve similar pathway stabilization. This review provides a concise overview of the major anti-inflammatory pathways, as well as the metabolic effects of glucocorticoids in the skeletal muscle affected in DMD.

Many of the advances have occurred in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a muscle wasting disease where affected boys are typically wheelchair bound by age 12 years and generally die in their twenties from respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy. Dystrophin is a 421 kD protein which links F-actin to the extracellular matrix via the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) at the muscle membrane. In the absence of dystrophin, the DAPC is lost, making the muscle membrane more susceptible to contraction-induced injury. The identification of the gene causing DMD in 1986 resulted in improved diagnosis of the disease and the identification of hotspots for mutation. There is currently no effective treatment. However, there are several promising genetic therapeutic approaches at the preclinical stage or in clinical trials including read-through of stop codons, exon skipping, delivery of dystrophin minigenes and the modulation of expression of the dystrophin related protein, utrophin. In spite of significant progress, the problem of targeting all muscles, including diaphragm and heart at sufficiently high levels, remains a challenge. Any therapy also needs to consider the immune response and some treatments are mutation specific and therefore limited to a subgroup of patients.

Serum samples from 39 steroid-naïve DMD boys 4 to <7 years enrolled into a clinical trial of vamorolone were studied (NCT02760264). Four assessments of gross motor function were carried out for each participant over a 6-week interval, and their mean was used as response for biomarker models. Weighted correlation network analysis was used for unsupervised clustering of 1305 proteins quantified using SOMAscan® aptamer profiling to define highly representative and connected proteins. Multivariate models of biomarkers were obtained for time to stand performance (strength phenotype; 17 proteins) and 6 min walk performance (endurance phenotype; 17 proteins) including some shared proteins. Identified proteins were tested with associations of mRNA expression with histological severity of muscle from dystrophinopathy patients (n = 28) and normal controls (n = 6). Strong associations predictive of both clinical and histological severity were found for ERBB4 (reductions in both blood and muscle with increasing severity), SOD1 (reductions in muscle and increases in blood with increasing severity) and CNTF (decreased levels in blood and muscle with increasing severity).

Data from patients with DMD in the placebo arm of a phase 3 trial (Tadalafil DMD trial) and two real-world sources (Universitaire Ziekenhuizen, Leuven, Belgium [Leuven] and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center [CCHMC]) were analyzed. One-year changes in 4SC completion time and velocity (stairs/second) were analyzed. Prognostic models included age, height, weight, steroid use, and multiple timed function tests and were developed using multivariable regression, separately in each data source. Simulations were used to quantify impacts on trial sample size requirements. Data on 1-year changes in 4SC were available from the Tadalafil DMD trial (n = 92) Leuven (n = 67), and CCHMC (n = 212). Models incorporating multiple timed function tests, height, and weight significantly improved prognostic accuracy for 1-year change in 4SC (R2: 29%-36% for 4SC velocity, and 29%-34% for 4SC time) compared to models including only age, baseline 4SC and steroid duration (R2:8%-17% for 4SC velocity and 2%-13% for 4SC time). Measures of walking and rising ability contributed important prognostic information for changes in 4SC. In a randomized trial with equal allocation to treatment and placebo, adjustment for such a prognostic score would enable detection (at 80% power) of a treatment effect of 0.25 stairs/second with 100-120 patients, compared to 170-190 patients without prognostic score adjustment. Combining measures of ambulatory function doubled prognostic accuracy for 1-year changes in 4SC completion time and velocity.

Safety was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included micro-dystrophin expression by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Functional outcomes measured by North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and serum creatine kinase were exploratory outcomes.
Four patients were included (mean [SD] age at enrollment, 4.8 [1.0] years). All adverse events (n = 53) were considered mild (33 [62%]) or moderate (20 [38%]), and no serious adverse events occurred. Eighteen adverse events were considered treatment related, the most common of which was vomiting (9 of 18 events [50%]). Three patients had transiently elevated γ-glutamyltransferase, which resolved with corticosteroids. At 12 weeks, immunohistochemistry of gastrocnemius muscle biopsy specimens revealed robust transgene expression in all patients, with a mean of 81.2% of muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin with a mean intensity of 96% at the sarcolemma. Western blot showed a mean expression of 74.3% without fat or fibrosis adjustment and 95.8% with adjustment. All patients had confirmed vector transduction and showed functional improvement of NSAA scores and reduced creatine kinase levels (posttreatment vs baseline) that were maintained for 1 year.
This trial showed rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin to be well tolerated and have minimal adverse events; the safe delivery of micro-dystrophin transgene; the robust expression and correct localization of micro-dystrophin protein; and improvements in creatine kinase levels and NSAA scores. These findings suggest that rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin can provide functional improvement that is greater than that observed under standard of care.

Historically, NHE-1 inhibitors were developed for cardiac therapeutic interventions. There is considerable overlap in the pathophysiological mechanisms in Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and in cardiomyopathy in DMD, therefore NHE-1 inhibition could be a promising pharmacological approach to the cardiac dysfunctions observed in DMD. Extensive preclinical data was collected in various animal models including dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mice to characterise Rimeporide's anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties and there is evidence that NHE-1 inhibitors could play a significant role in modifying DMD cardiac and also skeletal pathologies, as the NHE-1 isoform is ubiquitous. We report here the first study with Rimeporide in DMD patients. This 4-week treatment, open label phase Ib, multiple oral ascending dose study, enrolled 20 ambulant boys with DMD (6-11 years), with outcomes including safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers. Rimeporide was safe and well-tolerated at all doses. PK evaluations showed that Rimeporide was well absorbed orally reaching pharmacological concentrations from the lowest dose, with exposure increasing linearly with dose and with no evidence of accumulation upon repeated dosing. Exploratory PD biomarkers showed positive effect upon a 4-week treatment, supporting its therapeutic potential in patients with DMD, primarily as a cardioprotective treatment, and provide rationale for further efficacy studies.",,,,2020-06-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To date, there are limited agents available that address the underlying cause of the disease.
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of viltolarsen, a novel antisense oligonucleotide, in participants with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping.
This phase 2 study was a 4-week randomized clinical trial for safety followed by a 20-week open-label treatment period of patients aged 4 to 9 years with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. To enroll 16 participants, with 8 participants in each of the 2 dose cohorts, 17 participants were screened. Study enrollment occurred between December 16, 2016, and August 17, 2017, at sites in the US and Canada. Data were collected from December 2016 to February 2018, and data were analyzed from April 2018 to May 2019.
Participants received 40 mg/kg (low dose) or 80 mg/kg (high dose) of viltolarsen administered by weekly intravenous infusion.
Primary outcomes of the trial included safety, tolerability, and de novo dystrophin protein production measured by Western blot in participants' biceps muscles. Secondary outcomes included additional assessments of dystrophin mRNA and protein production as well as clinical muscle strength and function.
Of the 16 included boys with DMD, 15 (94%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 7.4 (1.8) years. After 20 to 24 weeks of treatment, significant drug-induced dystrophin production was seen in both viltolarsen dose cohorts (40 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.7% [3.2-10.3] of normal; 80 mg/kg per week: mean [range] 5.9% [1.1-14.4] of normal).

To date, we have completed an investigator-initiated first-in-human study at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry based on the systemic injection of the morpholino oligonucleotides which are prone to exon-53 skipping. For the effective treatment of DMD, in vitro testing with myoblasts derived from DMD patients to screen drugs and assess patient eligibility before undertaking clinical trials is thought to be essential. Very recently, we reported a new MYOD1-converted urine-derived cell (UDC) treated with the histone methyltransferase inhibitor (3-deazaneplanocin A hydrochloride), as a cellular model of DMD. The new autologous UDC might show phenocopy of the disease-specific phenotypes of DMD, leading to the application of precision medicine in a variety of muscle-related diseases.

In recent years, the application of new genetic technologies and the availability of new personalised drugs have influenced diagnostic genetic testing for dystrophinopathies. Therefore, these European best practice guidelines for genetic testing in dystrophinopathies have been produced to update previous guidelines published in 2010.These guidelines summarise current recommended technologies and methodologies for analysis of the DMD gene, including testing for deletions and duplications of one or more exons, small variant detection and RNA analysis. Genetic testing strategies for diagnosis, carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis (including non-invasive prenatal diagnosis) are then outlined. Guidelines for sequence variant annotation and interpretation are provided, followed by recommendations for reporting results of all categories of testing.

32407333,Serum glutamate dehydrogenase activity enables early detection of liver injury in subjects with underlying muscle impairments.,,PloS one,"Serum activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) are used as gold standard biomarkers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular injury. Since ALT and AST lack liver specificity, the diagnosis of the onset of hepatocellular injury in patients with underlying muscle impairments is severely limited. Thus, we evaluated the potential of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) as a liver specific alternative biomarker of hepatocellular injury. In our study, serum GLDH in subjects with Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD) was equivalent to serum GLDH in age matched healthy subjects, while serum ALT was increased 20-fold in DMD subjects. Furthermore, serum GLDH in 131 subjects with variety of muscle impairments was similar to serum GLDH of healthy subjects while serum ALT corelated with serum creatine kinase, a widely accepted biomarker of muscle impairment. In addition, significant elevations of ALT, AST, and CK were observed in a case of a patient with rhabdomyolysis, while serum GLDH stayed within the normal range until the onset of hypoxia-induced liver injury. In a mouse model of DMD (DMDmdx), serum GLDH but not serum ALT clearly correlated with the degree of acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Taken together, our data support the utility of serum GLDH as a liver-specific biomarker of liver injury that has a potential to improve diagnosis of hepatocellular injury in patients with underlying muscle impairments. In drug development, GLDH may have utility as a biomarker of drug induced liver injury in clinical trials of new therapies to treat muscle diseases such as DMD.",,,,2020-05-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The differential impact of frequently used CSs and their regimens on long-term (> 5 years) cardiorespiratory progression in children with DMD is unknown.
This was a retrospective longitudinal study including children with DMD followed at Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital London, England, from May 2000 to June 2017. Patients enrolled in any interventional clinical trials were excluded. We collected patients' anthropometrics and respiratory (FVC, FVC % predicted and absolute FVC, and noninvasive ventilation requirement [NIV]) and cardiac (left ventricular shortening function [LVFS%]) function. CSs-naïve patients had never received CSs. Patients who were treated with CSs took either deflazacort or prednisolone, daily or intermittently (10 days on/10 days off) for > 1 month. Average longitudinal models were fitted for yearly respiratory (FVC % predicted) and cardiac (LVFS%) progression. A time-to-event analysis to FVC % predicted < 50%, NIV start, and cardiomyopathy (LVFS% < 28%) was performed in CS-treated (daily and intermittent) vs CS-naïve patients.

We collected pulmonary function testing (PFT) data from a large retrospective cohort followed at Centers collaborating in the Italian DMD Network. Furthermore, we analyzed PFT associations with different DMD mutation types, and with genetic variants in SPP1, LTBP4, CD40, and ACTN3, known to modify skeletal muscle weakness in DMD. Genetic association findings were independently validated in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS).
Generalized estimating equation analysis of 1852 PFTs from 327 Italian DMD patients, over an average follow-up time of 4.5 years, estimated that forced vital capacity (FVC) declined yearly by -4.2%, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec by -5.0%, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) by -2.9%. Glucocorticoid (GC) treatment was associated with higher values of all PFT measures (approximately + 15% across disease stages). Mutations situated 3' of DMD intron 44, thus predicted to alter the expression of short dystrophin isoforms, were associated with lower (approximately -6%) PFT values, a finding independently validated in the CINRG-DNHS. Deletions amenable to skipping of exon 51 and 53 were independently associated with worse PFT outcomes. A meta-analysis of the two cohorts identified detrimental effects of SPP1 rs28357094 and CD40 rs1883832 minor alleles on both FVC and PEF.
These findings support GC efficacy in delaying respiratory insufficiency, and will be useful for the design and interpretation of clinical trials focused on respiratory endpoints in DMD.",,,,2020-04-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

For accurate endpoint analysis, it is essential to have reliable, robust and objective quantification methodologies capable of detecting subtle changes in dystrophin expression. In this work, we present further development and optimisation of an automated, digital, high-throughput script for quantitative analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescent (IF) whole slide images (WSI) of dystrophin, dystrophin associated proteins (DAPs) and regenerating myofibres (fetal/developmental myosin-positive) in transverse sections of DMD, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and control skeletal muscle biopsies. The script enables extensive automated assessment of myofibre morphometrics, protein quantification by fluorescence intensity and sarcolemmal circumference coverage, colocalisation data for dystrophin and DAPs and regeneration at the single myofibre and whole section level. Analysis revealed significant variation in dystrophin intensity, percentage coverage and amounts of DAPs between differing DMD and BMD samples. Accurate identification of dystrophin via a novel background subtraction method allowed differential assessment of DAP fluorescence intensity within dystrophin positive compared to dystrophin negative sarcolemma regions. This enabled surrogate quantification of molecular functionality of dystrophin in the assembly of the DAP complex. Overall, the digital script is capable of multiparametric and unbiased analysis of markers of myofibre regeneration and dystrophin in relation to key DAPs and enabled better characterisation of the heterogeneity in dystrophin expression patterns seen in BMD and DMD alongside the surrogate assessment of molecular functionality of dystrophin. Both these aspects will be of significant relevance to ongoing and future DMD and other muscular dystrophies clinical trials to help benchmark therapeutic efficacy.",,,,2020-04-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Promising therapies for DMD are being developed, but the long lead times required when using clinical outcome measures are hindering progress. This progress would be facilitated by robust molecular biomarkers in biofluids, such as blood and urine, which could be used to monitor disease progression and severity, as well as to determine optimal drug dosing before a full clinical trial. Many candidate DMD biomarkers have been identified, but there have been few follow-up studies to validate them. This Review describes the promising biomarkers for dystrophic muscle that have been identified in muscle, mainly using animal models. We strongly focus on myonecrosis and the associated inflammation and oxidative stress in DMD muscle, as the lack of dystrophin causes repeated bouts of myonecrosis, which are the key events that initiate the resultant severe dystropathology. We discuss the early events of intrinsic myonecrosis, along with early regeneration in the context of histological and other measures that are used to quantify its incidence. Molecular biomarkers linked to the closely associated events of inflammation and oxidative damage are discussed, with a focus on research related to protein thiol oxidation and to neutrophils.

Primary biological outcome measures of part 2 were blinded exon skipping and dystrophin protein production on muscle biopsies (baseline, week 48) evaluated, respectively, using reverse transcription PCR and Western blot and immunohistochemistry.
Twelve patients were randomized to receive golodirsen (n = 8) or placebo (n = 4) in part 1. All from part 1 plus 13 additional patients received 30 mg/kg golodirsen in part 2. Safety findings were consistent with those previously observed in pediatric patients with DMD. Most of the study drug was excreted within 4 hours following administration. A significant increase in exon 53 skipping was associated with ∼16-fold increase over baseline in dystrophin protein expression at week 48, with a mean percent normal dystrophin protein standard of 1.019% (range, 0.09%-4.30%). Sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin was demonstrated by significantly increased dystrophin-positive fibers (week 48, 
Golodirsen was well-tolerated; muscle biopsies from golodirsen-treated patients showed increased exon 53 skipping, dystrophin production, and correct dystrophin sarcolemmal localization.

The condition affects nearly 1 in 3,500 males worldwide. Current therapeutics have not been sufficient in providing a cure or resulting in a significant extension in life expectancy, but many therapeutic options are currently under investigation.
This article provides an overview of the current and emerging therapies for DMD giving particular focus to synthetic therapeutic options. The authors further provide their expert opinion.
Many discrepancies in primary outcomes of trials have led to questions of efficacy for medications, as well as difficulty in securing FDA approval. A standardization of primary outcome strategies, as well as better access to investigational medications, may alleviate some of the controversy and pressures that exist on medication approvals. Many trials have identified cohorts who responded more favorably to medications, despite a lack of significance in the overall intent-to-treat populations. This indicates that more medication screening and personalized treatment with patient-specific targeting might deliver more clinically significant results.",,,,2020-03-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Gait speed is an indicator of health and disability, yet gait is a complex, multi-faceted activity. Using the International Classification of Function, Health and Disability (ICF) model, assessment of gait and functional ambulation should consider the impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions due to disease, and factors related to the environment and the individual person.
This narrative review involved a literature search of databases including Medline, Embase and Pubmed from 1946 to October 2019. Inclusion criteria included assessments of gait, endurance and ambulatory function in paediatric (0-18 years) neuromuscular diseases.
Fifty-two papers were identified reporting assessments of gait speed, timed function, endurance and ambulatory capacity, gait-related balance and qualitative descriptive assessments of gait function and effect of disease on gait and gait-related activities. Gait speed is an indicator of disability and children with neuromuscular disease walk slower than typically developing peers. Increasing disease severity and age were associated with slower walking in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The six-minute walk test is used widely as a test of endurance and ambulatory capacity; six-minute walk distance was substantially reduced across all paediatric neuromuscular diseases. Endurance and ambulatory capacity was more limited in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 3, congenital muscular dystrophy and older boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Only a few papers considered normalisation of gait parameters accounting for the effect on gait of height in heterogeneous groups of children and linear growth in longitudinal studies. Balance related to gait was considered in five papers, mainly in children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. There was limited investigation of factors including distance requirements and terrain in children's typical environments and personal factors related to self-perception of disease effect on gait and gait-related function.
Assessments of gait and functional ambulation are important considerations in documenting disease progression and treatment efficacy in the clinical setting; and in clinical trials of disease-modifying agents and physiotherapeutic interventions in paediatric neuromuscular diseases. There is a need for expert consensus on core gait and functional ambulation assessments for use in clinical and research settings.",,"Fifty-two papers were identified reporting assessments of gait speed, timed function, endurance and ambulatory capacity, gait-related balance and qualitative descriptive assessments of gait function and effect of disease on gait and gait-related activities.

NBS for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has been a controversial matter for many years, because of false positives, the lack of effective drugs and the need of more data about screening efficacy. The still high diagnostic delay of DMD and the current availability of drugs such as steroid, ataluren, eteplirsen, golodirsen and forthcoming new drugs, improving the clinical conditions if early started, make appropriate to begin a concrete discussion between stakeholders to identify best practice for DMD screening. A two-step system CK/DNA screening programme is presented to be performed in male infants aged between 6 months and 42 months involving more than 30,000 male infants.

We investigated whether rhIGF-1 therapy: 1) improves or preserves muscle function; and 2) improves growth in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
In this study we compared prepubescent, ambulatory, glucocorticoid-treated boys with DMD (n = 17) vs controls (glucocorticoid therapy only, n = 21) in a 6-month-long, prospective, randomized, controlled trial of subcutaneous rhIGF-1 therapy. The primary outcome was 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Secondary outcomes included height velocity (HV), change in height standard deviation score (ΔHtSDS), motor function, cardiopulmonary function, body composition, insulin sensitivity, quality of life, and safety.
Change in 6MWD was similar between groups (rhIGF-1 vs controls [mean ± SD]: 3.4 ± 32.4 vs -5.1 ± 50.2 meters, P = .53). Treated subjects grew more than controls (HV: 6.5 ± 1.7 vs 3.3 ± 1.3 cm/year, P < .0001; 6-month ΔHtSDS: 0.25, P < .0001). Lean mass and insulin sensitivity increased in treated subjects.

However, published evidence is inconclusive and some estimates may be obsolete due to improvements in standards of care, in particular the routine use of mechanical ventilatory support in advanced stages of the disease. In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO identifier: CRD42019121800), we searched MEDLINE (through PubMed), CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for studies published from inception up until December 31, 2018, reporting results of life expectancy in DMD. We pooled median survival estimates from individual studies using the median of medians, and weighted median of medians, methods. Risk of bias was established with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results were stratified by ventilatory support and risk of bias. We identified 15 publications involving 2662 patients from 12 countries from all inhabited continents except Africa. Median life expectancy without ventilatory support ranged between 14.4 and 27.0 years (pooled median: 19.0 years, 95% CI 18.0-20.9; weighted pooled median: 19.4 years, 18.2-20.1). Median life expectancy with ventilatory support, introduced in most settings in the 1990s, ranged between 21.0 and 39.6 years (pooled median: 29.9 years, 26.5-30.8; weighted pooled median: 31.8 years, 29.3-36.2). Risk of bias had little impact on pooled results. In conclusion, median life expectancy at birth in DMD seems to have improved considerably during the last decades.

We surveyed 10 pairs of DMD participants and their parents within this clinical trial via an iPad survey form and through interviews regarding their understanding of the trial, expectations, anxieties, and reasons for participating in the trial. Approximately half of the participants actively decided to participate of their own volition, and none considered quitting the trial. This indicates that participants participated more positively in this clinical trial than previously expected. However, some potential concerns were also revealed, with one being that the desire to please those around them might be more important to the DMD participants than the effects of the drug. Another issue is the possibility of biased information originating from the study subjects' parents; while seven out of 10 of the parents told their children that the study drug might work, only four of these parents also explained that it might not work.

VL FFs were determined on longitudinal Dixon MRI scans from 2 natural history studies in Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). CCHMC included ambulant patients, while LUMC included a mixed ambulant and nonambulant population. We fitted longitudinal VL FF values to a sigmoidal curve using a mixed model with random slope to predict individual trajectories. The additive value of VL FF over age to predict LoA was calculated from a Cox model, yielding a hazard ratio.
Eighty-nine MRIs of 19 LUMC and 15 CCHMC patients were included.

Clinical trials have shown to be largely underpowered due to inter-individual variability and noisy outcome measures. The availability of biomarkers able to anticipate clinical benefit is highly needed to improve clinical trial design and facilitate drug development.
In this study, we aimed to appraise the value of protein biomarkers to predict prognosis and monitor disease progression or treatment outcome in patients affected by DMD. We collected clinical data and 303 blood samples from 157 DMD patients in three clinical centres; 78 patients contributed multiple blood samples over time, with a median follow-up time of 2 years. We employed linear mixed models to identify biomarkers that are associated with disease progression, wheelchair dependency, and treatment with corticosteroids and performed survival analysis to find biomarkers whose levels are associated with time to loss of ambulation.
Our analysis led to the identification of 21 proteins whose levels significantly decrease with age and nine proteins whose levels significantly increase. Seven of these proteins are also differentially expressed in non-ambulant patients, and three proteins are differentially expressed in patients treated with glucocorticosteroids. Treatment with corticosteroids was found to partly counteract the effect of disease progression on two biomarkers, namely, malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2, P = 0.0003) and ankyrin repeat domain 2 (P = 0.0005); however, patients treated with corticosteroids experienced a further reduction on collagen 1 serum levels (P = 0.0003), especially following administration of deflazacort. A time to event analysis allowed to further support the use of MDH2 as a prognostic biomarker as it was associated with an increased risk of wheelchair dependence (P = 0.0003). The obtained data support the prospective evaluation of the identified biomarkers in natural history and clinical trials as exploratory biomarkers.
We identified a number of serum biomarkers associated with disease progression, loss of ambulation, and treatment with corticosteroids.

Effective assessment of disease burden, natural history progression, and response to therapy in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy are critical factors for clinical trial success. By choosing optimal biomarkers to better assess therapeutic efficacy, study costs and sample size requirements can be reduced. Currently, functional measures continue to serve as the primary outcome for the majority of DMD clinical trials. Quantitative measures of muscle health, including magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, electrical impedance myography, and ultrasound, sensitively identify diseased muscle, disease progression, and response to a therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, such non-invasive techniques have the potential to identify disease pathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Despite robust supportive evidence, non-invasive quantitative techniques are still not frequently utilized in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Non-invasive quantitative techniques have demonstrated the ability to quantify disease progression and potential response to therapeutic intervention, and should be used as a supplement to current standard functional measures.

In the ambulatory group, EIM 100 kHz resistance values showed significant change compared to the healthy boys. For example, in lower extremity muscles, the average change in EIM 100 kHz resistance values over 12 months led to an estimated effect size of 1.58. Based on these results, 26 DMD patients/arm would be needed for a 12-month clinical trial assuming a 50% treatment effect. In non-ambulatory boys, EIM changes were greater in upper limb muscles. For example, biceps at 100kHz resistance gave an estimated effect size of 1.92 at 12 months.

The aim of this review is to provide systematically current literature evidence about the effects of different treatment options (available or under development) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy on the pulmonary function of these patients.
A comprehensive search was undertaken using multiple health-related databases, while two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of studies. A third person addressed any disagreements between reviewers. The quality of the methodology of the included studies was also assessed.
A total of 19 original research papers (nine evaluating the role of steroids, six idebenone, three eteplirsen, one stem-cell therapy, and one ataluren) were found to fulfill our selection criteria with the majority of them (14 of 19) being prospective studies, not always including a control group. Endpoints mainly used in these studies were values of pulmonary function tests. Current and under development treatments proved to be safe and no significant adverse events were reported. A beneficial impact on pulmonary function was described by authors in the majority of these studies. The principal effect was slowing of lung disease progress, as expressed by spirometric values. However, the risk of bias was introduced in many of the above studies, while high heterogeneity in terms of treatment protocols and outcome measures limits the comparability of the results.

Published evidence of efficacy for idebenone on respiratory function outcomes is currently limited to 12 months of follow-up time. Here we report data collected as retrospective cohort study (SYROS) from 18 DMD patients not using glucocorticoids who were treated with idebenone (900 mg/day) under Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). The objective was to assess the long-term respiratory function evolution for periods On-Idebenone compared to periods Off-Idebenone in the same patients. The mean idebenone exposure in the EAPs was 4.2 (range 2.4-6.1) years. The primary endpoint was the annual change in forced vital capacity percent of predicted (FVC%p) compared between Off-Idebenone and On-Idebenone periods. The annual rate of decline in FVC%p was reduced by approximately 50% from -7.4% (95% CI: -9.1, -5.8) for the Off-Idebenone periods to -3.8% (95% CI: -4.8, -2.8) for the On-Idebenone periods (N = 11). Similarly, annual change in peak expiratory flow percent of predicted (PEF%p) was -5.9% (95% CI: -8.0, -3.9) for the Off-Idebenone periods (N = 9) and reduced to -1.9% (95% CI: -3.2, -0.7) for the On-Idebenone periods during the EAPs. The reduced rates of decline in FVC%p and PEF%p were maintained for several years with possible beneficial effects on the rate of bronchopulmonary adverse events, time to 10% decline in FVC%p and risk of hospitalization due to respiratory cause.

31808555,Strength training and aerobic exercise training for muscle disease.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Strength training or aerobic exercise programmes, or both, might optimise muscle and cardiorespiratory function and prevent additional disuse atrophy and deconditioning in people with a muscle disease. This is an update of a review first published in 2004 and last updated in 2013. We undertook an update to incorporate new evidence in this active area of research.
To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of strength training and aerobic exercise training in people with a muscle disease.
We searched Cochrane Neuromuscular's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL in November 2018 and clinical trials registries in December 2018.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs or cross-over RCTs comparing strength or aerobic exercise training, or both lasting at least six weeks, to no training in people with a well-described muscle disease diagnosis.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
We included 14 trials of aerobic exercise, strength training, or both, with an exercise duration of eight to 52 weeks, which included 428 participants with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), dermatomyositis, polymyositis, mitochondrial myopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), or myotonic dystrophy. Risk of bias was variable, as blinding of participants was not possible, some trials did not blind outcome assessors, and some did not use an intention-to-treat analysis. Strength training compared to no training (3 trials) For participants with FSHD (35 participants), there was low-certainty evidence of little or no effect on dynamic strength of elbow flexors (MD 1.2 kgF, 95% CI -0.2 to 2.6), on isometric strength of elbow flexors (MD 0.5 kgF, 95% CI -0.7 to 1.8), and ankle dorsiflexors (MD 0.4 kgF, 95% CI -2.4 to 3.2), and on dynamic strength of ankle dorsiflexors (MD -0.4 kgF, 95% CI -2.3 to 1.4). For participants with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (35 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence of a slight improvement in isometric wrist extensor strength (MD 8.0 N, 95% CI 0.7 to 15.3) and of little or no effect on hand grip force (MD 6.0 N, 95% CI -6.7 to 18.7), pinch grip force (MD 1.0 N, 95% CI -3.3 to 5.3) and isometric wrist flexor force (MD 7.0 N, 95% CI -3.4 to 17.4). Aerobic exercise training compared to no training (5 trials) For participants with DMD there was very low-certainty evidence regarding the number of leg revolutions (MD 14.0, 95% CI -89.0 to 117.0; 23 participants) or arm revolutions (MD 34.8, 95% CI -68.2 to 137.8; 23 participants), during an assisted six-minute cycle test, and very low-certainty evidence regarding muscle strength (MD 1.7, 95% CI -1.9 to 5.3; 15 participants). For participants with FSHD, there was low-certainty evidence of improvement in aerobic capacity (MD 1.1 L/min, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.8, 38 participants) and of little or no effect on knee extension strength (MD 0.1 kg, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.9, 52 participants). For participants with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (14 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence regarding aerobic capacity (MD 14.6, 95% CI -1.0 to 30.2). Combined aerobic exercise and strength training compared to no training (6 trials) For participants with juvenile dermatomyositis (26 participants) there was low-certainty evidence of an improvement in knee extensor strength on the right (MD 36.0 N, 95% CI 25.0 to 47.1) and left (MD 17 N 95% CI 0.5 to 33.5), but low-certainty evidence of little or no effect on maximum force of hip flexors on the right (MD -9.0 N, 95% CI -22.4 to 4.4) or left (MD 6.0 N, 95% CI -6.6 to 18.6). This trial also provided low-certainty evidence of a slight decrease of aerobic capacity (MD -1.2 min, 95% CI -1.6 to 0.9). For participants with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (21 participants), we found very low-certainty evidence for slight increases in muscle strength as measured by dynamic strength of knee extensors on the right (MD 2.5 kg, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.3) and on the left (MD 2.7 kg, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.4) and no clear effect in isometric muscle strength of eight different muscles (MD 1.0, 95% CI -1.1 to 3.1). There was very low-certainty evidence that there may be an increase in aerobic capacity, as measured with time to exhaustion in an incremental cycle test (17.5 min, 95% CI 8.0 to 27.0) and power performed at VO
The evidence regarding strength training and aerobic exercise interventions remains uncertain. Evidence suggests that strength training alone may have little or no effect, and that aerobic exercise training alone may lead to a possible improvement in aerobic capacity, but only for participants with FSHD. For combined aerobic exercise and strength training, there may be slight increases in muscle strength and aerobic capacity for people with dermatomyositis and polymyositis, and a slight decrease in aerobic capacity and increase in muscle strength for people with juvenile dermatomyositis. More research with robust methodology and greater numbers of participants is still required.",,,,2019-12-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Several targeted gene therapies and molecular approaches have been or are currently being tested in clinical trials; however, a causative therapy is still not available and best supportive care is limited to oral glucocorticoids with numerous long-term side effects. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor regulator, and shows antioxidant actions and regulatory roles in the calcium homeostasis besides its antitumor activity. In a mouse model of DMD, oral tamoxifen significantly improved muscle strength and reduced muscle fatigue. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial aims to demonstrate safety and efficacy of tamoxifen over placebo in pediatric patients with DMD. After completion of the double-blind phase, an open-label extension of the study will be offered to all participants.
At least 71 ambulant and up to 20 nonambulant patients with DMD are planned to be enrolled at multiple European sites. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either tamoxifen 20 mg or placebo daily over 48 weeks. In the open-label extension phase, all patients will be offered tamoxifen for a further 48 weeks. The primary endpoint of the double-blind phase is defined as the change of the D1 domain of the motor function measure in ambulant patients or a change of the D2 domain in nonambulant patients under tamoxifen compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures include change in timed function tests, quantitative muscle testing, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of thigh muscles. Laboratory analyses including biomarkers of tamoxifen metabolism and muscle dystrophy will also be assessed.
The aim of the study is to investigate whether tamoxifen can reduce disease progression in ambulant and nonambulant patients with DMD over 48 weeks. Motor function measures comprise the primary endpoint, whereas further clinical and radiological assessments and laboratory biomarkers are performed to provide more data on safety and efficacy. An adjacent open-label extension phase is planned to test if earlier initiation of the treatment with tamoxifen (verum arm of double-blind phase) compared to a delayed start can reduce disease progression more efficiently.

It is caused by a lack of dystrophin protein due to mutations in the DMD gene, which can disrupt the reading frame of the dystrophin primary transcript. Antisense oligonucleotides such as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) can induce exon skipping during pre-mRNA splicing and restore the reading frame of the DMD primary transcript. The resulting dystrophin protein is internally deleted but partially functional. Viltolarsen, also known as NS-065/NCNP-01, is a PMO developed through comprehensive sequence optimization and is designed to skip exon 53 on the DMD primary transcript. Exclusion of exon 53 from the DMD primary transcript can treat 8-10% of DMD patients worldwide.

The treatment of DMD remains an unmet medical need.
To evaluate the benefits and harms of a combination of l-citrulline and metformin treatment among patients with DMD.
A single-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trial was conducted between December 12, 2013, and March 30, 2016, at the University Children's Hospital Basel in Switzerland. A total of 47 ambulant male patients aged 6.5 to 10 years with genetically confirmed DMD were recruited locally and from the patient registries of Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and France. Data were analyzed from April 6, 2016, to September 5, 2019.
Patients in the treatment group received 2500 mg of l-citrulline and 250 mg of metformin (combination therapy) 3 times a day for 26 weeks compared with patients in the control group, who received placebo.
The primary end point was the change in transfer and standing posture, as assessed by the first dimension of the Motor Function Measure, version 32, from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included assessments of timed function, quantitative muscle force, biomarkers for muscle necrosis, and adverse events. The 2 prespecified subgroups comprised patients who were able to walk 350 m or more in 6 minutes (stable subgroup) and patients who were not able to walk 350 m in 6 minutes (unstable subgroup) at baseline.
Among 49 ambulant male children with DMD who were screened for eligibility, 47 patients with a mean (SD) age of 8.2 (1.1) years were randomized to a treatment group receiving combination therapy (n = 23) or a control group receiving placebo (n = 24), and 45 patients completed the study. No significant differences between groups were found in the results of timed function and muscle force tests for overall, proximal and axial, and distal motor function. Among patients receiving combination therapy, the Motor Function Measure first dimension subscore decrease was 5.5% greater than that of patients receiving placebo (95% CI, -1.0% to 12.1%; P = .09). The administration of combination therapy had significantly favorable effects on the first dimension subscore decrease among the 29 patients in the stable subgroup (6.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-12.6%; P = .03) but not among the 15 patients in the unstable subgroup (3.9%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 20.9%; P = .63). Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with only mild adverse effects.
Treatment with combination therapy was not associated with an overall reduction in motor function decline among ambulant patients with DMD; however, a reduction in motor function decline was observed among the stable subgroup of patients treated with combination therapy. The statistically nonsignificant difference of distal motor function in favor of combination therapy and the reduced degeneration of muscle tissue appear to support the treatment concept, but the study may have lacked sufficient statistical power. Further research exploring this treatment option with a greater number of patients is warranted.

However, one of the main differences between these trials is the microdystrophin protein produced following treatment. Each gene transfer product is based on different selections of dystrophin domain combinations to assemble microdystrophin transgenes that maintain functional dystrophin domains and fit within the packaging limits of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. While domains involved in mechanical function, such as the actin-binding domain and β-dystroglycan binding domain, have been identified for many years and included in microdystrophin constructs, more recently the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) domain has also been identified due to its role in enhancing nNOS membrane localization. As nNOS membrane localization has been established as an important requirement for prevention of functional ischemia in skeletal muscle, inclusion of the nNOS domain into a microdystrophin construct represents an important consideration. The aim of this mini review is to highlight what is currently known about the nNOS domain of dystrophin and to describe potential implications of this domain in a microdystrophin gene transfer clinical trial.",,,,2019-09-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
31487757,Respiratory muscle training in children and adults with neuromuscular disease.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting the anterior horn cell of spinal cord, neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerves and muscles. NMDs cause physical disability usually due to progressive loss of strength in limb muscles, and some NMDs also cause respiratory muscle weakness. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) might be expected to improve respiratory muscle weakness; however, the effects of RMT are still uncertain. This systematic review will synthesize the available trial evidence on the effectiveness and safety of RMT in people with NMD, to inform clinical practice.
To assess the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) for neuromuscular disease (NMD) in adults and children, in comparison to sham training, no training, standard treatment, breathing exercises, or other intensities or types of RMT.
On 19 November 2018, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. On 23 December 2018, we searched the US National Institutes for Health Clinical Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and reference lists of the included studies.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, including cross-over trials, of RMT in adults and children with a diagnosis of NMD of any degree of severity, who were living in the community, and who did not need mechanical ventilation. We compared trials of RMT (inspiratory muscle training (IMT) or expiratory muscle training (EMT), or both), with sham training, no training, standard treatment, different intensities of RMT, different types of RMT, or breathing exercises.
We followed standard Cochrane methodological procedures.
We included 11 studies involving 250 randomized participants with NMDs: three trials (N = 88) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; motor neuron disease), six trials (N = 112) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one trial (N = 23) in people with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and one trial (N = 27) in people with myasthenia gravis.Nine of the trials were at high risk of bias in at least one domain and many reported insufficient information for accurate assessment of the risk of bias. Populations, interventions, control interventions, and outcome measures were often different, which largely ruled out meta-analysis. All included studies assessed lung capacity, our primary outcome, but four did not provide data for analysis (1 in people with ALS and three cross-over studies in DMD). None provided long-term data (over a year) and only one trial, in ALS, provided information on adverse events. Unscheduled hospitalisations for chest infection or acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure were not reported and physical function and quality of life were reported in one (ALS) trial.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)Three trials compared RMT versus sham training in ALS. Short-term (8 weeks) effects of RMT on lung capacity in ALS showed no clear difference in the change of the per cent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) between EMT and sham EMT groups (mean difference (MD) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.48 to 9.88; N = 46; low-certainty evidence). The mean difference (MD) in FVC% after four months' treatment was 10.86% in favour of IMT (95% CI -4.25 to 25.97; 1 trial, N = 24; low-certainty evidence), which is larger than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID, as estimated in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). There was no clear difference between IMT and sham IMT groups, measured on the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALFRS; range of possible scores 0 = best to 40 = worst) (MD 0.85, 95% CI -2.16 to 3.85; 1 trial, N = 24; low-certainty evidence) or quality of life, measured on the EuroQol-5D (0 = worst to 100 = best) (MD 0.77, 95% CI -17.09 to 18.62; 1 trial, N = 24; low-certainty evidence) over the medium term (4 months). One trial report stated that the IMT protocol had no adverse effect (very low-certainty evidence).Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)Two DMD trials compared RMT versus sham training in young males with DMD. In one study, the mean post-intervention (6-week) total lung capacity (TLC) favoured RMT (MD 0.45 L, 95% CI -0.24 to 1.14; 1 trial, N = 16; low-certainty evidence). In the other trial there was no clear difference in post-intervention (18 days) FVC between RMT and sham RMT (MD 0.16 L, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.63; 1 trial, N = 20; low-certainty evidence). One RCT and three cross-over trials compared a form of RMT with no training in males with DMD; the cross-over trials did not provide suitable data. Post-intervention (6-month) values showed no clear difference between the RMT and no training groups in per cent predicted vital capacity (VC%) (MD 3.50, 95% CI -14.35 to 21.35; 1 trial, N = 30; low-certainty evidence).Becker or limb-girdle muscular dystrophyOne RCT (N = 21) compared 12 weeks of IMT with breathing exercises in people with Becker or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The evidence was of very low certainty and conclusions could not be drawn.Myasthenia gravisIn myasthenia gravis, there may be no clear difference between RMT and breathing exercises on measures of lung capacity, in the short term (TLC MD -0.20 L, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.67; 1 trial, N = 27; low-certainty evidence). Effects of RMT on quality of life are uncertain (1 trial; N = 27).Some trials reported effects of RMT on inspiratory and/or expiratory muscle strength; this evidence was also of low or very low certainty.
RMT may improve lung capacity and respiratory muscle strength in some NMDs. In ALS there may not be any clinically meaningful effect of RMT on physical functioning or quality of life and it is uncertain whether it causes adverse effects. Due to clinical heterogeneity between the trials and the small number of participants included in the analysis, together with the risk of bias, these results must be interpreted very cautiously.",,,,2019-09-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

31451516,Vamorolone trial in Duchenne muscular dystrophy shows dose-related improvement of muscle function.,,Neurology,"To study vamorolone, a first-in-class steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
An open-label, multiple-ascending-dose study of vamorolone was conducted in 48 boys with DMD (age 4-<7 years, steroid-naive). Dose levels were 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an oral suspension formulation (12 boys per dose level; one-third to 10 times the glucocorticoid dose in DMD). The primary goal was to define optimal doses of vamorolone. The primary outcome for clinical efficacy was time to stand from supine velocity.
Oral administration of vamorolone at all doses tested was safe and well tolerated over the 24-week treatment period. The 2.0-mg/kg/d dose group met the primary efficacy outcome of improved muscle function (time to stand; 24 weeks of vamorolone treatment vs natural history controls), without evidence of most adverse effects of glucocorticoids. A biomarker of bone formation, osteocalcin, increased in vamorolone-treated boys, suggesting possible loss of bone morbidities seen with glucocorticoids. Biomarker outcomes for adrenal suppression and insulin resistance were also lower in vamorolone-treated patients with DMD relative to published studies of glucocorticoid therapy.
Daily vamorolone treatment suggested efficacy at doses of 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/d in an exploratory 24-week open-label study.

In particular, the statistical distribution of fibers cross-sectional areas (CSAs) has been used as quantitative efficacy endpoint. For each patient, assessment of treatment effect relies on the comparison of pre- and post-treatment biopsies. Since biopsies provide ""distributional data"", i.e. empirical distributions of fibers CSA, the comparison must be carried out between the empirical pre- and post-treatment distributions.
Here, distributional fiber CSA data are analyzed by means of a hierarchical statistical model based on the population approach, considering both the single patient and the population level.
The proposed method was used to assess the histological clinical effects of Givinostat, a compound under study for DMD treatment. At the single patient level, a two-component Gaussian mixture adequately represents pre- and post-treatment distributions of log-transformed CSAs; drug effect is described via a dose-dependent multiplicative increase of muscle fiber size. The single patient model was also validated via muscle composition data. At the patient population level, typical model parameters and inter-patient variabilities were obtained.

Many trials require muscle biopsies, which involve an invasive surgical procedure. Little is known about short- and long-term impacts of muscle biopsies as perceived by patients and caregivers. Therefore a survey was held among patients and their caregivers who participated in trials involving muscle biopsies, in seven countries. Seventy-eight responses were received. Analysis revealed that many patients and parents had significant anxiety before the biopsy. The main concern of caregivers was the required general anaesthesia. In most cases biopsies caused pain and temporarily hampered daily activities. The main long-term impact was scarring, although large variation in size was reported. Seventy-nine percent of caregivers were little bothered and 21% were moderately or severely bothered by the scar. Willingness to consider another biopsy in future protocols was higher for open-label studies than for placebo-controlled trials. Caregivers stressed the importance of knowing the results of biopsy analyses; only a minority actually received this information. Recommendations are made on the informed consent procedure regarding risks and consequences of muscle biopsies, and communication of results.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is among the most common rare pediatric disorders, and clinical trials of therapeutic approaches have seen dramatic expansion. Pharmacotherapeutic standard of care has been limited to off-label prescription of high-dose, daily corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort). Deflazacort received FDA approval for DMD in 2016, although the price increases associated with formal FDA approval and the severe side effects associated with corticosteroid use have limited patient/physician uptake and insurance coverage in the USA. In Europe, EMA has given conditional marketing authorization for prescription of Translarna (a stop codon read-through drug prescribed to ~10% of DMD patients), although there is not yet evidence of clinical efficacy. The FDA awarded conditional approval to etiplirsen, an exon-skipping oligonucleotide drug, based on accelerated pathways (increased dystrophin production in patient muscle). Evidence of clinical efficacy remains the focus of post-marketing studies. There are many innovative pharmacotherapies under clinical development for DMD (Phase I, II, and III clinical trials). All are ""disease modifying"" in the sense that none seek to replace the full-length, normal DMD gene or dystrophin protein, but instead either seek to introduce an abnormal ""Becker-like"" version of the gene or protein or target pathophysiological pathways downstream of the primary defect. It is envisioned that the most significant benefit to DMD patients will be through multidrug approaches simultaneously aiming to introduce partially functional dystrophin in patient muscle while also targeting both chronic inflammation and the fibrofatty replacement of muscle.",,,,2019-08-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
31343429,Update in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.,,Current opinion in neurology,"The purpose of this review is to highlight updates in the standard of care recommendations for DMD, and to describe approaches to and recent advances in genetic therapies for DMD.
Treatment of DMD patients with the corticosteroids prednisone or deflazacort remains the standard of care, and recent data shows that early treatment (as young as 5 months) with a weekend dosing regimen results in measurable improvement in motor outcomes. A mutation-specific therapy directed at restoring an open reading frame by skipping exon 51 is FDA-approved, and therapies directed at other exons are in trials. Gene replacement therapy shows significant promise in animal models, and trials are underway. Genome editing has received significant attention because of results in animal models, but challenges to implementation in humans remain.
The mainstay of treatment remains meeting well defined standards of care that have been shown to influence morbidity and mortality. These include use of systemic steroids, early nocturnal ventilatory support, appropriate cardiac care and prophylaxis, and wherever appropriate, scoliosis surgery. Early and accurate molecular diagnosis, along with appropriate and multidisciplinary care, provides the best opportunity for maximum benefit of both current standard and upcoming novel therapies for boys with DMD.

Patient- and health care provider-driven data collections are held with different organizations behind firewalls to protect the privacy of patients. They tend to be fragmented, incomplete and their aggregation leads to further inaccuracies, as the duplicated records cannot easily be identified. We here report about a novel approach to evaluate the incidences of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in Germany.
We performed a retrospective epidemiological study collecting data from patients with dystrophinopathies (DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy) and SMA born between 1995 and 2018. We invited all neuromuscular centers, genetic institutes and the patient registries for DMD and SMA in Germany to participate in the data collection. A novel web-based application for data entry was developed converting patient identifying information into a hash code. Duplicate entries were reliably allocated to the distinct patient.
We collected 5409 data entries in our web-based database representing 1955 distinct patients with dystrophinopathies and 1287 patients with SMA. 55.0% of distinct patients were found in one of the 3 data sources only, while 32.0% were found in 2, and 13.0% in all 3 data sources. The highest number of SMA patients was reported by genetic testing laboratories, while for DMD the highest number was reported by the clinical specialist centers. After the removal of duplicate records, the highest yearly incidence for DMD was calculated as 2.57:10,000 in 2001 and the highest incidence for SMA as 1.36:10,000 in 2014.
With our novel approach (compliant with data protection regulations), we were able to identify unique patient records and estimate the incidence of DMD and SMA in Germany combining and de-duplicating data from patient registries, genetic institutes, and clinical care centers.

To develop a tool to assess, validate and compare the clinical translatability of animal models used for the preliminary assessment of efficacy.
We performed a scoping review to identify the key aspects used to validate animal models. Eight domains (Epidemiology, Symptomatology and Natural History-SNH, Genetic, Biochemistry, Aetiology, Histology, Pharmacology and Endpoints) were identified. We drafted questions to evaluate the different facets of human disease simulation. We designed the Framework to Identify Models of Disease (FIMD) to include standardised instructions, a weighting and scoring system to compare models as well as factors to help interpret model similarity and evidence uncertainty. We also added a reporting quality and risk of bias assessment of drug intervention studies in the Pharmacological Validation domain. A web-based survey was conducted with experts from different stakeholders to gather input on the framework. We conducted a pilot study of the validation in two models for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)-the ZDF rat and db/db mouse. Finally, we present a full validation and comparison of two animal models for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): the mdx mouse and GRMD dog.

31179493,Functional muscle recovery following dystrophin and myostatin exon splice modulation in aged mdx mice.,,Human molecular genetics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare genetic disease affecting 1 in 3500-5000 newborn boys. It is due to mutations in the DMD gene with a consequent lack of dystrophin protein that leads to deterioration of myofibres and their replacement with fibro-adipogenic tissue. Out-of-frame mutations in the DMD gene can be modified by using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to promote skipping of specific exons such that the reading frame is restored and the resulting protein produced, though truncated, is functional. We have shown that AONs can also be used to knock down myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth and differentiation, through disruption of the transcript reading frame, and thereby enhance muscle strength. In young mdx mice, combined dystrophin and myostatin exon skipping therapy greatly improved DMD pathology, compared to the single dystrophin skipping approach. Here we show that in aged (>15-month-old) mdx mice, when the pathology is significantly more severe and more similar to the one observed in DMD patients, the effect of the combined therapy is slightly attenuated but still beneficial in improving the disease phenotype. These results confirm the beneficial outcome of the combination approach and support its translation into DMD clinical trials.",,,,2019-06-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

This makes development of clinical trial protocols difficult and contributes to the uncertainty around whether or not a potential therapy is efficacious. The use of data standards to aggregate data from multiple sources, and the use of such integrated databases to develop statistical models can inform protocol development and reduce the risks in developing new therapies. Achieving regulatory endorsement of such models through defined pathways at the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Authority allows such tools to be used by the drug development community for defined contexts of use without further need for discussion of the underlying model(s). The Duchenne Regulatory Science Consortium (D-RSC) has brought together multiple stakeholders to develop a clinical trial simulation tool for Duchenne muscular dystrophy using such an approach. Here we describe the work of D-RSC as an example of how such an approach may be effective at reducing uncertainty in drug development for rare diseases, and thus bringing effective therapies to patients faster.",,,,2019-05-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Testosterone, the main circulating androgen in men, promotes virilisation and growth with associated accrual of fat-free muscle mass and bone mineral content. Testosterone therapy is routinely used to mimic the normal stages of pubertal development in patients with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, androgen deficiency secondary to testicular disease and in constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP). Improved life expectancy in DMD has meant that more adolescents are eligible for testosterone supplementation but there is little objective data regarding the impact of this treatment on muscle structure and function, bone integrity and overall well-being.
This is a single centre observational clinical trial (NCT02571205) that aims to follow the progress of 15 adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and delayed puberty as they are managed with incremental testosterone therapy to induce puberty. Subjects will all be treated with a steadily increasing dose of testosterone administered by injection every 4 weeks and data will be collected to help us determine the effectiveness and tolerability of the described treatment regimen. We will use the data to explore the effects of testosterone on pubertal development, growth, muscle strength and function, bone mineral density, body composition with a detailed record of any adverse events. We will also carry out interviews to explore the boys' views on the tolerability of the regimen. The study will last for 27 months in total for each participant.
Our experience has indicated that testosterone treatment in adolescents with DMD is liked and well tolerated but we have not collected objective data on a specific treatment regimen and there is no current consensus. Testosterone supplementation is not part of the standard of care of pubertal delay in DMD but inclusion in future protocols may be appropriate depending on the results of this trial.

30990876,The potential of utrophin and dystrophin combination therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Human molecular genetics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal neuromuscular disorder caused by loss of dystrophin. Several therapeutic modalities are currently in clinical trials but none will achieve maximum functional rescue and full disease correction. Therefore, we explored the potential of combining the benefits of dystrophin with increases of utrophin, an autosomal paralogue of dystrophin. Utrophin and dystrophin can be co-expressed and co-localized at the same muscle membrane. Wild-type (wt) levels of dystrophin are not significantly affected by a moderate increase of utrophin whereas higher levels of utrophin reduce wt dystrophin, suggesting a finite number of actin binding sites at the sarcolemma. Thus, utrophin upregulation strategies may be applied to the more mildly affected Becker patients with lower dystrophin levels. Whereas increased dystrophin in wt animals does not offer functional improvement, overexpression of utrophin in wt mice results in a significant supra-functional benefit over wt. These findings highlight an additive benefit of the combined therapy and potential new unique roles of utrophin. Finally, we show a 30% restoration of wt dystrophin levels, using exon-skipping, together with increased utrophin levels restores dystrophic muscle function to wt levels offering greater therapeutic benefit than either single approach alone. Thus, this combination therapy results in additive functional benefit and paves the way for potential future combinations of dystrophin- and utrophin-based strategies.",,,,2019-04-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A retrospective review of fracture morbidity and growth from 832 boys with DMD in the UK NorthStar database (2006-2015), which systematically captures information from 23 participating centers. A total of 564 boys had more than 1 visit. No numbers of boys who refused were collected, but informal data from 2 centers in London and from Scotland show that refusal is very low. Data were analyzed between October 2006 and October 2015.
Fracture incidence rate per 10 000 person-years was determined. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with first fracture.
Median age at baseline was 6.9 years (interquartile range, 4.9-7.2 years). At baseline, new fractures were reported in 7 of 564 participants (1.2%).

Although currently beset by several technical challenges, and not yet past small animal models, somatic genome editing may also be useful for a variety of cardiovascular disorders. It potentially avoids ethical concerns about permanent editing of the germline and allows treatment of already diseased individuals. If technical challenges of Cas9-gRNA delivery (viral vector immune response, nonviral vector delivery) can be worked out, then CRISPR-Cas9 may have a significant place in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders in which partial or complete gene knockout is desired. However, CRISPR may not work for gene correction in the human heart because of low rates of homology directed repair.

Total height (Ht), sitting height (SH), leg length (LL) and bone lengths (femur, tibia) in boys with DMD and age-matched control boys were measured using DXA. Thirty boys with DMD (median age 10.0 years (6.1, 16.8)) were compared with 30 controls. SH in DMD was 3.3 cm lower (95% CI - 6.1, - 0.66; p = 0.016). LL in DMD was 7.3 cm lower (95% CI - 11.2, - 3.4; p < 0.0001). SH:LL of boys with DMD was higher by 0.08 (95% CI 0.04, 0.12; p < 0.0001). Femur length in DMD was 2.4 cm lower (95% CI - 4.6, - 0.12; p = 0.04), whereas tibial length in DMD was 4.8 cm lower (95% CI - 6.7, - 2.9; p < 0.0001). SH:LL was not associated with duration of glucocorticoid use (SH:LL β = 0.003, 95% CI - 0.01 to 0.002, p = 0.72).Conclusion: Glucocorticoid-treated boys with DMD exhibit skeletal disproportion with relatively shorter leg length and more marked reduction of distal long bones. As glucocorticoid excess is not associated with such disproportion, our findings raise the possibility of an intrinsic disorder of growth in DMD. What is Known • Severe growth impairment and short stature are commonly observed in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), especially those treated with long-term glucocorticoids (GC). • In other groups of children with chronic conditions and/or disorders of puberty, skeletal disproportion with lower spinal length has been reported.

Vamorolone is a first-generation delta-9,11 compound that has favorable efficacy and side effect profiles relative to classical glucocorticoids. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral vamorolone were assessed in parallel-group studies in healthy men (phase 1, n = 86) and boys with DMD (phase 2a, n = 48) during 14 days of once-daily dosing with a range of doses. Vamorolone exhibited moderate variability in PK, with the maximum plasma concentration usually occurring at 2-4 hours and a half-life of approximately 2 hours for all doses and days examined. Population PK modeling of all data together indicated that the PK of vamorolone can be well described by a 1-compartment model with zero-order absorption. Both men and boys showed a dose-linearity of PK parameters for the doses examined, with no accumulation of the drug during daily dosing. Ingestion with food resulted in markedly enhanced absorption of the drug, as tested in healthy men. There were similar PK of vamorolone in healthy men and DMD boys with apparent clearance averaging 2.0 L/h/kg in men and 1.7 L/h/kg in boys. Overall, vamorolone exhibited well-behaved linear PK, with similar profiles in healthy men and boys with DMD, moderate variability in PK parameters, and absorption and disposition profiles similar to those of classical glucocorticoids.",,,,2019-02-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A limitation of AAV is the carrying capacity (∼5 kb) available for genes and regulatory cassettes (RCs). These size constraints are problematic for the 2.2-Mb dystrophin gene. We previously designed a variety of miniaturized micro-dystrophins (μDys) that displayed significant, albeit incomplete, function in striated muscles. To develop μDys proteins with improved performance, we explored structural modifications of the dystrophin central rod domain. Eight μDys variants were studied that carried unique combinations of between four and six of the 24 spectrin-like repeats present in the full-length protein, as well as various hinge domains. Expression of μDys was regulated by a strong but compact muscle-restricted RC (CK8e) or by the ubiquitously active cytomegalovirus (CMV) RC.

We present clinical and radiological outcome measures used in ambulatory patients participating in our trial ""Treatment with L-citrulline and metformin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy"". The motor function measure is a validated test in patients with neuromuscular disorders that consists of 32 items and assesses all three dimensions of motor performance including standing and transfer (D1 subscore), axial and proximal motor function (D2 subscore), and distal motor function (D3 subscore). The test shows high intra- and inter-rater variability but only when strictly following guidelines of the materials, examination steps, and calculation of scores. The 6-minute walk test, timed 10-meter walk/run test, and supine-up time are commonly used timed functional tests that also sufficiently monitor changes in muscle function; however, they strongly depend on patient collaboration. Quantitative MRI is an objective and sensitive biomarker to detect subclinical changes, though the examination costs may be a reason for its limited use. In this study, a high correlation between all clinical assessments and quantitative MRI scans was found. The combinational use of these methods provides a better understanding about disease progression; however, longitudinal studies are needed to validate their reliability.",,,,2019-01-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Speckle-tracking echocardiographic (STE) imaging is emerging as a noninvasive functional biomarker to consider in the early detection of DMD-related cardiomyopathy. However, STE analysis has not been assessed in a prospectively controlled study, especially in presymptomatic children with DMD, and no study has used STE analysis in all three displacements (longitudinal, radial, and circumferential) and for both ventricles.
This prospective controlled study enrolled 108 boys, 36 of whom had DMD (mean age, 11 ± 3.8 years) and 72 of whom were age-matched control subjects in a 1:2 case-control design. Conventional echocardiographic variables were collected for the left and right ventricles. STE analyses were performed in the longitudinal, radial, and circumferential displacements for the left ventricle and in the free wall longitudinal displacement for the right ventricle. The effect of age on the evolution of two-dimensional strain in children with DMD was studied by adding an interaction term, DMD × age, in the models.
Conventional echocardiographic measures were normal in both groups. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ranged from 45% to 76% (mean, 63 ± 6%) in the DMD group and from 55% to 76% (mean, 64 ± 5%) in the control group. Global LV strain mean measures were significantly worse in the DMD group for the longitudinal (-16.8 ± 3.9% vs -20.6 ± 2.6%, P < .0001), radial (22.7 ± 11.3% vs 31.7 ± 14%, P = .002), and circumferential (-16.5 ± 3.8% vs -20.3 ± 3.1%, P < .0001) displacements. The decrease of global LV longitudinal strain with age in children with DMD was 0.34% per year more marked than that in control subjects.

Previous clinical trials of this agent revealed lower exposure in DMD patients compared with healthy volunteers, which may reflect differences in diet. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of ezutromid in patients with DMD who followed a balanced diet. This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single and multiple oral dose study. Twelve pediatric patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatment sequences within which were 3 treatment periods of 2 weeks each. Each patient received, in a dose-escalating fashion, 1250 mg and 2500 mg twice daily (BID) of ezutromid administered orally as a microfluidized suspension (F3) with placebo in the other treatment period. Throughout the study, patients followed a balanced diet including recommended proportions of major food groups and administration of drug accompanied with 100 mL of full-fat milk. This approach improved the absorption of ezutromid, resulting in higher systemic exposure, with considerable variability in exposure between patients at each dose level. Single and multiple oral doses of 1250 mg and 2500 mg BID were considered safe and well tolerated. No severe or serious adverse events and no study discontinuations due to adverse events were reported.

Currently, several therapeutic approaches to cure DMD are being investigated, which can be categorized into two groups: therapies that aim to restore dystrophin expression, and those that aim to compensate for the lack of dystrophin. Therapies that restore dystrophin expression include read-through therapy, exon skipping, vector-mediated gene therapy, and cell therapy. Of these approaches, the most advanced are the read-through and exon skipping therapies. In 2014, ataluren, a drug that can promote ribosomal read-through of mRNA containing a premature stop codon, was conditionally approved in Europe. In 2016, eteplirsen, a morpholino-based chemical capable of skipping exon 51 in premature mRNA, received conditional approval in the USA. Clinical trials on vector-mediated gene therapy carrying micro- and mini- dystrophin are underway.

Dystrophin deficiency alters the structural integrity of the contractile apparatus/sarcolemmal integrity, leading to dystrophic changes. Dystrophin deficiency results in an increase in oxidative stress. We aimed to investigate the thiol/disulfide balance as an oxidative stress marker in children with DMD. We included 24 DMD, and 22 healthy control group subjects in the study. The total thiol, native thiol, and disulphide levels were measured and the disulphide/native thiol, disulphide/total thiol and native thiol/total thiol ratios were calculated in DMD patients and healthy subjects. The mean age distribution of the patients and the healthy control group subjects was similar. The total thiol, native thiol, and disulfide levels were lower in DMD group than the healthy controls. In conclusion, the markers and ratios were measured and calculated in the blood, and we detected that the total thiol, and native thiol levels were lower in DMD group than the healthy controls.

Empirical deployment of cardioactive medications has already improved outcomes, but the evidence base for clinical decision making is weak. Fundamental questions remain as to whether prophylactic therapy is justified and convincingly superior to prompt deployment of the same therapies once left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is detected. Even if it were, at what age should therapy be introduced and with what specific drugs?
We are conducting a multicentre, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled study of combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and a beta-blocker (bisoprolol) in boys with DMD aged 5-13 years, with normal LV function by echocardiographic criteria at the time of recruitment. Boys are being followed-up for a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5 years and undergo repeat assessments of LV function, heart rate and ECG, forced expiratory volume in the 1 s and forced vital capacity, adverse event reporting and quality of life at 6 monthly intervals.The primary outcome is change in LV function between active and placebo-treated participants over the course of the study.
The study was approved by 'NRES Committee East Midlands - Derby'. The results will be disseminated through manuscript publications, an international workshop and presentations to scientific meetings and parent forums.

Effective treatments for DMD through clinical trials and natural history studies are currently underway. Clinical trials in DMD typically include several outcome measures of motor function. Research sites and studies have been found to have slightly different operational definitions for a given functional outcome resulting in different procedures and protocols for these measurements.
The goal of this study is to establish agreement among experts in the field around best practices in collecting functional outcome data in DMD providing researchers and clinicians with guidance on best practices.
A group of 30 experts in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) with experience in the development and/ or execution of lower extremity outcome measures for this population met face to face to identify incongruences in the collection of this data. This effort was based in the United States (US) and sponsored by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy. Several discrepancies were categorized for each outcome which included: 6-minute walk test, 10-meter walk/run, supine to stand, ascend 4 stairs, sit to stand, and the NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment. Following this meeting an additional 32 experts in DMD (28 from the United States and 11 international participants) consented to participate in a Delphi Survey to reach consensus on the protocols and execution of lower extremity outcomes.
Round one: 70 operationally defined questions were surveyed with 45 (64%) reaching >70% consensus. Round two: 27 questions were operational, with 20 (74%) reaching >70% consensus. Those questions that did not reach consensus appear minor.
With minor modifications in the collection of data across sites, outcomes could potentially be normalized across research studies. This would reduce excessive training for evaluators in trials and produce minimal differences between protocols. Consistency in protocols will promote more efficient study start up, less errors between administration of items across studies, and ultimately improve quality and reliability of the functional outcomes.

30556126,A new era in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Developmental medicine and child neurology,"The management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has changed considerably over the last few decades. Standards of care have recently been updated, based on systematic reviews of the literature and structured, case-based consensus discussions of experts. Besides addressing muscular function, these recommendations cover most areas of organ involvement and psychosocial issues. Studies employing animal models investigating basic disease mechanisms have increased considerably. Development of valid functional outcome measures enabled high-evidence, clinical trials in males with DMD. Stop codon readthrough with ataluren has revealed some effect in patients with moderate disability and has been approved for males with suitable mutations who are still ambulant. Exon 51 skipping with eteplirsen demonstrated a structural and functional effect in a small group of patients and received restricted approval in the USA. Further trials investigating a broad range of mechanisms are underway. However, much more work is needed to develop more active treatments that stop disease progression. Likewise, the distribution of complex and expensive therapies to underprivileged patients and those in poorer regions must be improved. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Updated standards of care covering most clinical aspects of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are available. Adequately controlled clinical trials have allowed initial approval of disease-modifying drugs for small groups of patients.

we describe three Italian children with nmDMD treated with ataluren for 1 year. Measurements were made every 3 months and was evaluated the 6-Minute Walking Distance (6MWD).
Case1 involves a patient with a 6MWD at T0 of 360 m, who started ataluren therapy at age 10 years. Case2 is a child who began treatment with ataluren at age 8 years when he had severe ambulatory compromise (6MWD < 75 m at T0). A third patient (case3) had a 6MWD of 320 m when he started ataluren therapy at age 5 years. The best improvement in 6MWD was observed in case3, a patient in whom treatment with ataluren was started much earlier. In case1, ataluren was started relatively late and 6MWD was maintained at a stable level. Surprisingly, we observed a 50% improvement in 6MWD in case2, a patient who began therapy early, but with a severe loss of lower limb muscle function at the time.
treatment responses depend on the patient's age and disease severity when therapy was initiated. On the basis of our experience, the main factor that influences the effectiveness seems to be earlier instigation of therapy and positive results may still be achieved in patients with more severe muscle involvement.

Patients with DMD reveal progressive muscle weakness leading to ambulatory dysfunction. Novel outcome measures are needed for more sensitive evaluation of therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Multiple parameters of acceleration and angular velocity are used as efficient indicators to quantify the motion of subjects, and these parameters have been recently applied for evaluation of motor function in DMD. In the present study, we evaluated gait in a dystrophic dog model, CXMDJ, by measuring three-axial acceleration and angular velocity over the course of months. Hybrid sensors were placed on the dorsal thoracic and lumbar regions of dogs to detect a wide range of acceleration (±8 G) and angular velocity (±1000 degrees per second). Multiple parameters showed lower values in dystrophic dogs compared to wild-type (WT) dogs, and declined over the course of months. Acceleration magnitude (AM) at the thoracic region in dystrophic dogs was prominently lower compared with WT dogs, even at the age of 2 months, the onset of muscle weakness, whereas AM at the lumbar region drastically declined throughout the disease course. The angular velocity index in the vertical direction in the lumbar region increased in dystrophic dogs, suggesting waddling at the girdle. These parameters also accordingly decreased with exacerbation of clinical manifestations and a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity. The AM of dystrophic dogs was analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging to look for a correlation with crus muscle involvement.

The diagnosis of osteoporosis has shifted in recent years away from a bone mineral density-centric to a fracture-focused approach, with particular emphasis on early vertebral fracture identification (one of the key triggers for osteoporosis intervention). Delayed puberty should be addressed in an age-appropriate manner, with numerous options available for sex steroid replacement. Growth impairment, however, is a more challenging complication of glucocorticoid-treated DMD, one that is most likely best addressed through growth-sparing therapies that target the dystrophinopathy.

This was a 1-week, open-label, multiple-dose study with 3 sequential ascending doses (33, 67 and 100 mg/kg/day) of edasalonexent administered under different dietary conditions to 17 males with a mean age of 5.5 years.
All doses of edasalonexent were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, no drug discontinuations and no dose reductions. The majority of adverse events were mild, and the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (primarily diarrhea). Edasalonexent was rapidly absorbed with peak levels observed 2-6 hours after dosing and exposures appeared to increase nearly proportionally to dose for the 2 lower and all 3 doses under low-fat and high-fat meal conditions, respectively.

The objective of this study was to describe in detail the injection site reactions in these children treated with drisapersen (PRO-051), a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA antisense oligonucleotide, that induces exon 51 skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Antisense oligonucleotides, restoring the reading frame by skipping of exons, have become a potential treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other monogenetic diseases. Erythema followed by hyperpigmentation, fibrosis, and calcification were seen at the injection sites in all children. Ulcerations, which were difficult to heal, occurred in 5 of 7 children. Progression still occurred after switching to intravenous administration of drisapersen or even after stopping therapy. Systemic reactions included a reversible proteinuria and α1-microglobulinuria. Moreover, hypotrichosis was a common feature.Conclusion: Subcutaneous administration of drisapersen causes severe and progressive injection site effects. What is known: • Antisense oligonucleotides offer the possibility to convert Duchenne muscular dystrophy to the less severe Becker type. This can potentially be achieved by targeting and skipping specific exons of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene to restore the disrupted reading frame and to induce the production of a semi functional dystrophin protein. • Drisapersen is such an antisense oligonucleotides which can be administered subcutaneously. Its use has been tested extensively in the escalating dose pilot study (PRO051-02). What is new: • This report describes the injection site reactions caused by this type of agent in detail which has never been done before. We therefore reviewed the hospital files of 7 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy participating in the phase I/II open-label, escalating dose pilot study (PRO051-02) with drisapersen. • Severe side effects starting with erythema, hyperpigmentation, and later fibrosis, calcification, and difficult to treat ulcerations developed in all patients, and these continued to progress even after cessation of drisapersen. We discuss some possible underlying mechanisms. The exact mechanism however is still not known.",,,,2018-11-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

30420291,Evidence of muscle loss delay and improvement of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in Duchenne muscular dystrophy supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids: A randomized study.,"DHA, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, EPA, Hyperinsulinemia, Lean mass, Obesity","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most prevalent dystrophy of childhood and is characterized by generalized motor delays due to progressive muscular weakness, leading to loss of muscle mass. Additionally, patients with DMD develop obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and Insulin Resistance (IR). Omega-3 Long-Chain PolyUnsaturated Fatty Acids (Ω-3LCPUFA) increase fat mass, decrease lean mass, and decrease hyperinsulinemia and IR. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of Ω-3LCPUFA consumption on lean mass, fat mass, hyperinsulinemia, and IR in children with DMD.
This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study was carried out in 28 patients with DMD supplemented with 2.9 g/d of Ω-3LCPUFA (n = 14) or sunflower oil (placebo, n = 14) during 6 months. Serum glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and thereafter at months 3 and 6 of the intervention to estimate IR by HOmeostasis Model Assessment. Body composition was assessed by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry.
The percentage of change in EicosaPentaenoic Acid (EPA) and DocosaHexaenoic Acid (DHA) in erythrocytes was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in boys who consumed Ω-3LCPUFA than in the placebo group. Lean mass and fat mass (both in g/kg of Body Weight [BW]) had a trend toward being higher (p = 0.07 at month 3 and p = 0.085 at month 6) and lower (p = 0.05 at month 3 and p = 0.085 at month 6) respectively, in boys with DMD supplemented with Ω-3LCPUFA compared with the placebo group. The loss of lean mass was delayed in the Ω-3LCPUFA group; it started at month 6 but, in placebo, it started at month 3 of supplementation in comparison with the baseline of each group. Fasting insulin, percentage of boys with hyperinsulinemia, and IR were similar between the placebo and Ω-3LCPUFA groups during the 6 months of supplementation. The percentage of boys with IR was significantly (p = 0.045) lower at month 6 of supplementation in the Ω-3LCPUFA group than in the placebo group.
This study suggests that Ω-3LCPUFA (2.9 g/day) intake during 6 months likely slows the progression of muscle loss, decreases the fat mass, and reduces IR in boys with DMD. The findings of this study provide scientific background for conducting a randomized trial focused of confirming the possible beneficial role of Ω-3LCPUFA on the previously mentioned alterations mentioned in boys with early muscle damage (without fibrosis) DMD.

Stop codon read-through therapy is available with the drug Ataluren (Translarna® by PTC Therapeutics). Following positive results in ambulatory nmDMD (non-sense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy) patients, Ataluren received conditional approval in ambulant nmDMD patients by the EMA in 2014. However, there are limited data on non-ambulatory nmDMD patients treated with Ataluren. Here, we report our experience in four non-ambulatory nmDMD patients. Routine investigations included cardiac function, pulmonary function tests and muscle strength. We compared changes in left ventricular fractional shorting, forced volume vital capacity and BMI from two defined time periods (18-26-month period prior to and after Ataluren start). Mean age at loss of ambulation was 10.1 ± 0.5 years, mean age when initiating Ataluren treatment 14.1 ± 1.4 years. Serial echocardiography, pulmonary lung function tests, and assessment of muscle strength indicated mild attenuation of disease progression after initiation of Ataluren treatment. A possible side effect of Ataluren was a reduction in BMI. There were no adverse clinical effects or relevant abnormalities in routine laboratory values. We conclude that Ataluren appears to mildly ameliorate the clinical course in our patients with a good safety profile. However, larger clinical trials are required to assess the role of Ataluren and its long-term impact on disease progression in non-ambulant nmDMD patients.",,,,2018-11-09,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Nucleic acids,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a fatal muscle disease, caused by mutations in DMD, leading to loss of dystrophin expression. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotides (PMO-SSOs) have been used to elicit the restoration of a partially functional truncated dystrophin by excluding disruptive exons from the DMD messenger. The 30-mer PMO eteplirsen (EXONDYS51) developed for exon 51 skipping is the first dystrophin-restoring, conditionally FDA-approved drug in history. Clinical trials had shown a dose-dependent variable and patchy dystrophin restoration. The main obstacle for efficient dystrophin restoration is the inadequate uptake of PMOs into skeletal muscle fibers at low doses. The excessive cost of longer PMOs has limited the utilization of higher dosing. We designed shorter 25-mer PMOs directed to the same eteplirsen-targeted region of exon 51 and compared their efficacies in vitro and in vivo in the mdx52 murine model. Our results showed that skipped-dystrophin induction was comparable between the 30-mer PMO sequence of eteplirsen and one of the shorter PMOs, while the other 25-mer PMOs showed lower exon-skipping efficacies. Shorter PMOs would make higher doses economically feasible, and high dosing would result in better drug uptake into muscle, induce higher levels of dystrophin restoration in DMD muscle, and, ultimately, increase the clinical efficacy.",,,,2018-11-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

EIM offers the possibility to replace conventional physical functioning scores or quality of life measures, which depend on patient cooperation and mood.
Here, we propose a functional mixed-effects model using a state-space approach to describe the response trajectories of EIM data measured on 16 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 12 healthy controls, both groups measured over a period of two years. The modeling framework presented imposes a smoothing spline structure on EIM data collected at each visit and taking into account of within subject correlations of these curves along the longitudinal measurements. The modeling framework is recast in a state-space approach, thereby allowing for the employment of computationally efficient diffuse Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms for the model estimation, as well as the estimates of the posterior variance-covariance matrix for the construction of the Bayesian [Formula: see text] confidence bands.
The proposed model allows us to simultaneously adjust for baseline variables, differentiate the longitudinal changes in the smooth functional response and estimate the subject and subject-time specific deviations from the population-averaged response curves. The code is made publicly available in the supplementary material.

In complex organs such as the brain, gene regulation is of the utmost importance; aberrations in the regulation of specific genes can lead to neurological disorders. Understanding these mechanisms can create new strategies for targeting these disorders and progress is being made. Two drugs that function at the RNA level (nusinersen and eteplirsen) have now been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Spinomuscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, respectively; several other compounds for neurological disease are currently being investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Areas covered: We highlight how gene regulation at the level of RNA molecules can be used as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders. We provide examples of how such an approach is being studied or used and discuss the current hurdles. Expert opinion: Targeting gene expression at the RNA level is a promising strategy to treat genetic neurological disorders.

An altered taurine metabolism has been described in dystrophic animals and short-term taurine administration exerts promising amelioration of early muscular alterations in the mdx mouse model of DMD. To reinforce the therapeutic and nutraceutical taurine potential in DMD, we evaluated the effects of a long-term treatment on cardiac and skeletal muscle function of mdx mice in a later disease stage. Taurine was administered in drinking water (1 g/kg/day) to wt and mdx mice for 6 months, starting at 6 months of age. Ultrasonography evaluation of heart and hind limb was performed, in parallel with in vivo and ex vivo functional tests and biochemical, histological and gene expression analyses. 12-month-old mdx mice showed a significant worsening of left ventricular function parameters (shortening fraction, ejection fraction, stroke volume), which were significantly counteracted by the taurine treatment. In parallel, histologic signs of damage were reduced by taurine along with the expression of proinflammatory myocardial IL-6. Interestingly, no effects were observed on hind limb volume and percentage of vascularization or on in vivo and ex vivo muscle functional parameters, suggesting a tissue-specific action of taurine in relation to the disease phase. A trend toward increase in taurine was found in heart and quadriceps from treated animals, paralleled by a slight decrease in mdx mice plasma.

30326162,Interventions for preventing and treating cardiac complications in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"The dystrophinopathies include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDCM). In recent years, co-ordinated multidisciplinary management for these diseases has improved the quality of care, with early corticosteroid use prolonging independent ambulation, and the routine use of non-invasive ventilation signficantly increasing survival. The next target to improve outcomes is optimising treatments to delay the onset or slow the progression of cardiac involvement and so prolong survival further.
To assess the effects of interventions for preventing or treating cardiac involvement in DMD, BMD, and XLDCM, using measures of change in cardiac function over six months.
On 16 October 2017 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, and on 12 December 2017, we searched two clinical trials registries. We also searched conference proceedings and bibliographies.
We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and randomised cross-over trials for inclusion. In the Discussion, we reviewed open studies, longitudinal observational studies and individual case reports but only discussed studies that adequately described the diagnosis, intervention, pretreatment, and post-treatment states and in which follow-up lasted for at least six months.
Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified from the search and performed data extraction. All three authors assessed risk of bias independently, compared results, and decided which trials met the inclusion criteria. They assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE criteria.
We included five studies (N = 205) in the review; four studies included participants with DMD only, and one study included participants with DMD or BMD. All studied different interventions, and meta-analysis was not possible. We found no studies for XLDCM. None of the trials reported cardiac function as improved or stable cardiac versus deteriorated.The randomised first part of a two-part study of perindopril (N = 28) versus placebo (N = 27) in boys with DMD with normal heart function at baseline showed no difference in the number of participants with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) of less than 45% after three years of therapy (n = 1 in each group; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 15.77). This result is uncertain because of study limitations, indirectness and imprecision. In a non-randomised follow-up study, after 10 years, more participants who had received placebo from the beginning had reduced LVEF% (less than 45%). Adverse event rates were similar between the placebo and treatment groups (low-certainty evidence).A study comparing treatment with lisinopril versus losartan in 23 boys newly diagnosed with Duchenne cardiomyopathy showed that after 12 months, both were equally effective in preserving or improving LVEF% (lisinopril 54.6% (standard deviation (SD) 5.19), losartan 55.2% (SD 7.19); mean difference (MD) -0.60% CI -6.67 to 5.47: N = 16). The certainty of evidence was very low because of very serious imprecision and study limitations (risk of bias). Two participants in the losartan group were withdrawn due to adverse events: one participant developed an allergic reaction, and a second exceeded the safety standard with a fall in ejection fraction greater than 10%. Authors reported no other adverse events related to the medication (N = 22; very low-certainty evidence).A study comparing idebenone versus placebo in 21 boys with DMD showed little or no difference in mean change in cardiac function between the two groups from baseline to 12 months; for fractional shortening the mean change was 1.4% (SD 4.1) in the idebenone group and 1.6% (SD 2.6) in the placebo group (MD -0.20%, 95% CI -3.07 to 2.67, N = 21), and for ejection fraction the mean change was -1.9% (SD 9.8) in the idebenone group and 0.4% (SD 5.5) in the placebo group (MD -2.30%, 95% CI -9.18 to 4.58, N = 21). The certainty of evidence was very low because of study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reported adverse events were similar between the treatment and placebo groups (low-certainty evidence).A multicentre controlled study added eplerenone or placebo to 42 patients with DMD with early cardiomyopathy but preserved left ventricular function already established on ACEI or ARB therapy. Results showed that eplerenone slowed the rate of decline of magnetic resonance (MR)-assessed left ventricular circumferential strain at 12 months (eplerenone group median 1.0%, interquartile range (IQR) 0.3 to -2.2; placebo group median 2.2%, IQR 1.3 to -3.1%; P = 0.020). The median decline in LVEF over the same period was also less in the eplerenone group (-1.8%, IQR -2.9 to 6.0) than in the placebo group (-3.7%, IQR -10.8 to 1.0; P = 0.032). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to very low for study limitations and serious imprecision. Serious adverse events were reported in two patients given placebo but none in the treatment group (very low-certainty evidence).A randomised placebo-controlled study of subcutaneous growth hormone in 16 participants with DMD or BMD showed an increase in left ventricular mass after three months' treatment but no significant improvement in cardiac function. The evidence was of very low certainty due to imprecision, indirectness, and study limitations. There were no clinically significant adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).Some studies were at risk of bias, and all were small. Therefore, although there is some evidence from non-randomised data to support the prophylactic use of perindopril for cardioprotection ahead of detectable cardiomyopathy, and for lisinopril or losartan plus eplerenone once cardiomyopathy is detectable, this must be considered of very low certainty. Findings from non-randomised studies, some of which have been long term, have led to the use of these drugs in daily clinical practice.
Based on the available evidence from RCTs, early treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be comparably beneficial for people with a dystrophinopathy; however, the certainty of evidence is very low. Very low-certainty evidence indicates that adding eplerenone might give additional benefit when early cardiomyopathy is detected. No clinically meaningful effect was seen for growth hormone or idebenone, although the certainty of the evidence is also very low.",,,,2018-10-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

They are historically divided into the more severe Duchenne (DMD) and milder Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophy phenotypes. Classification is important for research and clinical care. The purpose of this study was to describe a multi-variable approach to classifying cases from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) and to assess the accuracy of the diagnostic classification scheme. We used age at loss of mobility, molecular testing results, and age at symptom onset to classify cases as having DMD or BMD and to assess sensitivity and specificity. Mobility status showed low sensitivity and high specificity for predicting DMD (65.5% and 99.3%, respectively) and BMD (62.8% and 97.7%, respectively) phenotypes. Molecular testing showed 90.9% sensitivity and 66.4% specificity for DMD; 76.3% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity for BMD. Age of onset predicted DMD with sensitivity of 73.9% and specificity of 69.0%; BMD had 99.7% specificity and 36.7% sensitivity. Mobility status, molecular test results, and age at symptom onset are important but inconsistent measures for accurately classifying individuals into DMD or BMD phenotypes. These results have implications for prognosis in newly diagnosed individuals and for classifying phenotype in clinical trials.",,,,2018-10-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Currently, the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) are the primary outcome measures in clinical trials, but they are severely limited by the subjective consciousness and mood of patients, and can only be used in older and ambulatory boys. This study proposed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate the dynamic changes in muscle hemodynamic responses (gastrocnemius and forearm muscle) during a 6-MWT and a venous occlusion test (VOT), respectively. Muscle oxygenation of the forearm was evaluated non-invasively before, during and after VOT in all participants (included 30 DMD patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls), while dynamic muscle oxygenation of gastrocnemius muscle during 6-MWT was determined in ambulatory participants (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 30). The results reveal that impaired muscle oxygenation was observed during 6-MWT in DMD patients that may explain why the DMD patients walked shorter distances than healthy controls. Moreover, the results of VOT implied that worsening muscle function was associated with a lower supply of muscle oxygenation and may provide useful information on the relationship between muscular oxygen consumption and supply for the clinical diagnosis of DMD. Therefore, the method of fNIRS with VOT possesses great potential in future evaluations of DMD patients that implies a good feasibility for clinical application such as for monitoring disease severity of DMD.",,,,2018-10-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Synthetic block copolymers have a rich history and wide array of applications from industry to biology. Potential for discovery is enabled by a large chemical space for block copolymers, including modifications in block copolymer mass, composition, and molecular architecture. Collectively, this presents an impressive chemical landscape to leverage distinct structure-function outcomes. Of particular relevance to biology and medicine, stabilization of damaged phospholipid membranes using amphiphilic block copolymers, classified as poloxamers or pluronics, has been the subject of increasing scientific inquiry. This review focuses on implementing block copolymers to protect fragile muscle membranes against mechanical stress. The review highlights interventions in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal disease of progressive muscle deterioration owing to marked instability of the striated muscle membrane. Biophysical and chemical engineering advances are presented that delineate and expand upon current understanding of copolymer-lipid membrane interactions and the mechanism of stabilization. The studies presented here serve to underscore the utility of copolymer discovery leading toward the therapeutic application of block copolymers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and potentially other biomedical applications in which membrane integrity is compromised.",,,,2018-10-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
30304405,Embryonic myosin is a regeneration marker to monitor utrophin-based therapies for DMD.,,Human molecular genetics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, X-linked muscle-wasting disease caused by lack of the cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. Constitutive utrophin expression, a structural and functional paralogue of dystrophin, can successfully prevent the dystrophic pathology in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse model. In dystrophic muscles, utrophin is increased as part of the repair process and localized at the sarcolemma of regenerating myofibers. The presence of developmental myosin such as embryonic myosin (MyHC-emb) and neonatal represents a useful marker of muscle regeneration and a meaningful indicator of muscle damage, which correlates with the clinical severity of milder Becker muscular dystrophy and DMD patients. In the present study, we demonstrate that MyHC-emb is a robust marker of regeneration at different ages and in different skeletal muscles. We also evaluate the correlation between utrophin, dystrophin and MyHC-emb in wild-type (wt) and regenerating dystrophic muscles. Restoration of dystrophin significantly reduced MyHC-emb levels. Similarly, overexpression of utrophin in the transgenic mdx-Fiona mice reduced the number of MyHC-emb positive fibers to wt level, prevented the regenerative process and rescued the muscle function. In contrast, the absence of utrophin in the dystrophin-deficient double-knockout mice resulted in a higher MyHC-emb content and in a more severe dystrophic pathophysiology than in mdx mice.

In addition to its ability to improve the control of hyperglycaemia, metformin has been shown to reduce the burden o,f ageing via effects on damaged DNA and the process of apoptosis. Studies have shown that metformin may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through influences on body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and the progression of atherosclerosis. Studies also suggest that metformin may be beneficial for neuro-psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment and in reducing the risk of dementia, erectile dysfunction and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that metformin has anti-cancer properties, and population studies have suggested that metformin may reduce the risk of cancer or improve cancer prognosis. It is thought that it exerts its anti-cancer effect through the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. Because of its effect on the mTOR pathway, there may be a role for metformin in slowing or reversing growth of life-threatening hamartomas in tuberous sclerosis complex.",,,,2018-10-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Standard of care guidelines recommend regular assessment of pulmonary function by hospital-based spirometry to detect onset and monitor progression of pulmonary function decline.
To assess the feasibility of home-based monitoring of pulmonary function by a hand-held device (HHD) in adolescent and adult patients with DMD over a period of 12 months.
In the phase III randomized placebo-controlled DELOS trial in 10-18 year old DMD patients, peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements were collected weekly at home by the patient (assisted by parent/caregiver) using a peak flow meter HHD. Adherence to the use of the HHD was assessed and 12-month changes in PEF as percent of predicted (PEF% p) for the idebenone (N = 31) and the placebo treatment groups (N = 33) from HHD-derived data were compared to results from hospital-based spirometry.
A total of 2689 individual HHD assessments were analysed. Overall adherence to the use of the HHD over the course of the 12-month study duration was good (75.9%, SD 21.5%) and PEF% p data obtained at the same day by HHD and standard spirometry correlated well (Spearman's rho 0.80; p < 0.001). Several analysis methods of HHD-derived data for PEF% p consistently demonstrate that idebenone treatment slowed the decline in PEF% p compared to placebo, which supports the statistically significant difference in favour of idebenone for PEF% p measured by standard spirometry.

30278058,A multicenter comparison of quantification methods for antisense oligonucleotide-induced DMD exon 51 skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy cell cultures.,,PloS one,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal disease caused by lack of dystrophin. Skipping of exons adjacent to out-of-frame deletions has proven to restore dystrophin expression in Duchenne patients. Exon 51 has been the most studied target in both preclinical and clinical settings and the availability of standardized procedures to quantify exon skipping would be advantageous for the evaluation of preclinical and clinical data.
To compare methods currently used to quantify antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon 51 skipping in the DMD transcript and to provide guidance about the method to use.
Six laboratories shared blinded RNA samples from Duchenne patient-derived muscle cells treated with different amounts of exon 51 targeting antisense oligonucleotide. Exon 51 skipping levels were quantified using five different techniques: digital droplet PCR, single PCR assessed with Agilent bioanalyzer, nested PCR with agarose gel image analysis by either ImageJ or GeneTools software and quantitative real-time PCR.
Differences in mean exon skipping levels and dispersion around the mean were observed across the different techniques. Results obtained by digital droplet PCR were reproducible and showed the smallest dispersion. Exon skipping quantification with the other methods showed overestimation of exon skipping or high data variation.
Our results suggest that digital droplet PCR was the most precise and quantitative method. The quantification of exon 51 skipping by Agilent bioanalyzer after a single round of PCR was the second-best choice with a 2.3-fold overestimation of exon 51 skipping levels compared to digital droplet PCR.",,Differences in mean exon skipping levels and dispersion around the mean were observed across the different techniques.

30275247,Bone Health and Osteoporosis Management of the Patient With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,,Pediatrics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with an increased risk of bone fragility due to the adverse effects of prolonged glucocorticoid therapy and progressive muscle weakness on bone strength. Osteoporosis manifests clinically as low-trauma long-bone and vertebral fractures (VFs), with VFs frequent, particularly in those treated with glucocorticoid therapy. It is increasingly recognized that bone pain, medical complications of osteoporosis (such as fat embolism syndrome), and the potential for permanent, fracture-induced loss of ambulation can be mitigated with timely bone health surveillance and management. This includes periodic spine radiographs for VF detection because VFs can be asymptomatic in their early phases and thereby go undetected in the absence of monitoring. With this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the following 4 phases of bone health management: (1) bone health monitoring, which is used to identify early signs of compromised bone health; (2) osteoporosis stabilization, which is aimed to mitigate back pain and interrupt the fracture-refracture cycle through bone-targeted therapy; (3) bone health maintenance, which has the goal to preserve the clinical gains realized during the stabilization phase through ongoing bone-targeted therapy; and (4) osteoporosis therapy discontinuation, which places those who are eligible for discontinuation of osteoporosis treatment back on a health monitoring program. In the course of reviewing these 4 phases of management, we will discuss the criteria for diagnosing osteoporosis, along with detailed recommendations for osteoporosis intervention including specific drugs, dose, length of therapy, contraindications, and monitoring of treatment efficacy and safety.",,,,2018-10-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Depending on the type of mutation, patients develop either the severe DMD or the milder Becker Muscular Dystrophy. Although substantial effort was made, the pathophysiology and variation in disease severity are still poorly understood. During the last two decades, relentless efforts were made to develop therapeutic strategies. Among these, gene therapy and cell replacement therapy appear very promising. These approaches are based on the replacement and/or repair of the mutated DMD gene or transcript at the molecular level, or at the cellular level via replacement of the damaged muscle cells. While highly successful in animal models, these therapies showed only modest efficacy in human clinical trials. More importantly, variable effects were observed in patients carrying the same mutation, suggesting that several factors (e.g., genetic modifiers, environmental factors) can affect treatment outcomes.

This 2-week, open-label Phase IIa multiple ascending dose study (0.25, 0.75, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day) enrolled 48 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (4 to <7 years), with outcomes including clinical safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The study design included pharmacodynamic biomarkers in three contexts of use: 1. Secondary outcomes for pharmacodynamic safety (insulin resistance, adrenal suppression, bone turnover); 2. Exploratory outcomes for drug mechanism of action; 3. Exploratory outcomes for expanded pharmacodynamic safety. Vamorolone was safe and well-tolerated through the highest dose tested (6.0 mg/kg/day) and pharmacokinetics of vamorolone were similar to prednisolone. Using pharmacodynamic biomarkers, the study demonstrated improved safety of vamorolone versus glucocorticoids as shown by reduction of insulin resistance, beneficial changes in bone turnover (loss of increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation only at the highest dose level), and a reduction in adrenal suppression. Exploratory biomarkers of pharmacodynamic efficacy showed an anti-inflammatory mechanism of action and a beneficial effect on plasma membrane stability, as demonstrated by a dose-responsive decrease in serum creatine kinase activity. With an array of pre-selected biomarkers in multiple contexts of use, we demonstrate the development of the first dissociative steroid that preserves anti-inflammatory efficacy and decreases steroid-associated safety concerns.

The strategies used to redirect splicing for therapeutic purpose involve the use of AONs complementary to splice motifs, enhancer or silencer sequences. AONs to block intronic splicing silencer motifs can efficiently augment exon 7 inclusion in survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene and have demonstrated robust therapeutic effects in both preclinical studies and clinical trials in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which has led to a recently approved drug. AONs with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) backbone have shown target engagement with restoration of the defective protein in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and their safety profile lead to a recent conditional approval for one DMD PMO drug.

This approach uses antisense oligonucleotides (AON) to modify the splicing of pre-mRNA to correct the mutation responsible for a disease, or to suppress a particular gene expression, as in allergic diseases. Antisense-mediated exon skipping is most extensively studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and has developed from in vitro proof-of-concept studies to clinical trials targeting various single exons such as exon 45 (casimersen), exon 53 (NS-065/NCNP-01, golodirsen), and exon 51 (eteplirsen). Eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), is the first approved antisense therapy for DMD in the USA, and provides a treatment option for ~14% of all DMD patients, who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Eteplirsen is granted accelerated approval and marketing authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on the condition that additional postapproval trials show clinical benefit. Permanent exon skipping achieved at the DNA level using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology holds promise in current preclinical trials for DMD. In hopes of achieving clinical success parallel to DMD, exon skipping and splice modulation are also being studied in other muscular dystrophies, such as Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), dysferlinopathy including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), and distal anterior compartment myopathy (DMAT), myotonic dystrophy, and merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A).

To establish an immunofluorescent scanning and digital image analysis workflow that provides an objective approach for staining intensity assessment of the immunofluorescence dystrophin labeling and determination of the percentage of biomarker-positive fibers in muscle cryosections.
Optimal and repeatable digital image capture was achieved by a rigorously qualified fluorescent scanning process. After scanning qualification, the MuscleMap (Flagship Biosciences, Westminster, Colorado) algorithm was validated by comparing high-power microscopic field total and dystrophin-positive fiber counts obtained by trained pathologists to data derived by MuscleMap. Next, the algorithm was tested on whole-slide images of immunofluorescent-labeled muscle sections from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and control patients.
When used under the guidance of a trained pathologist, the digital image analysis tool met predefined validation criteria and demonstrated functional and statistical equivalence with manual assessment. This work is the first, to our knowledge, to qualify and validate immunofluorescent scanning and digital tissue image-analysis workflow, respectively, with the rigor required to support the clinical trial environments.

Conceptually, replacing the mutated gene with a normal one would cure the disease. However, this task has encountered significant challenges due to the enormous size of the gene and the distribution of muscle throughout the body. The former creates a hurdle for viral vector packaging and the latter begs for whole-body therapy. To address these obstacles, investigators have invented the highly abbreviated micro-dystrophin gene and developed body-wide systemic gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV). Numerous microgene configurations and various AAV serotypes have been explored in animal models in many laboratories. Preclinical data suggests that intravascular AAV micro-dystrophin delivery can significantly ameliorate muscle pathology, enhance muscle force, and attenuate dystrophic cardiomyopathy in animals. Against this backdrop, several clinical trials have been initiated to test the safety and tolerability of this promising therapy in DMD patients.

We investigated two pharmacological options aimed to increase nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in 20 male BMD patients (age range 21-44 years): (1) supplementation with L-citrulline (3 × 5 g/d), the precursor of L-arginine which is the substrate of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS); and (2) treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin (3 × 500 mg/d) which activates nNOS in human skeletal muscle. We also investigated the combined use of L-citrulline (3 × 5 g/d) and metformin (3 × 500 mg/d). Before and after treatment, we measured in serum and urine samples the concentration of amino acids and metabolites of L-arginine-related pathways and the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA). Compared to healthy subjects, BMD patients have altered NOS, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) pathways. Metformin treatment resulted in concentration decrease of arginine and MDA in serum, and of homoarginine (hArg) and guanidinoacetate (GAA) in serum and urine. L-Citrulline supplementation resulted in considerable increase of the concentrations of amino acids and creatinine in the serum, and in their urinary excretion rates. Combined use of metformin and L-citrulline attenuated the effects obtained from their single administrations. Metformin, L-citrulline or their combination did not alter serum nitrite and nitrate concentrations and their urinary excretion rates. In conclusion, metformin or L-citrulline supplementation to BMD patients results in remarkable antidromic changes of the AGAT and GAMT pathways.

Ultimately, the unmet therapeutic needs of rare-disease patients can be met while protecting patient safety. This Note reasons that, if carefully implemented, the 21st Century Cures Act and the Trickett Wendler Right to Try Act could work in tandem to safely facilitate patient access to rare-disease treatments.",,,,2018-07-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
29991140,Virtual Reality Computer Gaming with Dynamic Arm Support in Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, dynamic arm support, exercise, neuromuscular diseases, training, upper limb",Journal of neuromuscular diseases,"In boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), loss of upper limb function becomes more evident after the onset of wheelchair-dependency, because of the inability to lift the arms against gravity. With an increasing population of older wheelchair-dependent boys with DMD it is worthwhile to know whether training can delay the loss of upper limb functions. Dynamic arm supports may enable boys with impaired arm function to train their muscles without becoming exhausted by providing external mechanical compensation for muscle weakness.
This study investigated the effect of gravity-compensated 3D-training for the arms on the functional abilities in boys with DMD.
An explorative RCT was conducted among boys with DMD with impaired arm function (n = 16). Boys in the intervention group (n = 7) trained their arms by playing virtual reality games while using dynamic arm support during 20 weeks. The primary endpoint was the difference in change in Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL) score between the intervention and control group (n = 9) after 20 weeks. Secondary outcome measures were at the different ICF-CY levels.
No significant group differences were found for the PUL. Elbow range of motion (p = 0.018) and extension strength (p = 0.038) improved in the intervention group and worsened in the control group.
Although this study did not show a significant effect of training on the primary outcome measure, there are indications that training may decline the loss of range of motion and strength. This may prolong the functional abilities on long-term.

29980148,"Secondary Bone Defect in Neuromuscular Diseases in Childhood: A Longitudinal ""Muscle-Bone Unit"" Analysis.",,Neuropediatrics,"To evaluate the potential bone defect in neuromuscular diseases, we conducted a longitudinal study including three groups of patients: 14 Duchenne muscular dystrophies (DMD) and 2 limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD); 3 Becker muscular dystrophies (BeMD) and 7 spinal muscular atrophies (SMA). Yearly osteodensitometries assessed body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) associated with bone markers and leptin. Along the 7-year study, 107 osteodensitometries showed that bone status evolved to osteopenia in most patients except BeMD. When analyzing the crude values, BMD improved with age in BeMD and SMA but not in DMD/LGMD. The correlation using the Z-scores displayed a decrease in BMD with age in DMD/LGMD for all regions, in SMA at total body less head, whereas BMD increased in BeMD at lumbar spine. As observed in healthy persons, muscular mass and bone tissue were significantly correlated. Glucocorticoids were deleterious on trabecular and cortical bone. Leptin was high in most patients and correlated to fat mass and bone parameters. This study confirms a secondary bone defect in neuromuscular diseases, further confirming the functional relationship between bone and muscle and arguing for regular bone follow-up in patients to prevent fracture risk.

29912990,Peptide-conjugated phosphodiamidate oligomer-mediated exon skipping has benefits for cardiac function in mdx and Cmah-/-mdx mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,PloS one,"Cardiac failure is a major cause of mortality in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Antisense-mediated exon skipping has the ability to correct out-of-frame mutations in DMD to produce truncated but functional dystrophin. Traditional antisense approaches have however been limited by their poor uptake into cardiac muscle. The addition of cell-penetrating peptides to antisense molecules has increased their potency and improved their uptake into all muscles, including the heart. We have investigated the efficacy of the Peptide-conjugated phosphodiamidate morpholino oligomer (P-PMO) Pip6a-PMO, for restoration of cardiac dystrophin and functional rescue in DMD mice- the mdx mouse and the less well characterised Cmah-/-mdx mouse (which carry a human-like mutation in the mouse Cmah gene as well as a mutation in DMD). In our first study male mdx mice were administered Pip6a-PMO, i.v, fortnightly from 12 to 30 weeks of age alongside mock-injected age-matched mdx and C57BL10 controls. Mice received 4 doses of 18 mg/kg followed by 8 doses of 12.5 mg/kg. The cardiac function of the mice was analysed 2 weeks after their final injection by MRI followed by conductance catheter and their muscles were harvested for dystrophin quantification. In the second study, male Cmah-/-mdx mice, received 12.5 mg/kg Pip6a-PMO, i.v fortnightly from 8 to 26 weeks and assessed by MRI at 3 time points (12, 18 and 28 weeks) alongside mock-injected age-matched mdx, C57BL10 and Cmah-/-mdx controls. The mice also underwent MEMRI and conductance catheter at 28 weeks. This allowed us to characterise the cardiac phenotype of Cmah-/-mdx mice as well as assess the effects of P-PMO on cardiac function. Pip6a-PMO treatment resulted in significant restoration of dystrophin in mdx and Cmah-/-mdx mice (37.5% and 51.6%, respectively), which was sufficient to significantly improve cardiac function, ameliorating both right and left ventricular dysfunction. Cmah-/-mdx mice showed an abnormal response to dobutamine stress test and this was completely ameliorated by PIP6a-PMO treatment. These encouraging data suggest that total restoration of dystrophin may not be required to significantly improve cardiac outcome in DMD patients and that it may be realistic to expect functional improvements with modest levels of dystrophin restoration which may be very achievable in future clinical trials.",,,,2018-06-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Eteplirsen received conditional approval in the United States in 2016. To date, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exon skipping drugs have been published to determine the pooled estimates for the effect of exon skipping in treating DMD.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind RCTs comparing exon-skipping drugs with placebo in DMD was performed. Trials were identified by searching published and unpublished studies from electronically available databases and clinical trial registries through October 2017. The primary outcomes were changes in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) scores, and adverse events. Random-effects meta-analysis and assessment of risk of bias were performed. This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42016037504).
Five studies involving 322 participants were included, investigating eteplirsen in one and drisapersen in four studies. There were no changes in 6MWT distance (mean difference [MD] - 9.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 21.94 to 3.62) or NSAA scores (MD 1.20, 95% CI - 2.35 to 4.75) after 24 weeks of treatment in the exon-skipping group compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis for a 6 mg/kg weekly injection of drisapersen showed significant changes in the 6MWT, favoring drisapersen after 24 weeks (MD - 20.24; 95% CI - 39.59 to - 0.89). However, drisapersen resulted in a significant increase in injection site reactions (risk ratio [RR] 3.67, 95% CI 1.96 to 6.89, p < 0.0001) and renal toxicity (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.94, p = 0.02). Risk of bias was high in two of the five studies, including the eteplirsen and one drisapersen study.
Current available data do not show evidence that exon-skipping drugs are effective in DMD. Despite potential effectiveness when used at a specific dose, significant side effects were reported with drisapersen. The small number of RCTs with relatively small numbers of participants indicate the difficulty in conducting sufficiently powered studies of DMD. Prospectively planned meta-analysis and utilization of the real-world data may provide a more precise estimate of the effect of exon skipping in this disease.",,"Five studies involving 322 participants were included, investigating eteplirsen in one and drisapersen in four studies.

Nucleic acids,"Antisense oligonucleotide (AON) therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy has drawn great attention in preclinical and clinical trials, but its therapeutic applications are still limited due to inefficient delivery. In this study, we investigated a few saponins for their potential to improve delivery performance of an antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that these saponins, especially digitonin and tomatine, improve the delivery efficiency of PMO comparable to Endo-Porter-mediated PMO delivery in vitro. The significant enhancement of PMO targeting to dystrophin exon 23 delivery was further observed in mdx mice up to 7-fold with the digitonin as compared to PMO alone. Cytotoxicity of the digitonin and glycyrrhizin was lower than Endo-Porter in vitro and not clearly detected in vivo under the tested concentrations. These results demonstrate that optimization of saponins in molecular size and composition are key factors to achieve enhanced PMO exon-skipping efficiency.

Over the past years, there have been initiatives to facilitate the process of international study set-up, but the fruits of these deliberations require time to be operationally in place. FOR-DMD (Finding the Optimum Steroid Regimen for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) is an academic-led clinical trial which aims to find the optimum steroid regimen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 5 years (July 2010 to June 2015), anticipating that all sites (40 across the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany and Italy) would be open to recruitment from July 2011. However, study start-up was significantly delayed and recruitment did not start until January 2013.
The FOR-DMD study is used as an example to identify systematic problems in the set-up of international, multi-centre clinical trials. The full timeline of the FOR-DMD study, from funding approval to site activation, was collated and reviewed. Systematic issues were identified and grouped into (1) study set-up, e.g. drug procurement; (2) country set-up, e.g. competent authority applications; and (3) site set-up, e.g. contracts, to identify the main causes of delay and suggest areas where anticipatory action could overcome these obstacles in future studies.
Time from the first contact to site activation across countries ranged from 6 to 24 months. Reasons of delay were universal (sponsor agreement, drug procurement, budgetary constraints), country specific (complexity and diversity of regulatory processes, indemnity requirements) and site specific (contracting and approvals). The main identified obstacles included (1) issues related to drug supply, (2) NIH requirements regarding contracting with non-US sites, (3) differing regulatory requirements in the five participating countries, (4) lack of national harmonisation with contracting and the requirement to negotiate terms and contract individually with each site and (5) diversity of languages needed for study materials. Additionally, as with many academic-led studies, the FOR-DMD study did not have access to the infrastructure and expertise that a contracted research organisation could provide, organisations often employed in pharmaceutical-sponsored studies. This delay impacted recruitment, challenged the clinical relevance of the study outcomes and potentially delayed the delivery of the best treatment to patients.
Based on the FOR-DMD experience, and as an interim solution, we have devised a checklist of steps to not only anticipate and minimise delays in academic international trial initiation but also identify obstacles that will require a concerted effort on the part of many stakeholders to mitigate.","The FOR-DMD study is used as an example to identify systematic problems in the set-up of international, multi-centre clinical trials.

The efforts of many laboratories brought new treatments of DMD to the reality, but ongoing and forthcoming clinical trials suffer from absence of valuable biomarkers permitting to follow the outcome of the treatment day by day and to adjust the treatment if needed. In the present study the levels of 128 urinary proteins including growth factors, cytokines and chemokines were compared in urine of DMD patients and age related control subjects by antibody array approach. Surprisingly, statistically significant difference was observed only for urinary ferritin whose level was 50 times higher in young DMD patients. To explain the observed high urinary ferritin content we analysed the levels of iron, iron containing proteins and proteins involved in regulation of iron metabolism in serum and urine of DMD patients and their age-matched healthy controls. Obtained data strongly suggest that elevated level of urinary ferritin is functionally linked to the renal management of myoglobin iron derived from leaky muscles of DMD patients. This first observation of the high level of ferritin in urine of DMD patients permits to consider this protein as a new urinary biomarker in muscular dystrophies and sheds light on the mechanisms of iron metabolism and kidney functioning in DMD.",,,,2018-05-20,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The term 'muscular dystrophy' refers to a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases associated with a primary muscle defect that leads to progressive muscle wasting and consequent loss of muscle function. Muscular dystrophies are accompanied by numerous clinical complications and abnormalities in other tissues that cause extreme discomfort in everyday life. The fact that muscular dystrophy often takes its toll on babies and small children, and that many patients die at a young age, adds to the cruel character of the disease. Clinicians all over the world are facing the same problem: they have no therapy to offer except for symptom-relieving interventions. Patients, their families, but also clinicians, are in urgent need of an effective cure. Despite advances in genetics, increased understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying muscle disease, despite a sweeping range of successful preclinical strategies and relative progress of their implementation in the clinic, therapy for patients is currently out of reach. Only a greater comprehension of disease mechanisms, new preclinical studies, development of novel technologies, and tight collaboration between scientists and physicians can help improve clinical treatment.

29579078,A novel high-throughput immunofluorescence analysis method for quantifying dystrophin intensity in entire transverse sections of Duchenne muscular dystrophy muscle biopsy samples.,,PloS one,"Clinical trials using strategies aimed at inducing dystrophin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are underway or at advanced planning stage, including splice switching antisense oligonucleotides (AON), drugs to induce read-through of nonsense mutations and viral mediated gene therapy. In all these strategies, different dystrophin proteins, often internally deleted, are produced, similar to those found in patients with the milder DMD allelic variant, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). The primary biological endpoint of these trials is to induce functional dystrophin expression. A reliable and reproducible method for quantification of dystrophin protein expression at the sarcolemma is crucial to monitor the biochemical outcome of such treatments. We developed a new high throughput semi quantitative fluorescent immunofluorescence method for quantifying dystrophin expression in transverse sections of skeletal muscle. This technique is completely operator independent as it based on an automated scanning system and an image processing script developed with Definiens software. We applied this new acquisition-analysis method to quantify dystrophin and sarcolemma-related proteins using paediatric control muscles from cases without a neuromuscular disorder as well as DMD and BMD samples. The image analysis script was instructed to recognize myofibres immunostained for spectrin or laminin while dystrophin was quantified in each identified myofibre (from 2,000 to over 20,000 fibres, depending on the size of the biopsy). We were able to simultaneously extrapolate relevant parameters such as mean sarcolemmal dystrophin, mean spectrin and laminin intensity, fibre area and diameter. In this way we assessed dystrophin production in each muscle fibre in samples of DMD, BMD and controls. This new method allows the unbiased quantification of dystrophin in every myofibre within a transverse muscle section and will be of help for translational research projects as a biological outcome in clinical trials in DMD and BMD.",,,,2018-03-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
29554116,Skeletal muscle magnetic resonance biomarkers correlate with function and sentinel events in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,PloS one,"To provide evidence for quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR) biomarkers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by investigating the relationship between qMR measures of lower extremity muscle pathology and functional endpoints in a large ambulatory cohort using a multicenter study design.
MR spectroscopy and quantitative imaging were implemented to measure intramuscular fat fraction and the transverse magnetization relaxation time constant (T2) in lower extremity muscles of 136 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measures were collected at 554 visits over 48 months at one of three imaging sites. Fat fraction was measured in the soleus and vastus lateralis using MR spectroscopy, while T2 was assessed using MRI in eight lower extremity muscles. Ambulatory function was measured using the 10m walk/run, climb four stairs, supine to stand, and six minute walk tests.
Significant correlations were found between all qMR and functional measures. Vastus lateralis qMR measures correlated most strongly to functional endpoints (|ρ| = 0.68-0.78), although measures in other rapidly progressing muscles including the biceps femoris (|ρ| = 0.63-0.73) and peroneals (|ρ| = 0.59-0.72) also showed strong correlations. Quantitative MR biomarkers were excellent indicators of loss of functional ability and correlated with qualitative measures of function. A VL FF of 0.40 was an approximate lower threshold of muscle pathology associated with loss of ambulation.

But how do patients perceive medical and scientific attempts at creating drugs and finding cure, and why? Since the 1990s, a number of clinical trials for patients of DMD have been organized. Among them are a gene therapy and exon skipping, and they indicate the possibility of finding therapies for DMD patients. Since 2011, Japanese medical institutions have been participating in Global Clinical Trials so that Japanese DMD patients can have access to them once developed. Despite ongoing global clinical trials, however, field research shows that the DMD patients the author encountered were neither enthusiastic nor well informed about gene therapies developed in Japan or elsewhere. Why not? The author observed that the desire for a cure among DMD patients is not self-evident, but is framed by sociocultural conditions surrounding the patients, the local history of discrimination against genetic disorders, and the way care is organised. These factors further interplay with physical and mental conditions particular to DMD, affecting patients' desire for a cure. This paper discusses the perception of genomics research and the possibility of a cure of DMD patients the author encountered in Japan, indicating that such perceptions are a result of the deeply-related interactions of the conditions in which patients live. Finally, the author suggests how commonly held views of patients and patients' desire for cure need to be nuanced in genomic medicine.

29481844,Non-Glycanated Biglycan and LTBP4: Leveraging the extracellular matrix for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy therapeutics.,,Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays key roles in normal and diseased skeletal and cardiac muscle. In healthy muscle the ECM is essential for transmitting contractile force, maintaining myofiber integrity and orchestrating cellular signaling. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is caused by loss of dystrophin, a cytosolic protein that anchors a transmembrane complex and serves as a vital link between the actin cytoskeleton and the basal lamina. Loss of dystrophin leads to membrane fragility and impaired signaling, resulting in myofiber death and cycles of inflammation and regeneration. Fibrosis is also a cardinal feature of DMD. In this review, we will focus on two cases where understanding the normal function and regulation of ECM in muscle has led to the discovery of candidate therapeutics for DMD. Biglycan is a small leucine rich repeat ECM protein present as two glycoforms in muscle that have dramatically different functions. One widely expressed form is biglycan proteoglycan (PG) that bears two chondroitin sulfate GAG chains (typically chondroitin sulfate) and two N-linked carbohydrates. The second glycoform, referred to as 'NG' (non-glycanated) biglycan, lacks the GAG side chains. NG, but not PG biglycan recruits utrophin, an autosomal paralog of dystrophin, and an NOS-containing signaling complex to the muscle cell membrane. Recombinant NG biglycan can be systemically delivered to dystrophic mice where it upregulates utrophin at the membrane and improves muscle health and function. An optimized version of NG biglycan, 'TVN-102', is under development as a candidate therapeutic for DMD. A second matrix-embedded protein being evaluated for therapeutic potential is latent TGFβ binding protein 4 (LTBP4). Identified in a genomic screen for modifiers of muscular dystrophy, LTBP4 binds both TGFβ and myostatin. Genetic studies identified the hinge region of LTBP4 as linked to TGFβ release and contributing to the ""hyper-TGFβ"" signaling state that promotes fibrosis in muscular dystrophy. This hinge region can be stabilized by antibodies directed towards this domain. Stabilizing the hinge region of LTBP4 is expected to reduce latent TGFβ release and thus reduce fibrosis.",,,,2018-02-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Understanding perspectives of parents of children who have not participated in trials may facilitate approaches to optimize participation rates. The objective of this study was to explore factors associated with parental interest in enrolling children with pediatric neuromuscular disorders in clinical trials.
Parents of individuals with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy were recruited through advocacy organizations, a registry, and clinics. These parents ( N = 203) completed a questionnaire including assessments of barriers and facilitators to clinical trial participation, parents' interest in trial participation, and their perceptions of others' views about participation in a clinical trial.
Trial interest in participating parents was high (64% combined group).

DMD leads to progressive muscle weakness, degeneration, and wasting; finally, follows with the premature demise in affected individuals due to respiratory and/or cardiac failure typically by age of 30. For decades, scientists tried massively to find an effective therapy method, but there is no absolute cure currently for patients with DMD, nevertheless, recent advanced progressions on the treatment of DMD will be hopeful in the future. Several promising gene therapies are currently under investigation. These include gene replacement, exon skipping, suppression of stop codons. More recently, a promising gene editing tool referred to as CRISPR/Cas9 offers exciting perspectives for restoring dystrophin expression in patients with DMD. This review intents to briefly describe these methods and comment on their advances. Since DMD is a genetic disorder, it should be treated by replacing the deficient DMD copy with a functional one. However, there are different types of mutations in this gene, so such therapeutic approaches are highly mutation specific and thus are personalized. Therefore, DMD has arisen as a model of genetic disorder for understanding and overcoming of the challenges of developing personalized genetic medicines, consequently, the lessons learned from these approaches will be applicable to many other disorders.

DMD is primarily caused by whole exon deletions, resulting in a shift of the dystrophin mRNA reading frame that prevents production of functional dystrophin protein. Eteplirsen, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO), is designed to skip exon 51, restore the reading frame, and induce production of internally shortened dystrophin in patients with mutations amenable to such treatment.
Describe lung function assessed throughout eteplirsen studies 201/202.
Studies 201/202 included 12 patients treated with eteplirsen over 5 years. Pulmonary function tests included forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). With no long-term placebo control, FVC results were compared with data from the United Dystrophinopathy Project (UDP). MIP and MEP were compared to published natural history.
Age-adjusted mixed-model repeated-measures analysis showed decreases of 2.3% and 2.6% annually for FVC% p and MEP% p, and an annual increase of 0.6% for MIP% p for the eteplirsen-treated cohort.

We examined the long-term effects of glucocorticoids on milestone-related disease progression across the lifespan and survival in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
For this prospective cohort study, we enrolled male patients aged 2-28 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy at 20 centres in nine countries. Patients were followed up for 10 years. We compared no glucocorticoid treatment or cumulative treatment duration of less than 1 month versus treatment of 1 year or longer with regard to progression of nine disease-related and clinically meaningful mobility and upper limb milestones. We used Kaplan-Meier analyses to compare glucocorticoid treatment groups for time to stand from supine of 5 s or longer and 10 s or longer, and loss of stand from supine, four-stair climb, ambulation, full overhead reach, hand-to-mouth function, and hand function. Risk of death was also assessed. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00468832.
440 patients were enrolled during two recruitment periods (2006-09 and 2012-16). Time to all disease progression milestone events was significantly longer in patients treated with glucocorticoids for 1 year or longer than in patients treated for less than 1 month or never treated (log-rank p<0·0001). Glucocorticoid treatment for 1 year or longer was associated with increased median age at loss of mobility milestones by 2·1-4·4 years and upper limb milestones by 2·8-8·0 years compared with treatment for less than 1 month. Deflazacort was associated with increased median age at loss of three milestones by 2·1-2·7 years in comparison with prednisone or prednisolone (log-rank p<0·012). 45 patients died during the 10-year follow-up. 39 (87%) of these deaths were attributable to Duchenne-related causes in patients with known duration of glucocorticoids usage. 28 (9%) deaths occurred in 311 patients treated with glucocorticoids for 1 year or longer compared with 11 (19%) deaths in 58 patients with no history of glucocorticoid use (odds ratio 0·47, 95% CI 0·22-1·00; p=0·0501).

29173172,Therapeutic Applications of CRISPR/Cas for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Adeno-associated viruses, CRISPR, Clinical trials, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Dystrophin, Gene therapy",Current gene therapy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by the lack of dystrophin due to mutations in the DMD gene. Since dystrophin is essential in maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemmal membrane, the absence of the protein leads to muscle damage and DMD disease manifestation. Currently, there is no cure with only symptomatic management available.
The most recent advancements in DMD therapies do not provide a permanent treatment for DMD. CRISPR/Cas technology poses as an attractive platform for DMD gene therapy both dependent and independent of the specific mutation.
CRISPR/Cas technology can be utilized independent of the patient mutation by modulating disease modifiers. Regarding DMD duplication mutations, full length dystrophin can be restored using a single sgRNA approach. For DMD deletion and point mutations, the open reading frame (ORF) can be restored by removing or reframing exon(s) to produce a shorter form of dystrophin. The full-length wildtype dystrophin can also be restored using homologous recombination (HR). The CRISPR/Cas components for these strategies were delivered in vivo using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector.
The upregulation of a dystrophin homologue called utrophin can compensate for the lack of dystrophin protein, and has been successfully demonstrated in patient cells. Full-length dystrophin was restored in patient cells carrying duplication mutations. The shorter form and full-length dystrophin was recovered using CRISPR strategies in vitro and in vivo.

Comparing muscle excursions in walking between mice and humans.,"Biomechanics, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Mice, Muscle fiber excursion, Musculoskeletal simulation, Neuromuscular diseases, Walking gait",Skeletal muscle,"The mouse is one of the most widely used animal models to study neuromuscular diseases and test new therapeutic strategies. However, findings from successful pre-clinical studies using mouse models frequently fail to translate to humans due to various factors. Differences in muscle function between the two species could be crucial but often have been overlooked. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare muscle excursions in walking between mice and humans.
Recently published musculoskeletal models of the mouse hindlimb and human lower limb were used to simulate muscle-tendon dynamics during mouse and human walking, a key daily activity. Muscle fiber length changes (fiber excursions) of 25 muscle homologs in the two species were calculated from these simulations and then compared. To understand potential causes of differences in fiber excursions in walking, joint excursions and muscle moment arms were also compared across one gait cycle.
Most muscles (19 out of 25 muscles) of the mouse hindlimb had much smaller fiber excursions as compared to human lower limb muscles during walking. For these muscles, fiber excursions in mice were only 48 ± 19% of those in humans. The differences in fiber excursion between the two species were primarily due to the reduced joint excursions and smaller muscle moment arms in mice as compared to humans.
Since progressive neuromuscular diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, are known to be accelerated by damage accumulated from active muscle lengthening, these results suggest that biomechanical differences in muscle function during walking between mice and humans may impede the translations of knowledge gained from mouse models to humans. This knowledge would add a fresh perspective on how pre-clinical studies on mice might be better designed to improve translation to human clinical trials.",,"Most muscles (19 out of 25 muscles) of the mouse hindlimb had much smaller fiber excursions as compared to human lower limb muscles during walking.

We have shown that the amino acid taurine is safe and effective at preventing dystropathology in the mdx mouse model for DMD. This study aimed to establish if treating growing mdx mice with a higher dose of taurine was more effective at improving strength and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Mice were treated with a dose of taurine estimated to be 16 g/kg/day, in drinking water from 1-6 weeks of age, after which in vivo and ex vivo muscle strength was assessed, as were measures of inflammation, oxidative stress and taurine metabolism. While the dose did decrease inflammation and protein oxidation in dystrophic muscles, there was no improvement in muscle strength (in contrast with benefits observed with the lower dose) and growth of the young mice was significantly restricted. We present novel data that a high taurine dose increases the cysteine content of both mdx liver and plasma, a possible result of down regulation of the taurine synthesis pathway in the liver (which functions to dispose of excess cysteine, which is toxic). These data caution that a high dose of taurine can have adverse effects and may be less efficacious than lower taurine doses. Therefore, monitoring of taurine dosage needs to be considered in future pre-clinical trials, in anticipation of using taurine as a clinical therapy for growing DMD boys (and other conditions).",,,,2017-11-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Many different chemistries of AONs can be used for splice switching modulation, and some of them have been evaluated in clinical trials for DMD. However, despite advances in AON chemistry and design, systemic use of AONs is limited due to poor tissue uptake, and sufficient therapeutic efficacy is difficult to achieve. Therefore, there is still a critical need to develop efficient AONs able to restore the expression of dystrophin in all relevant tissues and international efforts are currently on going to develop new compounds or alternative chemistries with higher therapeutic potential. Here, we describe the methods to evaluate the potency of antisense oligonucleotides, and in particular of tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA)-AONs, a novel class of AONs which displays unique pharmacological properties and unprecedented uptake in many tissues after systemic administration.

A systematic review.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, fat embolism syndrome, fractures",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most frequent lethal genetic disease. Several clinical trials have established both the beneficial effect of steroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the well-known risk of side effects associated with their daily use. For many years it has been known that steroids associated with ambulation loss lead to obesity and also damage the bone structure resulting in the bone density reduction and increased incidence of bone fractures and fat embolism syndrome, an underdiagnosed complication after fractures. Fat embolism syndrome is characterized by consciousness disturbance, respiratory failure and skin rashes. The use of steroids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy may result in vertebral fractures, even without previous trauma. Approximately 25% of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a long bone fracture, and 1% to 22% of fractures have a chance to develop fat embolism syndrome. As the patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have progressive cardiac and respiratory muscle dysfunction, the fat embolism may be unnoticed clinically and may result in increased risk of death and major complications. Different treatments and prevention measures of fat embolism have been proposed; however, so far, there is no efficient therapy. The prevention, early diagnosis and adequate symptomatic treatment are of paramount importance.

29038471,Myoblasts and macrophages are required for therapeutic morpholino antisense oligonucleotide delivery to dystrophic muscle.,,Nature communications,"Exon skipping is a promising therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), employing morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (PMO-AO) to exclude disruptive exons from the mutant DMD transcript and elicit production of truncated dystrophin protein. Clinical trials for PMO show variable and sporadic dystrophin rescue. Here, we show that robust PMO uptake and efficient production of dystrophin following PMO administration coincide with areas of myofiber regeneration and inflammation. PMO localization is sustained in inflammatory foci where it enters macrophages, actively differentiating myoblasts and newly forming myotubes. We conclude that efficient PMO delivery into muscle requires two concomitant events: first, accumulation and retention of PMO within inflammatory foci associated with dystrophic lesions, and second, fusion of PMO-loaded myoblasts into repairing myofibers. Identification of these factors accounts for the variability in clinical trials and suggests strategies to improve this therapeutic approach to DMD.Exon skipping is a strategy for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but has variable efficacy.

Some newer therapeutic interventions aim to increase sarcolemmal dystrophin expression, and accurate dystrophin quantification is critical for demonstrating pharmacodynamic relationships in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Current challenges with measuring dystrophin include the variation in protein expression within individual muscle fibers and across whole muscle samples, the presence of preexisting dystrophin-positive revertant fibers, and trace amounts of residual dystrophin. Immunofluorescence quantification of dystrophin can overcome many of these challenges, but manual quantification of protein expression may be complicated by variations in the collection of images, reproducible scoring of fluorescent intensity, and bias introduced by manual scoring of typically only a few high-power fields.

The evolution of legal and regulatory restrictions to the marketing and sale of pharmaceuticals has spanned more than a century, and throughout this history, patient advocacy has played a significant role. Scientific evidence from clinical trials serves as the foundation for drug approval, but the patient voice has become increasingly influential. Although the gold standard for establishing safety and efficacy through randomized controlled trials has been in place for more than 50 years, it poses several limitations for rare disorders where patient recruitment for traditional clinical trials is a major barrier. Organized efforts by patient advocacy groups to help patients with rare diseases access investigational therapy have had a legislative and regulatory effect. After approval by the FDA, patient access to therapy may still be limited by cost. A managed care organization (MCO) with the fiduciary responsibility of managing the health of a population must weigh coverage decisions for costly therapies with questionable effectiveness against alternatives within the constraint of a finite budget. Even when the FDA deems a drug safe and effective, an MCO may determine that the drug should only be made available at a tier level where out-of-pocket costs are still too high for many patients. This limitation of availability may be due to cost, other treatment alternatives, or outcomes from existing clinical evidence. However, if the MCO makes a costly new treatment for a rare disease readily available, it may temporarily satisfy a small contingency at the cost of all of its members. This article examines the risks and benefits of patient-centered drug approval and the potential economic effect of patient-centered drug approval on population health.

Gene therapy using highly functional microdystrophin genes and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors is an attractive strategy to treat DMD. Here we show that locoregional and systemic delivery of a rAAV2/8 vector expressing a canine microdystrophin (cMD1) is effective in restoring dystrophin expression and stabilizing clinical symptoms in studies performed on a total of 12 treated golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs. Locoregional delivery induces high levels of microdystrophin expression in limb musculature and significant amelioration of histological and functional parameters. Systemic intravenous administration without immunosuppression results in significant and sustained levels of microdystrophin in skeletal muscles and reduces dystrophic symptoms for over 2 years. No toxicity or adverse immune consequences of vector administration are observed. These studies indicate safety and efficacy of systemic rAAV-cMD1 delivery in a large animal model of DMD, and pave the way towards clinical trials of rAAV-microdystrophin gene therapy in DMD patients.",,,,2017-07-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Data on age when loss of independent ambulation occurs are well established for DMD; however, age at onset of walking has not been well described. We hypothesize that an effective medication given in early infancy would advance the age when walking is achieved so that it is closer to age-matched norms, and that this discrete event could serve as the primary outcome measure in a clinical trial. This study examined three data sets, Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet); Dutch Natural History Survey (DNHS); and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD).

Dystrophin deficiency is the underlying cause of disease; therefore, mutation-specific therapies aimed at restoring dystrophin protein production are being explored. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ataluren in ambulatory boys with nonsense mutation DMD.
We did this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 54 sites in 18 countries located in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America. Boys aged 7-16 years with nonsense mutation DMD and a baseline 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of 150 m or more and 80% or less of the predicted normal value for age and height were randomly assigned (1:1), via permuted block randomisation (block size of four) using an interactive voice-response or web-response system, to receive ataluren orally three times daily (40 mg/kg per day) or matching placebo. Randomisation was stratified by age (<9 years vs ≥9 years), duration of previous corticosteroid use (6 months to <12 months vs ≥12 months), and baseline 6MWD (<350 m vs ≥350 m). Patients, parents and caregivers, investigational site personnel, PTC Therapeutics employees, and all other study personnel were masked to group allocation until after database lock. The primary endpoint was change in 6MWD from baseline to week 48. We additionally did a prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint, based on baseline 6MWD, which is reflective of anticipated rates of disease progression over 1 year. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01826487.
Between March 26, 2013, and Aug 26, 2014, we randomly assigned 230 patients to receive ataluren (n=115) or placebo (n=115); 228 patients comprised the intention-to-treat population. The least-squares mean change in 6MWD from baseline to week 48 was -47·7 m (SE 9·3) for ataluren-treated patients and -60·7 m (9·3) for placebo-treated patients (difference 13·0 m [SE 10·4], 95% CI -7·4 to 33·4; p=0·213). The least-squares mean change for ataluren versus placebo in the prespecified subgroups was -7·7 m (SE 24·1, 95% CI -54·9 to 39·5; p=0·749) in the group with a 6MWD of less than 300 m, 42·9 m (15·9, 11·8-74·0; p=0·007) in the group with a 6MWD of 300 m or more to less than 400 m, and -9·5 m (17·2, -43·2 to 24·2; p=0·580) in the group with a 6MWD of 400 m or more. Ataluren was generally well tolerated and most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Eight (3%) patients (n=4 per group) reported serious adverse events; all except one event in the placebo group (abnormal hepatic function deemed possibly related to treatment) were deemed unrelated to treatment.
Change in 6MWD did not differ significantly between patients in the ataluren group and those in the placebo group, neither in the intention-to-treat population nor in the prespecified subgroups with a baseline 6MWD of less than 300 m or 400 m or more. However, we recorded a significant effect of ataluren in the prespecified subgroup of patients with a baseline 6MWD of 300 m or more to less than 400 m. Baseline 6MWD values within this range were associated with a more predictable rate of decline over 1 year; this finding has implications for the design of future DMD trials with the 6-minute walk test as the endpoint.

There are presently no curative therapies for these diseases, but a range of potential therapies are presently reaching the stage of multi-centre, multi-national first-in-man clinical trials. There is a need for sensitive, objective end-points to assess the efficacy of the proposed therapies.

Cell therapy is an alternative to life-long corticoid therapy. Satellite cells, the stem cells of skeletal muscles, do not completely compensate for the muscle damage in dystrophic muscles. Elevated levels of proinflammatory and profibrotic factors, such as metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), impair muscle regeneration, leading to extensive fibrosis and poor results with myoblast transplantation therapies. Omega-3 is an anti-inflammatory drug that protects against muscle degeneration in the mdx mouse model of DMD. In the present study, we test our hypothesis that omega-3 affects MMP-9 and thereby benefits muscle regeneration and myoblast transplantation in the mdx mouse. We observe that omega-3 reduces MMP-9 gene expression and improves myoblast engraftment, satellite cell activation, and muscle regeneration by mechanisms involving, at least in part, the regulation of macrophages, as shown here with the fluorescence-activated cell sorting technique.

For a long time, there was no effective cure; however, advances in molecular biology have allowed the development of radical treatment approaches. Among them, exon-skipping therapy using antisense oligonucleotides is very promising, because it corrects the reading frame of the dystrophin-encoding gene and restores protein expression, resulting in the conversion of DMD to a clinically milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). However, clinical trials in exon-skipping therapy did not provide satisfactory results, which may be attributed to inefficient exon skipping, low expression level of restored dystrophin and inadequate methods of muscle function evaluation. To date, exon-skipping approaches have particularly focused on the correction of the gene-reading frame. However, the problem is that the relationship between the resultant and expected phenotypes in terms of definite symptomatic improvement has not yet been elucidated. In other words, previously conducted clinical trials have not been planned based on the comprehensive assessment of genotype-phenotype relationship in BMD, which demonstrates a broad range of symptom severity depending on the functional activity of the truncated dystrophin.

To estimate DMD-associated resource utilization and costs in a sample of patients identified via a claims-based algorithm using diagnosis codes, pharmacy prescriptions, and procedure codes unique to DMD management based on DMD clinical milestones.
DMD patients were selected from a commercially insured claims database (2000-2009). Patients with claims suggestive of a non-DMD diagnosis or who were aged 30 years or older were excluded. Each DMD patient was matched by age, gender, and region to controls without DMD in a 1:10 ratio (DMD patients n = 75; controls n = 750). All-cause health care resource utilization, including emergency department, inpatient, outpatient, and physician office visits, and all-cause health care costs were examined over a minimum 1-year period. Costs were computed as total health-plan and patient-paid amounts of adjudicated medical claims (in annualized U.S. dollars).
The average age of the DMD cohort was 13 years. Patients in the DMD cohort had a 10-fold increase in health care costs compared with controls ($23,005 vs. $2,277, P < 0.001).

The absence of dystrophin leads to myofiber membrane fragility and necrosis, with eventual muscle atrophy and contractures. Affected boys typically die in their second or third decade due to either respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy. Despite extensive attempts to develop definitive therapies for DMD, the standard of care remains prednisone, which has only palliative benefits. Animal models, mainly the mdx mouse and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog, have played a key role in studies of DMD pathogenesis and treatment development. Because the GRMD clinical syndrome is more severe than in mice, better aligning with the progressive course of DMD, canine studies may translate better to humans. The original founder dog for all GRMD colonies worldwide was identified in the early 1980s before the discovery of the DMD gene and dystrophin. Accordingly, analogies to DMD were initially drawn based on similar clinical features, ranging from the X-linked pattern of inheritance to overlapping histopathologic lesions. Confirmation of genetic homology between DMD and GRMD came with identification of the underlying GRMD mutation, a single nucleotide change that leads to exon skipping and an out-of-frame DMD transcript. GRMD colonies have subsequently been established to conduct pathogenetic and preclinical treatment studies. Simultaneous with the onset of GRMD treatment trials, phenotypic biomarkers were developed, allowing definitive characterization of treatment effect. Importantly, GRMD studies have not always substantiated findings from mdx mice and have sometimes identified serious treatment side effects. While the GRMD model may be more clinically relevant than the mdx mouse, usage has been limited by practical considerations related to expense and the number of dogs available. This further complicates ongoing broader concerns about the poor rate of translation of animal model preclinical studies to humans with analogous diseases. Accordingly, in performing GRMD trials, special attention must be paid to experimental design to align with the approach used in DMD clinical trials. This review provides context for the GRMD model, beginning with its original description and extending to its use in preclinical trials.",,,,2017-05-21,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We are conducting a clinical trial that (1) compares the 3 most frequently prescribed corticosteroid regimes; (2) standardizes treatment of DMD complications; and (3) standardizes prevention of corticosteroid side effects. Investigators at 38 sites in 5 countries plan to recruit 300 boys aged 4-7 who are randomly assigned to one of three regimens: daily prednisone; daily deflazacort; or intermittent prednisone (10days on/10days off). Boys are followed for a minimum of 3years to assess the relative effectiveness and adverse event profiles of the different regimens. The primary outcome is a 3-dimensional variable consisting of log-transformed time to rise from the floor, forced vital capacity, and subject/parent satisfaction with treatment, each averaged over all post-baseline visits. The study protocol includes evidence- and consensus-based treatment of DMD complications and of corticosteroid side effects. This study seeks to establish a standard corticosteroid regimen for DMD. Since all new interventions for DMD are being developed as add-on therapies to corticosteroids, defining the optimum regimen is of importance for all new treatments.",,,,2017-04-30,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
28427100,Dystrophinopathies and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies.,,Neuropediatrics,"Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases. The natural history of these disorders along with their management have changed mainly due to a better understanding of their pathophysiology, the evolution of standards of care, and new treatment options. Dystrophinopathies include both Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophies, but in reality they are a spectrum of muscle diseases caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the protein dystrophin. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is the most common form of inherited muscle disease of childhood. The current standards of care considerably prolong independent ambulation and survival. Several therapeutic options either aiming at substituting/correcting the primary protein defect or limiting the progression of the dystrophic process are currently being explored in clinical trials.Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are rare and heterogeneous conditions, characterized by weakness and wasting of the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Originally classified into dominant and recessive, > 30 genetic forms of LGMDs are currently recognized. Further understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of LGMD will help identifying novel therapeutic approaches that can be tested in clinical trials.",,,,2017-04-21,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

DMD is among the most common genetic diseases, and isolation of the defective gene (DMD, or dystrophin) was a landmark discovery, as it was the first time a human disease gene had been cloned without knowledge of the protein product. Despite tremendous obstacles, including the enormous size of the gene and the large volume of muscle tissue in the human body, efforts to devise a treatment based on gene replacement have advanced steadily through the combined efforts of dozens of labs and patient advocacy groups.

Nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked childhood muscle wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Nanobiotechnology-based therapies (such as synthetic nanoparticles and naturally existing viral and nonviral nanoparticles) hold great promise to replace and repair the mutated dystrophin gene and significantly change the disease course. While a majority of DMD nanotherapies are still in early preclinical development, several [such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated systemic micro-dystrophin gene therapy] are advancing for phase I clinical trials. Recent regulatory approval of Ataluren (a nonsense mutation read-through chemical) in Europe and Exondys51 (an exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotide drug) in the United States shall offer critical insight in how to move DMD nanotherapy to human patients. Progress in novel, optimized nano-delivery systems may further improve emerging molecular therapeutic modalities for DMD. Despite these progresses, DMD nanotherapy faces a number of unique challenges. Specifically, the dystrophin gene is one of the largest genes in the genome while nanoparticles have an inherent size limitation per definition. Furthermore, muscle is the largest tissue in the body and accounts for 40% of the body mass. How to achieve efficient bodywide muscle targeting in human patients with nanomedication remains a significant translational hurdle. New creative approaches in the design of the miniature micro-dystrophin gene, engineering of muscle-specific synthetic AAV capsids, and novel nanoparticle-mediated exon-skipping are likely to result in major breakthroughs in DMD therapy.

Until recently there were no effective therapies for these conditions, but antisense oligonucleotides, a new class of synthetic single stranded molecules of nucleic acids, have demonstrated promising experimental results and are at different stages of regulatory approval. The antisense oligonucleotides can modulate the protein expression via targeting hnRNAs or mRNAs and inducing interference with splicing, mRNA degradation, or arrest of translation, finally, resulting in rescue or reduction of the target protein expression. Different classes of antisense oligonucleotides are being tested in several clinical trials, and limitations of their clinical efficacy and toxicity have been reported for some of these compounds, while more encouraging results have supported the development of others. New generation antisense oligonucleotides are also being tested in preclinical models together with specific delivery systems that could allow some of the limitations of current antisense oligonucleotides to be overcome, to improve the cell penetration, to achieve more robust target engagement, and hopefully also be associated with acceptable toxicity. This review article describes the chemical properties and molecular mechanisms of action of the antisense oligonucleotides and the therapeutic implications these compounds have in neuromuscular diseases. Current strategies and carrier systems available for the oligonucleotides delivery will be also described to provide an overview on the past, present and future of these appealing molecules.",,,,2017-04-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To provide these detailed data, we developed a comprehensive database based on registered DMD patients from South China and analysed their clinical and mutational characteristics. The database included DMD registrants confirmed by clinical presentation, family history, genetic detection, prognostic outcome, and/or muscle biopsy. Clinical data were collected by a registry form. Mutations of dystrophin were detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing. Currently, 132 DMD patients from 128 families in South China have been registered, and 91.7% of them were below 10 years old. In mutational detection, large deletions were the most frequent type (57.8%), followed by small deletion/insertion mutations (14.1%), nonsense mutations (13.3%), large duplications (10.9%), and splice site mutations (3.1%). Clinical analysis revealed that most patients reported initial symptoms between 1 and 3 years of age, but the diagnostic age was more frequently between 6 and 8 years. 81.4% of patients were ambulatory. Baseline cardiac assessments at diagnosis were conducted in 39.4% and 29.5% of patients by echocardiograms and electrocardiograms, respectively. Only 22.7% of registrants performed baseline respiratory assessments. A small numbers of patients (20.5%) were treated with glucocorticoids. 13.3% of patients were eligible for stop codon read-through therapy, and 48.4% of patients would potentially benefit from exon skipping. The top five exon skips applicable to the largest group of registrants were skipping of exons 51 (14.8% of total mutations), 53 (12.5%), 45 (7.0%), 55 (4.7%), and 44 (3.9%). In conclusion, our database provided information on the natural history, diagnosis and management status of DMD in South China, as well as potential molecular therapies suitable for these patients.

Current DMD gene therapy strategies rely on the expression of internally deleted forms of dystrophin, missing important functional domains. Viral gene transfer of full-length dystrophin could restore wild-type functionality, although this approach is restricted by the limited capacity of recombinant viral vectors. Lentiviral vectors can package larger transgenes than adeno-associated viruses, yet lentiviral vectors remain largely unexplored for full-length dystrophin delivery. In our work, we have demonstrated that lentiviral vectors can package and deliver inserts of a similar size to dystrophin. We report a novel approach for delivering large transgenes in lentiviruses, in which we demonstrate proof-of-concept for a 'template-switching' lentiviral vector that harnesses recombination events during reverse-transcription. During this work, we discovered that a standard, unmodified lentiviral vector was efficient in delivering full-length dystrophin to target cells, within a total genomic load of more than 15,000 base pairs. We have demonstrated gene therapy with this vector by restoring dystrophin expression in DMD myoblasts, where dystrophin was expressed at the sarcolemma of myotubes after myogenic differentiation.

We studied fat replacement along the proximodistal muscle axis using the Dixon technique on a 3T MR scanner in 22 DMD patients and 12 healthy controls. Mean fat fractions per muscle per slice for seven lower and upper leg muscles were compared between and within groups assuming a parabolic distribution. Average fat fraction for a small central slice stack and a large coverage slice stack were compared to the value when the stack was shifted one slice (15 mm) up or down. Higher fat fractions were observed in distal and proximal muscle segments compared to the muscle belly in all muscles of the DMD subjects (p <0.001). A shift of 15 mm resulted in a difference in mean fat fraction which was on average 1-2% ranging up to 12% (p <0.01). The muscle end regions are exposed to higher mechanical strain, which points towards mechanical disruption of the sarcolemma as one of the key factors in the pathophysiology. Overall, this non-uniformity in fat replacement needs to be taken into account to prevent sample bias when applying quantitative MRI as biomarker in clinical trials for DMD.",,,,2017-03-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

There is considerable inter-patient variability in disease onset and progression, which can confound the results of clinical trials. Here we show that a common null polymorphism (R577X) in ACTN3 results in significantly reduced muscle strength and a longer 10 m walk test time in young, ambulant patients with DMD; both of which are primary outcome measures in clinical trials. We have developed a double knockout mouse model, which also shows reduced muscle strength, but is protected from stretch-induced eccentric damage with age. This suggests that α-actinin-3 deficiency reduces muscle performance at baseline, but ameliorates the progression of dystrophic pathology. Mechanistically, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency triggers an increase in oxidative muscle metabolism through activation of calcineurin, which likely confers the protective effect.

However, the development of systemically delivered antisense therapeutics has been hampered by poor tissue penetration and cellular uptake, including crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach targets in the central nervous system (CNS). For SMA application, we have investigated the ability of various BBB-crossing peptides for CNS delivery of a splice-switching phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) targeting survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7 inclusion. We identified a branched derivative of the well-known ApoE (141-150) peptide, which as a PMO conjugate was capable of exon inclusion in the CNS following systemic administration, leading to an increase in the level of full-length SMN2 transcript. Treatment of newborn SMA mice with this peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugate resulted in a significant increase in the average lifespan and gains in weight, muscle strength, and righting reflexes. Systemic treatment of adult SMA mice with this newly identified P-PMO also resulted in small but significant increases in the levels of SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) exon inclusion in the CNS and peripheral tissues.

Good practice in the care of those with DMD requires prevention of these adverse effects. Treatments to increase bone mineral density include bisphosphonates and vitamin D and calcium supplements, and in adolescents with pubertal delay, testosterone. Bone health management is an important part of lifelong care for patients with DMD.
To assess the effects of interventions to prevent or treat osteoporosis in children and adults with DMD taking long-term corticosteroids; to assess the effects of these interventions on the frequency of vertebral fragility fractures and long-bone fractures, and on quality of life; and to assess adverse events.
On 12 September 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus to identify potentially eligible trials. We also searched the Web of Science ISI Proceedings (2001 to September 2016) and three clinical trials registries to identify unpublished studies and ongoing trials. We contacted correspondence authors of the included studies in the review to obtain information on unpublished studies or work in progress.
We considered for inclusion in the review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving any bone health intervention for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and fragility fractures in children, adolescents, and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD. The interventions might have included oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, vitamin D supplements, calcium supplements, dietary calcium, testosterone, and weight-bearing activity.
Two review authors independently assessed reports and selected potential studies for inclusion, following standard Cochrane methodology. We contacted study authors to obtain further information for clarification on published work, unpublished studies, and work in progress.
We identified 18 potential studies, of which two, currently reported only as abstracts, met the inclusion criteria for this review. Too little information was available for us to present full results or adequately assess risk of bias. The participants were children aged five to 15 years with DMD, ambulant and non-ambulant. The interventions were risedronate versus no treatment in one trial (13 participants) and whole-body vibration versus a placebo device in the second (21 participants). Both studies reported improved bone mineral density with the active treatments, with no improvement in the control groups, but the abstracts did not compare treatment and control conditions. All children tolerated whole-body vibration treatment. No study provided information on adverse events. Two studies are ongoing: one investigating whole-body vibration, the other investigating zoledronic acid.
We know of no high-quality evidence from RCTs to guide use of treatments to prevent or treat corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and reduce the risk of fragility fractures in children and adults with DMD; only limited results from two trials reported in abstracts were available. We await formal trial reports. Findings from two ongoing relevant studies and two trials, for which only abstracts are available, will be important in future updates of this review.",,,,2017-01-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

28076894,Electrical impedance myography for assessment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Annals of neurology,"Sensitive, objective, and easily applied methods for evaluating disease progression and response to therapy are needed for clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, we evaluated whether electrical impedance myography (EIM) could serve this purpose.
In this nonblinded study, 36 boys with DMD and 29 age-similar healthy boys underwent multifrequency EIM measurements for up to 2 years on 6 muscles unilaterally along with functional assessments. A linear mixed-effects model with random intercept and slope terms was used for the analysis of multifrequency EIM values and functional measures. Seven DMD boys were initiated on corticosteroids; these data were analyzed using a piecewise linear mixed-effects model.
In boys > 7.0 years old, a significant difference in the slope of EIM phase ratio trajectories in the upper extremity was observed by 6 months of -0.074/month, p = 0.023, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.013, -0.14; at 2 years, this difference was -0.048/month, p < 0.0001, 95% CI = -0.028, -0.068. In boys ≤ 7.0 years old, differences appeared at 6 months in gastrocnemius (EIM phase slope = -0.83 °/kHz/mo, p = 0.007, 95% CI = -0.26, -1.40). EIM outcomes showed significant differences earlier than functional tests. Initiation of corticosteroids significantly improved the slope of EIM phase ratio (0.057/mo, p = 0.00019, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.086) and EIM phase slope (0.14 °/kHz/mo, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 0.028, 0.25), consistent with corticosteroids' known clinical benefit.
EIM detects deterioration in muscles of both younger and older boys by 6 months; it also identifies the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid initiation.

Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) is a bifunctional orally administered small molecule that covalently links 2 compounds known to inhibit NF-κB, salicylic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Edasalonexent is designed to inhibit activated NF-κB upon intracellular cleavage to these bioactive components. Preclinical data demonstrate disease-modifying activity in DMD animal models. Three placebo-controlled studies in adult subjects assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single or multiple edasalonexent doses up to 6000 mg. Seventy-nine adult subjects received edasalonexent, and 25 received placebo. Pharmacokinetic results were consistent with the intracellular cleavage of edasalonexent to its active components. Food increased plasma exposures of edasalonexent and salicyluric acid, an intracellularly formed metabolite of salicylic acid. The NF-κB pathway and proteosome gene expression profiles in peripheral mononuclear cells were significantly decreased (P = .02 and P = .002, respectively) after 2 weeks of edasalonexent treatment. NF-κB activity was inhibited following a single dose of edasalonexent but not by equimolar doses of salicylic acid and DHA. Edasalonexent was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were mild diarrhea and headache. In first-in-human studies, edasalonexent was safe, well tolerated, and inhibited activated NF-κB pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic utility in DMD regardless of the causative dystrophin mutation, as well as other NF-κB-mediated diseases.",,,,2017-01-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, to exploit their potential it is necessary to improve and standardize their detection. In a previous study, we identified two microRNAs, miR-30c and miR-181a, that appear to be key regulators of muscular dystrophy. We hypothesized that they could represent useful biomarkers of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD). The objective of this study was to assess the absolute levels of miR-30c and miR-181a in sera of DMD and BMD patients using digital PCR (a robust technique for precise and direct quantification of small amounts of nucleic acids without standard curves and external references), and investigate the correlation between miR-30c and miR-181a expressions and several clinical parameters. Our results show that the serum levels of miR-30c and miR-181a increased 7- and 6-fold respectively in DMD patients (n = 21, 2-14 years, ambulant), and 7-fold in BMD patients (n = 5, 9-15 years) compared to controls (n = 22, 2-14 years). No association between miRNA levels and age or corticosteroid treatment was detected in DMD. However, there was a trend towards higher levels of miR-30c in DMD patients with better preserved motor function according to various motor scales and timed tests. We demonstrate that digital PCR is a useful technique for accurate absolute quantification of microRNAs in sera of DMD/BMD patients. We propose miR-30c and miR-181a as reliable serum diagnostic biomarkers for DMD and BMD and miR-30c as a potential novel biomarker to assess disease severity in DMD.",,,,2016-12-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To assess the effect of early angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy in patients with normal left ventricular function on the progression of myocardial fibrosis (MF) identified on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).
A randomized clinical trial conducted in 2 centers included 76 male patients with DMD or BMD undergoing 2 CMR studies with a 2-year interval for ventricular function and MF assessment. In a non-intent-to-treat trial, 42 patients with MF and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were randomized (1:1) to receive or not receive ACE inhibitor therapy. The study was conducted from June 26, 2009, to June 30, 2012. Data analysis was performed from June 30, 2013, to October 3, 2016.
Randomization (1:1) to receive or not receive ACE inhibitor therapy.
Primary outcome was MF progression from baseline to the 2-year CMR study.
Of the 76 male patients included in the study, 70 had DMD (92%) and 6 had BMD (8%); mean (SD) age at baseline was 13.1 (4.4) years. Myocardial fibrosis was present in 55 patients (72%) and LV systolic dysfunction was identified in 13 patients (24%). Myocardial fibrosis at baseline was an independent indicator of lower LVEF at follow-up (coefficient [SE], -0.16 [0.07]; P = .03). Among patients with MF and preserved LVEF (42 [55%]), those randomized (21 patients in each arm) to receive ACE inhibitors demonstrated slower MF progression compared with the untreated group (mean [SD] increase of 3.1% [7.4%] vs 10.0% [6.2%] as a percentage of LV mass; P = .001). In multivariate analysis, ACE inhibitor therapy was an independent indicator of decreased MF progression (coefficient [SE], -4.51 [2.11]; P = .04). Patients with MF noted on CMR had a higher probability of cardiovascular events (event rate, 10 of 55 [18.2%] vs 0 of 21 [0%]; log-rank P = .04).
In this 2-year, follow-up, randomized clinical trial of patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy whose LVEF was preserved and MF was present as determined on CMR, ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with significantly slower progression of MF.

However, there are no drugs currently available that can specifically down-regulate mast cell function in vivo when chronically administered. Here, we describe an innovative approach for targeting mast cells in vitro and in vivo using antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping of the β-subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRIβ) to eliminate surface high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expression and function, rendering mast cells unresponsive to IgE-mediated activation. As FcεRIβ expression is restricted to mast cells and basophils, this approach would selectively target these cell types. Given the success of exon skipping in clinical trials to treat genetic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we propose that exon skipping of FcεRIβ is a potential approach for mast cell-specific treatment of allergic diseases.",,,,2016-11-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Several methods have been reported to detect and quantify dystrophin restoration in preclinical and clinical trials. We here evaluated the applicability of dystrophin specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and a TaqMan protein assay, benchmarking them against Western blotting analysis. Despite numerous optimization attempts, in our hands the background signals in the ELISA and TaqMan protein assays were too high to allow dystrophin quantification.

For clinical trials and supportive animal studies, DMD disease progression and response to treatment must be established using outcome parameters (biomarkers). The 6-minute walk test (6MWT), defined as the distance an individual can walk in 6 minutes, is commonly used in DMD clinical trials and has been employed in dogs to characterize cardiac and respiratory disease severity. Building on methods established in DMD and canine clinical studies, we assessed the 6MWT in dogs with the DMD genetic homolog, golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD). Twenty-one cross-bred golden retrievers were categorized as affected (DMD mutation and GRMD phenotype), carrier (female heterozygous for DMD mutation and no phenotype), and normal (wild type DMD gene and normal phenotype). When compared to grouped normal/carrier dogs, GRMD dogs walked shorter height-adjusted distances at 6 and 12 months of age and their distances walked declined with age. Percent change in creatine kinase after 6MWT was greater in GRMD versus normal/carrier dogs at 6 months, providing another potential biomarker. While these data generally support use of the 6MWT as a biomarker for preclinical GRMD treatment trials, there were certain limitations. Results of the 6MWT did not correlate with other outcome parameters for GRMD dogs when considered alone and an 80% increase in mean distance walked would be necessary to achieve satisfactory power.",,,,2016-11-08,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Although the primary defect is the deficiency of muscle dystrophin, secondary events, including chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle regeneration failure are thought to actively contribute to disease progression. Despite several advances, there is still no effective therapy for DMD. Therefore, the potential regenerative capacities, and immune-privileged properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have been the focus of intense investigation in different animal models aiming the treatment of these disorders. However, these studies have shown different outcomes according to the sources from which MSCs were obtained, which raise the question whether stem cells from distinct sources have comparable clinical effects. Here, we analyzed the protein content of the secretome of MSCs, isolated from three different sources (adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and uterine tubes), obtained from five donors and evaluated their in vitro properties when cocultured with DMD myoblasts. All MSC lineages showed pathways enrichment related to protein metabolic process, oxidation-reduction process, cell proliferation, and regulation of apoptosis. We found that MSCs secretome proteins and their effect in vitro vary significantly according to the tissue and donors, including opposite effects in apoptosis assay, indicating the importance of characterizing MSC secretome profile before its use in animal and clinical trials.

We developed a prediction model for 1-year change in the six minute walk distance (6MWD) among DMD patients, and compared its predictive value to that of commonly used prognostic factors (age, baseline 6MWD, and steroid use).
Natural history data were collected from DMD patients at routine follow up visits approximately every 6 months over the course of 2-5 years. Assessments included ambulatory function and steroid use. The annualized change in 6MWD (Δ6MWD) was studied between all pairs of visits separated by 8-16 months.

Among n = 191 follow-up intervals (n = 39 boys), mean starting age was 9.4 years, mean starting 6MWD was 351.8 meters, and 75% had received steroids for at least one year. Over the subsequent 8-16 months, mean Δ6MWD was -37.0 meters with a standard deviation (SD) of 93.7 meters. Predictions based on a composite of age, baseline 6MWD, and steroid use explained 28% of variation in Δ6MWD (R2 = 0.28, residual SD = 79.4 meters). A broadened prognostic model, adding timed 10-meter walk/run, 4-stair climb, and rise from supine, as well as height and weight, significantly improved prediction, explaining 59% of variation in Δ6MWD after cross-validation (R2 = 0.59, residual SD = 59.7 meters).
A prognostic model incorporating timed function tests significantly improved prediction of 1-year changes in 6MWD.

The process involved integrating patients and caregivers of people with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy, advocates, clinicians, and the sponsor in conceptualizing and developing a benefit-risk survey on the basis of phase III trial results.
Our community-engagement process for the development of a stated-preference survey included a set of five guiding principles with a foundation in the principles of community-engaged research. Engagement efforts were carried out through an informal network of three committees. Members of the leadership, stakeholder, and review committees comprised patients, caregivers, clinicians, advocacy leadership, and industry representatives.
Committee members participated in 15 hours of formal engagement including interviews and conference calls that ranged from 45 to 90 minutes, plus additional less-formal ad hoc communication. Committees comprised 20 individuals across three committees including adults with DMD (n = 6), parents of children with DMD (n = 6), clinicians (n = 3), members of research and advocacy organizations (n = 4), and an industry representative (n = 1). Community engagement informed attribute selection, survey length, word choice, and eligibility criteria. Challenges in the process included managing diverse stakeholder perspectives, time requirements, and the inherent tension between outcomes used in clinical trials versus attributes that correspond to patient- and family-relevant outcomes.

Clinical trials currently rely on invasive biopsies or motivation-dependent functional tests to assess outcome. Quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could offer a valuable alternative and permit inclusion of non-ambulant DMD subjects. The aims of our study were to explore the responsiveness of upper-limb MRI muscle-fat measurement as a non-invasive objective endpoint for clinical trials in non-ambulant DMD, and to investigate the relationship of these MRI measures to those of muscle force and function.
15 non-ambulant DMD boys (mean age 13.3 y) and 10 age-gender matched healthy controls (mean age 14.6 y) were recruited. 3-Tesla MRI fat-water quantification was used to measure forearm muscle fat transformation in non-ambulant DMD boys compared with healthy controls. DMD boys were assessed at 4 time-points over 12 months, using 3-point Dixon MRI to measure muscle fat-fraction (f.f.). Images from ten forearm muscles were segmented and mean f.f. and cross-sectional area recorded. DMD subjects also underwent comprehensive upper limb function and force evaluation.
Overall mean baseline forearm f.f. was higher in DMD than in healthy controls (p<0.001). A progressive f.f. increase was observed in DMD over 12 months, reaching significance from 6 months (p<0.001, n = 7), accompanied by a significant loss in pinch strength at 6 months (p<0.001, n = 9) and a loss of upper limb function and grip force observed over 12 months (p<0.001, n = 8).
These results support the use of MRI muscle f.f. as a biomarker to monitor disease progression in the upper limb in non-ambulant DMD, with sensitivity adequate to detect group-level change over time intervals practical for use in clinical trials. Clinical validity is supported by the association of the progressive fat transformation of muscle with loss of muscle force and function.",,"Overall mean baseline forearm f.f. was higher in DMD than in healthy controls (p<0.001).

Skeletal muscle dystrophin was quantified by immunoblot. We grouped deletions ending on exon 45 (""del 45-x"", n = 28) or 51 (""del x-51"", n = 10); isolated exon 48 deletion (""del 48"", n = 10); and other mutations (n = 21). Only patients in the ""del 45-x"" or ""other"" groups became non-ambulatory (n = 5, log-rank p = n.s.) or unable to run (n = 22, p < 0.001). All measures correlated positively with dystrophin quantity and negatively with age, and were significantly more impaired in the ""del 45-x"" and ""other"" groups.

The aims of this study were to characterize inspiratory function and to assess the efficacy of idebenone on this pulmonary function outcome in a large and well-characterized cohort of 10-18 year-old DMD patients not taking glucocorticoid steroids (GCs) enrolled in the phase 3 randomized controlled DELOS trial. We evaluated the effect of idebenone on the highest flow generated during an inspiratory FVC maneuver (maximum inspiratory flow; V'I,max(FVC)) and the ratio between the largest inspiratory flow during tidal breathing (tidal inspiratory flow; V'I,max(t)) and the V'I,max(FVC). The fraction of the maximum flow that is not used during tidal breathing has been termed inspiratory flow reserve (IFR). DMD patients in both treatment groups of DELOS (idebenone, n = 31; placebo: n = 33) had comparable and abnormally low V'I,max(FVC) at baseline. During the study period, V'I,max(FVC) further declined by -0.29 L/sec in patients on placebo (95%CI: -0.51, -0.08; P = 0.008 at week 52), whereas it remained stable in patients on idebenone (change from baseline to week 52: 0.01 L/sec; 95%CI: -0.22, 0.24; P = 0.950). The between-group difference favoring idebenone was 0.27 L/sec (P = 0.043) at week 26 and 0.30 L/sec (P = 0.061) at week 52. In addition, during the study period, IFR improved by 2.8% in patients receiving idebenone and worsened by -3.0% among patients on placebo (between-group difference 5.8% at week 52; P = 0.040). Although the clinical interpretation of these data is currently limited due to the scarcity of routine clinical practice experience with dynamic inspiratory function outcomes in DMD, these findings from a randomized controlled study nevertheless suggest that idebenone preserved inspiratory muscle function as assessed by V'I,max(FVC) and IFR in patients with DMD.

Givinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, significantly reduced fibrosis and promoted compensatory muscle regeneration in mdx mice. This study was conducted to evaluate whether the beneficial histological effects of Givinostat could be extended to DMD boys. Twenty ambulant DMD boys aged 7 to <11 years on stable corticosteroid treatment were enrolled in the study and treated for ≥12 months with Givinostat. A muscle biopsy was collected at the beginning and at the end of treatment to evaluate the amount of muscle and fibrotic tissue. Histological effects were the primary objectives of the study. Treatment with Givinostat significantly increased the fraction of muscle tissue in the biopsies and reduced the amount of fibrotic tissue. It also substantially reduced tissue necrosis and fatty replacement. Overall the drug was safe and tolerated.

Recent advances in genome editing and gene therapy offer hope for the development of potential therapeutics. Truncated versions of the DMD gene can be delivered to the affected tissues with viral vectors and show promising results in a variety of animal models. Genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been used to restore dystrophin expression by deleting one or more exons of the DMD gene in patient cells and in a mouse model that led to functional improvement of muscle strength. Exon skipping with oligonucleotides has been successful in several animal models and evaluated in multiple clinical trials. Next-generation oligonucleotide formulations offer significant promise to build on these results. All these approaches to restoring dystrophin expression are encouraging, but many hurdles remain.

Imbalance between ROS/RNS production and elimination results in oxidative stress (OxS), which has been implicated in ageing and in numerous human diseases, including cancer, diabetes or age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia). The study of redox homeostasis in muscle was hindered by its lability, by the many factors influencing technical OxS measures and by ROS/RNS important roles in signaling pathways and adaptative responses to muscle contraction and effort, which make it difficult to define a threshold between physiological signaling and pathological conditions. In the last years, new tools have been developed that facilitate the study of these key mechanisms, and deregulation of redox homeostasis has emerged as a key pathogenic mechanism and potential therapeutic target in muscle conditions. This is in particular the case for early-onset myopathies, genetic muscle diseases which present from birth or early childhood with muscle weakness interfering with ambulation and often with cardiac or respiratory failure leading to premature death. Inherited defects of the reductase selenoprotein N in SEPN1-related myopathy leads to chronic OxS of monogenic origin as a primary disease pathomechanism. In myopathies associated with mutations of the genes encoding the calcium channel RyR1, the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI or the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), OxS has been identified as a relevant secondary pathophysiological mechanism. OxS being drug-targetable, it represents an interesting therapeutic target for these incurable conditions, and following preclinical correction of the cell or animal model phenotype, the first clinical trials with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (SEPN1- and RYR1-related myopathies) or epigallocatechin-gallate (DMD) have been launched recently. In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanisms involved in redox regulation in skeletal muscle, the technical tools available to measure redox homeostasis in muscle cells, the bases of OxS as a primary or secondary pathomechanism in early-onset myopathies and the innovative clinical trials with antioxidants which are currently in progress for these so-far untreatable infantile muscle diseases. Progress in our knowledge of redox homeostasis defects in these rare muscle conditions may be useful as a model paradigm to understand and treat other conditions in which OxS is involved, including prevalent conditions with major socioeconomic impact such as insulin resistance, cachexia, obesity, sarcopenia or ageing.",,,,2016-08-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
27524897,Current and emerging treatment strategies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, emerging treatment, review, standard of care",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in childhood. It is caused by mutations of the DMD gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature death due to cardiorespiratory complications. The diagnosis can usually be made after careful review of the history and examination of affected boys presenting with developmental delay, proximal weakness, and elevated serum creatine kinase, plus confirmation by muscle biopsy or genetic testing. Precise characterization of the DMD mutation is important for genetic counseling and individualized treatment. Current standard of care includes the use of corticosteroids to prolong ambulation and to delay the onset of secondary complications. Early use of cardioprotective agents, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and other supportive strategies has improved the life expectancy and health-related quality of life for many young adults with DMD. New emerging treatment includes viral-mediated microdystrophin gene replacement, exon skipping to restore the reading frame, and nonsense suppression therapy to allow translation and production of a modified dystrophin protein. Other potential therapeutic targets involve upregulation of compensatory proteins, reduction of the inflammatory cascade, and enhancement of muscle regeneration. So far, data from DMD clinical trials have shown limited success in delaying disease progression; unforeseen obstacles included immune response against the generated mini-dystrophin, inconsistent evidence of dystrophin production in muscle biopsies, and failure to demonstrate a significant improvement in the primary outcome measure, as defined by the 6-minute walk test in some studies. The long-term safety and efficacy of emerging treatments will depend on the selection of appropriate clinical end points and sensitive biomarkers to detect meaningful changes in disease progression. Correction of the underlying mutations using new gene-editing technologies and corticosteroid analogs with better safety profiles offers renewed hope for many individuals with DMD and their families.",,,,2016-08-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Results of ongoing preclinical and clinical trials suggest that partial restoration of dystrophin might be sufficient to significantly reduce muscle damage. Different myogenic progenitors are candidates for cell therapy of muscular dystrophies, but only satellite cells and pericytes have already entered clinical experimentation. This study aimed to provide in vitro quantitative evidence of the ability of mesoangioblasts to restore dystrophin, in terms of protein accumulation and distribution, within myotubes derived from DMD patients, using a microengineered model. We designed an ad hoc experimental strategy to miniaturize on a chip the standard process of muscle regeneration independent of variables such as inflammation and fibrosis. It is based on the coculture, at different ratios, of human dystrophin-positive myogenic progenitors and dystrophin-negative myoblasts in a substrate with muscle-like physiological stiffness and cell micropatterns. Results showed that both healthy myoblasts and mesoangioblasts restored dystrophin expression in DMD myotubes. However, mesoangioblasts showed unexpected efficiency with respect to myoblasts in dystrophin production in terms of the amount of protein produced (40% vs. 15%) and length of the dystrophin membrane domain (210-240 µm vs. 40-70 µm). These results show that our microscaled in vitro model of human DMD skeletal muscle validated previous in vivo preclinical work and may be used to predict efficacy of new methods aimed at enhancing dystrophin accumulation and distribution before they are tested in vivo, reducing time, costs, and variability of clinical experimentation.

27500011,Can Quantitative Muscle Strength and Functional Motor Ability Differentiate the Influence of Age and Corticosteroids in Ambulatory Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?,,PLoS currents,"In the absence of a curative treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), corticosteroid therapy (prednisone, deflazacort) has been adopted as the standard of care, as it slows the progression of muscle weakness and enables longer retention of functional mobility. The ongoing development of novel pharmacological agents that target the genetic defect underlying DMD offer hope for a significant alteration in disease progression; however, substantiation of therapeutic efficacy has proved challenging. Identifying functional outcomes sensitive to the early, subtle changes in muscle function has confounded clinical trials. Additionally, the alterations in disease progression secondary to corticosteroid therapy are not well described making it difficult to ascertain the benefits of novel agents, often taken concurrently with corticosteroids.
The purpose of this study was to examine outcome responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy and age at the onset of a natural history study of ambulatory boys with DMD.
Eighty-five ambulatory boys with DMD (mean age 93 mo, range 49 to 180 mo) were recruited into this study. Fifty participants were on corticosteroid therapy, while 33 were corticosteroid naïve at the baseline assessment. Within each treatment group boys were divided in two age groups, 4 to 7 years and 8 and greater years of age. The Biodex System 3 Pro isokinetic dynamometer was used to assess muscle strength. Motor skills were assessed using the upper two dimensions (standing/walking, running & jumping) of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM 88) and Timed Motor Tests (TMTs) (10-meter run, sit to stand, supine to stand, climb 4-stairs). Two way analysis of variance and Pearson correlations were used for analysis.
A main effect for age was seen in select lower extremity muscle groups (hip flexors, knee extensors and ankle dorsiflexors), standing dimension skills, and all TMTs with significantly greater weakness and loss of motor skill ability seen in the older age group regardless of treatment group. Interaction effects were seen for the walking, running, and jumping dimension of the GMFM with the naïve boys scoring higher in the younger group and boys on corticosteroid therapy scoring higher in the older group. The TMT of climb 4-stairs demonstrated a significant treatment effect with the boys on corticosteroid therapy climbing stairs faster than those who were naïve, regardless of age.

Despite broad research aiming to improve muscle function as well as heart and brain function, sufficient therapeutic efficacy has not yet been achieved and current therapeutic management is still supportive. In a recent pilot trial, oral treatment with L-arginine and metformin showed consistent changes of muscular metabolism both in vitro and in vivo by raising NO levels and expression of mitochondrial proteins in the skeletal muscle tissue of patients with DMD. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of L-citrulline and metformin therapy over placebo in DMD patients with regard to the Motor Function Measure (MFM) D1 subscore (primary endpoint) as well as additional clinical and subclinical tests.
A total of 40-50 ambulant patients with DMD will be recruited at the outpatient department of the University of Basel Children's Hospital (Switzerland), as well as from the DMD patient registries of Switzerland, Germany and Austria. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two arms of the study and will receive either a combination of L-citrulline and metformin or placebo for 26 weeks. Co-medication with glucocorticoids is allowed. The primary endpoint is the change of the MFM D1 subscore from baseline to week 26 under L-citrulline and metformin therapy. Secondary endpoints will include the motor function measure (MFM) and its items and subscores, the 6-minute walking test, timed function tests and quantitative muscle testing. Furthermore, quantitative muscle MRI assessment to evaluate the muscle fat fraction as well as safety and biomarker laboratory analyses from blood will be included. For comparison, muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function will be analysed in 10-20 healthy age-matched male children.
The aim of this study is to test if a 6-month treatment of a combination of L-citrulline and metformin is more effective than placebo in preventing loss of motor function and muscle degeneration in DMD. The MFM D1 subscore is used as a clinical outcome measure and a quantitative muscle MRI assessment as the surrogate outcome measure of fatty muscle degeneration.

This causes functional ischemia and contributes to muscle wasting. Similar functional ischemia may be present in brains of patients with BMD, who often have mild cognitive impairment, and nNOS may be important for the regulation of the microvascular circulation in the brain. We hypothesized that treatment with sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that potentiates nitric oxide responses, would augment both the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with BMD. Seventeen patients (mean ± SD age 38.5 ± 10.8 years) with BMD were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Twelve patients completed the entire study. Effects of sildenafil were assessed by 3 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanning, evoked potentials, somatosensory task-induced BOLD functional MR imaging, regional and global perfusion, and angiography before and after 4 weeks of sildenafil, 20 mg (Revatio in gelatine capsules, oral, 3 times daily), or placebo treatment. Sildenafil increased the event-related sensory and visual BOLD response compared with placebo (p < 0.01). However, sildenafil did not alter CBF, measured by MR phase contrast mapping, or the arterial diameter of the middle cerebral artery, measured by MR angiography. We conclude that nNOS may play a role in event-related neurovascular responses.

We assessed whether boys with DMD could be grouped into classes that shared similar ambulatory function trajectories as measured by 6MWD. Ambulatory boys aged 5 years or older with genetically confirmed DMD who were enrolled in a natural history study at 11 care centers throughout Italy were included. For each boy, standardized assessments of 6MWD were available at annual intervals spanning 3 years. Trajectories of 6MWD vs. age and trajectories of 6MWD vs. time from enrollment were examined using latent class analysis. A total of 96 boys were included. At enrollment, the mean age was 8.3 years (mean 6MWD: 374 meters). After accounting for age, baseline 6MWD, and steroid use, four latent trajectory classes were identified as explaining 3-year 6MWD outcomes significantly better than a single average trajectory. Patient trajectories of 6MWD change from enrollment were categorized as having fast decline (n = 25), moderate decline (n = 19), stable function (n = 37), and improving function (n = 15) during the 3-year follow-up. After accounting for trajectory classes, the standard deviation of variation in 6MWD was reduced by approximately 40%.

Therapeutic agents for the treatment of rare disease, namely ""orphan drugs"", have recently drawn the attention of researchers and pharmaceutical companies. To ensure the successful conduction of clinical trials to evaluate novel treatments for patients with rare diseases, an appropriate infrastructure is needed. One of the effective solutions for the lack of infrastructure is to establish a network of rare diseases.
To accomplish the conduction of clinical trials in Japan, the Muscular dystrophy clinical trial network (MDCTN) was established by the clinical research group for muscular dystrophy, including the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, as well as national and university hospitals, all which have a long-standing history of research cooperation.
Thirty-one medical institutions (17 national hospital organizations, 10 university hospitals, 1 national center, 2 public hospitals, and 1 private hospital) belong to this network and collaborate to facilitate clinical trials.

There is no curative therapy, although innovative therapeutic approaches have been aggressively investigated over recent years. Currently, the international clinical trial registry platform for this disease has been constructed and clinical trials for innovative therapeutic approaches are underway. Among these, exon skipping and read-through of nonsense mutations are in the most advanced stages, with exon skipping theoretically applicable to a larger number of patients. To date, exon skipping that targets exons 51, 44, 45, and 53 is being globally investigated including in USA, EU, and Japan. The latest announcement from Japan was made, demonstrating successful dystrophin production in muscles of patients with DMD after treating with exon 53 skipping antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). However, the innovative therapeutic approaches have demonstrated limited efficacy. To address this issue in exon skipping, studies to unveil the mechanism underlying gymnotic delivery of ASO uptake in living cells have been conducted in an effort to improve in vivo delivery. Further, establishing the infrastructures to integrate multi-institutional clinical trials are needed to facilitate the development of successful therapies for DMD, which ultimately is applicable to other myopathies and neurodegenerative diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and motor neuron diseases.",,,,2016-07-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
30010301,[Molecular therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy].,,No to hattatsu = Brain and development,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common inherited muscle disorder, which is characterized by progressive muscle wasting, ultimately resulting in the death of patients in their twenties or thirties. In DMD the dystrophin gene is mutated, which results in a deficiency of the muscle dystrophin. Although expression of dystrophin is a fundamental treatment for DMD, no effective treatment for DMD is available until now. Promising molecular therapies which are mutation-specific have been developed. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping that convert out-of-frame mRNA into in-frame mRNA, thereby enabling semifunctional dystrophin production, is recognized as the most promising treatment for DMD. We demonstrated that the intravenous administration of the antisense oligonucleotide against the splicing enhancer sequence induced exon skipping and produced the dystrophin protein in DMD case for the first time. After extensive studies, antisense oligonucleotides comprising different monomers have undergone clinical trials and provided favorable results, enabling improvements in ambulation of DMD patients Induction of the read-through of nonsense mutations is expected to produce dystrophin in DMD patients with nonsense mutations. The clinical effectiveness of gentamicxin and PTC124 has been reported. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of arbekacin-mediated read-through in vitro.

Splicing of pre-mRNA is required for the proper expression of the vast majority of protein-coding genes, and thus, targeting the process offers a means to manipulate protein production from a gene. Splicing modulation is particularly valuable in cases of disease caused by mutations that lead to disruption of normal splicing or when interfering with the normal splicing process of a gene transcript may be therapeutic. SSOs offer an effective and specific way to target and alter splicing in a therapeutic manner. Here, we discuss the different approaches used to target and alter pre-mRNA splicing with SSOs. We detail the modifications to the nucleic acids that make them promising therapeutics and discuss the challenges to creating effective SSO drugs.

Whereas antisense oligonucleotide-based clinical trials are underway for DMD, it is essential to determine the dystrophin restoration threshold needed to ensure improvement of muscle physiology at the molecular level. A preclinical trial has been conducted in golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs treated in a forelimb by locoregional delivery of rAAV8-U7snRNA to promote exon skipping on the canine dystrophin messenger. Here, we exploited rAAV8-U7snRNA-transduced GRMD muscle samples, well characterized for their percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers, with the aim of defining the threshold of dystrophin rescue necessary for normalization of the status of neuronal nitric oxide synthase mu (nNOSμ), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel type 1 (RyR1), crucial actors for efficient contractile function. Results showed that restoration of dystrophin in 40% of muscle fibers is needed to decrease abnormal cytosolic nNOSμ expression and to reduce overexpression of iNOS, these two parameters leading to a reduction in the NO level in the muscle fibers. Furthermore, the same percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers of 40% was associated with the normalization of RyR1 nitrosylation status and with stabilization of the RyR1-calstabin1 complex that is required to facilitate coupled gating. We concluded that a minimal threshold of 40% of dystrophin-positive fibers is necessary for the reinstatement of central proteins needed for proper muscle contractile function, and thus identified a rate of dystrophin expression significantly improving, at the molecular level, the dystrophic muscle physiology.",,,,2016-06-10,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

ActiMyo® is an innovative device that uses magneto-inertial sensors to record angular velocities and linear accelerations that can be used over long periods of time in the home environment. The device was designed to insure long-term stability and good signal to noise ratio, even for very weak movements. In order to determine relevant and pertinent clinical variables with potential for use as outcome measures in clinical trials or to guide therapy decisions, we performed a pilot study in non-ambulant neuromuscular patients. We report here data from seven Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients (mean age 18.5 ± 5.5 years) collected in a clinical setting. Patients were assessed while wearing the device during performance of validated tasks (MoviPlate, Box and Block test and Minnesota test) and tasks mimicking daily living. The ActiMyo® sensors were placed on the wrists during all the tests. Software designed for use with the device computed several variables to qualify and quantify muscular activity in the non-ambulant subjects. Four variables representative of upper limb activity were studied: the rotation rate, the ratio of the vertical component in the overall acceleration, the hand elevation rate, and an estimate of the power of the upper limb. The correlations between clinical data and physical activity and the ActiMyo® movement parameters were analyzed. The mean of the rotation rate and mean of the elevation rate appeared promising since these variables had the best reliability scores and correlations with task scores. Parameters could be computed even in a patient with a Brooke functional score of 6. The variables chosen are good candidates as potential outcome measures in non-ambulant patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and use of the ActiMyo® is currently being explored in home environment.

The success of randomized clinical trials for novel therapeutics depends on outcome measurements that are sensitive to change. As the development of motor skills may lead to functional improvements in young boys with DMD, their inclusion may potentially confound clinical trials. Three-dimensional gait analysis is an under-utilized approach that can quantify joint moments and powers, which reflect functional muscle strength. In this study, gait kinetics, kinematics, spatial-temporal parameters, and timed functional tests were quantified over a one-year period for 21 boys between 4 and 8 years old who were enrolled in a multisite natural history study. At baseline, hip moments and powers were inadequate. Between the two visits, 12 boys began a corticosteroid regimen (mean duration 10.8±2.4 months) while 9 boys remained steroid-naïve. Significant between-group differences favoring steroid use were found for primary kinetic outcomes (peak hip extensor moments (p=.007), duration of hip extensor moments (p=.007), peak hip power generation (p=.028)), and spatial-temporal parameters (walking speed (p=.016) and cadence (p=.021)). Significant between-group differences were not found for kinematics or timed functional tests with the exception of the 10m walk test (p=.03), which improves in typically developing children within this age range. These results indicate that hip joint kinetics can be used to identify weakness in young boys with DMD and are sensitive to corticosteroid intervention.

Dystrophin gene mutations are generally transmitted from the mother to male offspring and can occur throughout the coding length of the gene. The majority of the methodologies aimed at treating the disorder have focused on restoring a shorter, although partially functional, dystrophin protein. The approach has the potential of converting a severe DMD phenotype into a milder form of the disease known as Becker muscular dystrophy. Others have focused on ameliorating the disease by targeting secondary pathologies such as inflammation or loss of regeneration. Of great potential is the development of strategies that are capable of restoring full-length dystrophin expression due to their ability to produce a normal, fully functional protein. Among these strategies, the use of read-through compounds (RTCs) that could be administered orally represents an ideal option. Gentamicin has been previously tested in clinical trials for DMD with limited or no success, and its use in the clinic has been dismissed due to issues of toxicity and lack of clear benefits to patients. More recently, new RTCs have been identified and tested in animal models for DMD. This review will focus on one of those RTCs known as ataluren that has now completed Phase III clinical studies for DMD and at providing an overview of the different stages that have led to its clinical development for the disease. The impact that this new drug may have on DMD and its future perspectives will also be described, with an emphasis on the importance of further assessing the clinical benefits of this molecule in patients as it becomes available on the market in different countries.",,,,2016-05-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
27149418,Corticosteroids for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. Untreated, this incurable disease, which has an X-linked recessive inheritance, is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability, leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is a major aim of treatment. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that corticosteroids significantly improve muscle strength and function in boys with DMD in the short term (six months), and strength at two years (two-year data on function are very limited). Corticosteroids, now part of care recommendations for DMD, are largely in routine use, although questions remain over their ability to prolong walking, when to start treatment, longer-term balance of benefits versus harms, and choice of corticosteroid or regimen.We have extended the scope of this updated review to include comparisons of different corticosteroids and dosing regimens.
To assess the effects of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking ability, muscle strength, functional ability, and quality of life in DMD; to address the question of whether benefit is maintained over the longer term (more than two years); to assess adverse events; and to compare efficacy and adverse effects of different corticosteroid preparations and regimens.
On 16 February 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and LILACS. We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts. We checked references in identified trials, handsearched journal abstracts, and searched trials registries.
We considered RCTs or quasi-RCTs of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, and deflazacort) given for a minimum of three months to patients with a definite DMD diagnosis. We considered comparisons of different corticosteroids, regimens, and corticosteroids versus placebo.
The review authors followed standard Cochrane methodology.
We identified 12 studies (667 participants) and two new ongoing studies for inclusion. Six RCTs were newly included at this update and important non-randomised cohort studies have also been published. Some important studies remain unpublished and not all published studies provide complete outcome data.
one two-year deflazacort RCT (n = 28) used prolongation of ambulation as an outcome measure but data were not adequate for drawing conclusions.
meta-analyses showed that corticosteroids (0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone or prednisolone) improved muscle strength and function versus placebo over six months (moderate quality evidence from up to four RCTs). Evidence from single trials showed 0.75 mg/kg/day superior to 0.3 mg/kg/day on most strength and function measures, with little evidence of further benefit at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), timed walk, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade, and forced vital capacity. One new RCT (n = 66), reported better strength, function and quality of life with daily 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone at 12 months. One RCT (n = 28) showed that deflazacort stabilised muscle strength versus placebo at two years, but timed function test results were too imprecise for conclusions to be drawn.One double-blind RCT (n = 64), largely at low risk of bias, compared daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) with weekend-only prednisone (5 mg/kg/weekend day), finding no overall difference in muscle strength and function over 12 months (moderate to low quality evidence). Two small RCTs (n = 52) compared daily prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day with daily deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, but study methods limited our ability to compare muscle strength or function.
excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hair growth were all previously shown to be more common with corticosteroids than placebo; we assessed the quality of evidence (for behavioural changes and weight gain) as moderate. Hair growth and cushingoid features were more frequent at 0.75 mg/kg/day than 0.3 mg/kg/day prednisone. Comparing daily versus weekend-only prednisone, both groups gained weight with no clear difference in body mass index (BMI) or in behavioural changes (low quality evidence for both outcomes, one study); the weekend-only group had a greater linear increase in height. Very low quality evidence suggested less weight gain with deflazacort than with prednisone at 12 months, and no difference in behavioural abnormalities. Data are insufficient to assess the risk of fractures or cataracts for any comparison.Non-randomised studies support RCT evidence in showing improved functional benefit from corticosteroids. These studies suggest sustained benefit for up to 66 months. Adverse effects were common, although generally manageable. According to a large comparative longitudinal study of daily or intermittent (10 days on, 10 days off) corticosteroid for a mean period of four years, a daily regimen prolongs ambulation and improves functional scores over the age of seven, but with a greater frequency of side effects than an intermittent regimen.
Moderate quality evidence from RCTs indicates that corticosteroid therapy in DMD improves muscle strength and function in the short term (twelve months), and strength up to two years. On the basis of the evidence available for strength and function outcomes, our confidence in the effect estimate for the efficacy of a 0.75 mg/kg/day dose of prednisone or above is fairly secure. There is no evidence other than from non-randomised trials to establish the effect of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common with corticosteroids than placebo, but not clinically severe. A weekend-only prednisone regimen is as effective as daily prednisone in the short term (12 months), according to low to moderate quality evidence from a single trial, with no clear difference in BMI (low quality evidence). Very low quality evidence indicates that deflazacort causes less weight gain than prednisone after a year's treatment. We cannot evaluate long-term benefits and hazards of corticosteroid treatment or intermittent regimens from published RCTs. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits, but also identify clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment, and a possible divergence of efficacy in daily and weekend-only regimens in the longer term. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research and clinical practice.",,,,2016-05-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, its biomechanical effects on gait are unclear. This study assessed the effects of daytime and night-time use of Articulated Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) on kinematic, kinetic and spatial/temporal gait parameters of DMD patients.
Twenty ambulatory patients (4-12years of age) were assigned to one of three groups: no orthosis (NoO; n=7), night-time orthosis (NiO; n=7), day-time orthosis (DO; n=6). All subjects were evaluated once (Ev1) and five of them were re-evaluated between five and seven months after Ev1 (Ev2).
Cross-sectional analysis with linear mixed-effects models (ANOVA) showed increased peak dorsiflexion angle and dorsiflexor moment and decreased plantar flexion angle and ankle joint power generation for the DOwith group when compared to the NoO group (P<0.05). The DOwith group also showed decreased peak hip flexion angle, hip power absorption, plantar flexion angle and increased peak dorsiflexion moment when compared to the NoO group (P<0.05). Analysis of gait cycle curves showed significant and clinically relevant changes in kinematic and kinetic parameters for the DOwith group when compared to the other experimental groups. Longitudinal analysis suggest that night-time use of Articulated AFO can promote positive changes in gait parameters of DMD patients, when used before the functional deficit is too advanced.
Early daytime and night-time use of Articulated AFO changed gait and minimized typical compensations seen in DMD patients, thus it is recommended in order to prolong gait ability.",,,,2016-05-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
27136712,Engaging Participants in Rare Disease Research: A Qualitative Study of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, clinical trials, family engagement, recruitment",Clinical therapeutics,"Clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are increasing due to technical advances in genetics, muscle biology and muscle imaging, and translational science. Yet the ability to achieve and measure progress in clinical trials in DMD is severely constrained by recruitment difficulties and low levels of patient and family participation. Clinical trials that do not have full inclusion of patients may affect how well new therapies perform in clinical practice.
This study qualitatively investigated family-centered and clinician-based knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of engagement in clinical research in DMD. Thirteen focus-group sessions (8 parent based and 5 clinician based) were held at 5 demographically and geographically diverse sites (Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Sacramento, California; and Washington, DC). Thematic analysis was used for identifying patterns of meaning across the dataset.
Totals of 28 parents and 33 clinicians participated in innovative and thoughtful discussions regarding clinical research in DMD and approaches to eliciting family engagement. Five overarching themes emerged from our qualitative data. The theme of Information discussed the lack of accessible and coherent information, as well as the overabundance of fragmented information. The theme of Conversation demonstrated the importance of having open and in-depth dialogue about research with families in eliciting trust and obligation toward the research process. The Barriers and Incentives themes presented the parents' and clinicians' views of the life-altering sacrifices that families make to participate in research and ways to reduce these burdens. Under the Solutions theme, parents and clinicians also suggested innovative ways to incentivize families and clinics and thoughtful solutions to increase family engagement in research.
Effective recruitment for clinical studies in rare diseases requires a truly committed and engaged study team, as well as the necessary resources to overcome the multitude of barriers that families face. A clearly delineated recruitment plan, developed together with families, should be the standard operating procedure during clinical trial development. Protocols utilizing direct family-centered strategies for providing information and for recruiting research participants in studies in rare diseases are essential.",,,,2016-05-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

26974331,Correlation of Utrophin Levels with the Dystrophin Protein Complex and Muscle Fibre Regeneration in Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy Muscle Biopsies.,,PloS one,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe and currently incurable progressive neuromuscular condition, caused by mutations in the DMD gene that result in the inability to produce dystrophin. Lack of dystrophin leads to loss of muscle fibres and a reduction in muscle mass and function. There is evidence from dystrophin-deficient mouse models that increasing levels of utrophin at the muscle fibre sarcolemma by genetic or pharmacological means significantly reduces the muscular dystrophy pathology. In order to determine the efficacy of utrophin modulators in clinical trials, it is necessary to accurately measure utrophin levels and other biomarkers on a fibre by fibre basis within a biopsy section. Our aim was to develop robust and reproducible staining and imaging protocols to quantify sarcolemmal utrophin levels, sarcolemmal dystrophin complex members and numbers of regenerating fibres within a biopsy section. We quantified sarcolemmal utrophin in mature and regenerating fibres and the percentage of regenerating muscle fibres, in muscle biopsies from Duchenne, the milder Becker muscular dystrophy and controls. Fluorescent immunostaining followed by image analysis was performed to quantify utrophin intensity and β-dystrogylcan and ɣ -sarcoglycan intensity at the sarcolemma. Antibodies to fetal and developmental myosins were used to identify regenerating muscle fibres allowing the accurate calculation of percentage regeneration fibres in the biopsy. Our results indicate that muscle biopsies from Becker muscular dystrophy patients have fewer numbers of regenerating fibres and reduced utrophin intensity compared to muscle biopsies from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Of particular interest, we show for the first time that the percentage of regenerating muscle fibres within the muscle biopsy correlate with the clinical severity of Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients from whom the biopsy was taken. The ongoing development of these tools to quantify sarcolemmal utrophin and muscle regeneration in muscle biopsies will be invaluable for assessing utrophin modulator activity in future clinical trials.",,,,2016-03-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The Japanese journal of clinical pathology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of inherited muscle disease and is characterized by progressive muscle wasting, ultimately resulting in the death of patients in their twenties or thirties. DMD is characterized by a deficiency of the muscle dystrophin as a result of mutations in the dystrophin gene. Currently, no effective treatment for DMD is available. Promising molecular therapies which are mutation-specific have been developed. Transformation of an out-of-frame mRNA into an in-frame dystrophin message by inducing exon skipping is considered one of the approaches most likely to lead to success. We demonstrated that the intravenous administration of the antisense oligonucleotide against the splicing enhancer sequence results in exon skipping and production of the dystrophin protein in DMD case for the first time. After extensive studies, anti-sense oligonucleotides comprising different monomers have undergone clinical trials and provided favorable results, enabling improvements in ambulation of DMD patients. Induction of the read-through of nonsense mutations is expected to produce dystrophin in DMD patients with nonsense mutations, which are detected in 19% of DMD cases. The clinical effectiveness of gentamicin and PTC124 has been reported. We have demonstrated that arbekacin-mediated read-through can markedly ameliorate muscular dystrophy in vitro.

The study tested if increased intramuscular nitric oxide concentration can improve mitochondrial energy metabolism in Duchenne muscular dystrophy using a novel therapeutic approach through the combination of L-arginine with metformin. Five ambulatory, genetically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients aged between 7–10 years were treated with L-arginine (3 x 2.5 g/d) and metformin (2 x 250 mg/d) for 16 weeks. Treatment effects were assessed using mitochondrial protein expression analysis in muscular biopsies, indirect calorimetry, Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry, quantitative thigh muscle MRI, and clinical scores of muscle performance. There were no serious side effects and no patient dropped out. Muscle biopsy results showed pre-treatment a significantly reduced mitochondrial protein expression and increased oxidative stress in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients compared to controls. Post-treatment a significant elevation of proteins of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was observed as well as a reduction in oxidative stress. Treatment also decreased resting energy expenditure rates and energy substrate use shifted from carbohydrates to fatty acids. These changes were associated with improved clinical scores. In conclusion pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway leads to improved mitochondria function and clinically a slowing of disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This study shall lead to further development of this novel therapeutic approach into a real alternative for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.

Disease-specific therapies are needed that can be initiated before irreversible myocardial damage ensues. In order to evaluate therapeutic efficacy, surrogate endpoints other than ejection fraction must be found. The hypothesis of this study is that T1 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) mapping using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can detect diffuse extracellular matrix expansion in DMD patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and without myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).
Thirty-one DMD and 11 healthy control participants were prospectively enrolled. CMR using a modified Look-Locker (MOLLI) sequence was performed in all participants before and after contrast administration. T1 and ECV maps of the mid left ventricular myocardium were generated and regions of interest were contoured using the standard 6-segment AHA model. Global and segmental values were compared between DMD and controls using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Over the past 30 years, increasingly better standards of care have considerably improved the quality of life as well as the life expectancy of DMD patients. Despite such progress in disease management, DMD remains a devastating disorder with continuous decline of motor and cardiac function. Until recently, corticosteroids were the only treatment available to slow down, however modestly, disease progression. Importantly, novel innovative therapeutic approaches are currently being developed. This review discusses the rational and underlying molecular mechanism of these novel strategies as well as the progress made by recent clinical trials.

26773583,[Genetics and molecular aspects of dystrophinopathies].,,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are caused by mutations in the DMD gene that encodes the cytoskeletal protein, dystrophin. Dystrophinopathies are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Due to the tremendous size of the gene (2.2 megabases), the DMD locus has a high spontaneous mutation rate, and one third of sporadic cases of DMD are due to a de novo mutation. There are seven tissue-specific promoters in the gene. The skeletal muscular transcript contains 79 exons and encode the full-length protein (427-kDa) located at the inner face of the sarcolemma of muscle fibers. DMD gene mutations are highly heterogeneous. Large rearrangements (deletions or duplications of one or more exons) are most frequently involved while point mutations account for 20 %-30 % of cases. A survey of current strategies of molecular diagnosis is presented here. In particular, the role of muscle biopsy (for dystrophin and RNA analyses) in the diagnosis of dystrophinopathies is discussed. In more than 90 % of cases, the clinical severity is correlated with the impact of the mutations on the reading frame and the expression of the dystrophin (absence or residual amount of mutated protein). Various mechanisms contribute to the exceptions. Besides the clinical interest for the patient, the identification of the mutation allows accurate genetic counseling in the familles, and is a necessary prerequisite for the inclusion of the patient in the genotype-based clinical trials.",,,,2016-01-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), connective fibrotic tissue progressively substitutes muscle fibers. So far no specific pharmacological treatment is available for muscle fibrosis. Among promising anti-fibrotic molecules, pirfenidone has shown anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in animal and cell models, and has already been employed in clinical trials. Therefore we tested pirfenidone anti-fibrotic properties in an in vitro model of muscle fibrosis.
We evaluated effect of pirfenidone on fibroblasts isolated from DMD muscle biopsies. These cells have been previously characterized as having a pro-fibrotic phenotype. We tested cell proliferation and migration, secretion of soluble collagens, intracellular levels of collagen type I and fibronectin, and diameter of 3D fibrotic nodules.
We found that pirfenidone significantly reduced proliferation and cell migration of control and DMD muscle-derived fibroblasts, decreased extracellular secretion of soluble collagens by control and DMD fibroblasts, as well as levels of collagen type I and fibronectin, and, in DMD fibroblasts only, reduced synthesis and deposition of intracellular collagen. Furthermore, pirfenidone was able to reduce the diameter of fibrotic-nodules in our 3D model of in vitro fibrosis.
These pre-clinical results indicate that pirfenidone has potential anti-fibrotic effects also in skeletal muscle fibrosis, urging further studies in in vivo animal models of muscular dystrophy in order to translate the drug into the treatment of muscle fibrosis in DMD patients.",,,,2015-12-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The immune inflammatory response also contributes to disease progression in DMD patients. In a previous study, we demonstrated higher levels of circulating CD49dhi and CD49ehi T cells in DMD patients compared to healthy control. DMD patients are clinically heterogeneous and the functional defect cannot be correlated with genotype. Therefore, it is important to be able to define reliable noninvasive biomarkers to better define the disease progression at the beginning of clinical trials.
We studied 75 DMD patients at different stages of their disease and observed that increased percentages of circulating CD4(+)CD49d(hi) and CD8(+)CD49d(hi) T lymphocytes were correlated with both severity and a more rapid progression of the disease. Moreover, T(+)CD49d(+) cells were also found in muscular inflammatory infiltrates. Functionally, T cells from severely affected patients exhibited higher transendothelial and fibronectin-driven migratory responses and increased adhesion to myotubes, when compared to control individuals. These responses could be blocked with an anti-CD49d monoclonal antibody.

Treatment with Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) lead to shorter de novo dystrophin protein in both animal models and DMD boys who otherwise lack dystrophin; however, restoration of dystrophin has been observed to be highly variable. Understanding the factors causing highly variable induction of dystrophin expression in pre-clinical models would likely lead to more effective means of exon skipping in both pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials.
In the present study, we investigated possible factors that might lead to the variable success of exon skipping using morpholino drugs in the mdx mouse model. We tested whether specific muscle groups or fiber types showed better success than others and also correlated residual PMO concentration in muscle with the amount of de novo dystrophin protein 1 month after a single high-dose morpholino injection (800 mg/kg). We compared the results from six muscle groups using three different methods of dystrophin quantification: immunostaining, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry assays.
The triceps muscle showed the greatest degree of rescue (average 38±28 % by immunostaining). All three dystrophin detection methods were generally concordant for all muscles. We show that dystrophin rescue occurs in a sporadic patchy pattern with high geographic variability across muscle sections. We did not find a correlation between residual morpholino drug in muscle tissue and the degree of dystrophin expression.
While we found some evidence of muscle group enhancement and successful rescue, our data also suggest that other yet-undefined factors may underlie the observed variability in the success of exon skipping.

Identification of novel protein biomarkers has been limited due to the massive complexity of the serum proteome and the presence of a small number of very highly abundant proteins. Here we have utilised an aptamer-based proteomics approach to profile 1,129 proteins in the serum of wild-type and mdx (dystrophin deficient) mice. The serum levels of 96 proteins were found to be significantly altered (P < 0.001, q < 0.01) in mdx mice. Additionally, systemic treatment with a peptide-antisense oligonucleotide conjugate designed to induce Dmd exon skipping and recover dystrophin protein expression caused many of the differentially abundant serum proteins to be restored towards wild-type levels. Results for five leading candidate protein biomarkers (Pgam1, Tnni3, Camk2b, Cycs and Adamts5) were validated by ELISA in the mouse samples.

Three-year progression of eteplirsen-treated patients was compared to matched historical controls (HC).
Ambulatory DMD patients who were ≥7 years old and amenable to exon 51 skipping were randomized to eteplirsen (30/50mg/kg) or placebo for 24 weeks. Thereafter, all received eteplirsen on an open-label basis. The primary functional assessment in this study was the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Respiratory muscle function was assessed by pulmonary function testing (PFT). Longitudinal natural history data were used for comparative analysis of 6MWT performance at baseline and months 12, 24, and 36. Patients were matched to the eteplirsen group based on age, corticosteroid use, and genotype.
At 36 months, eteplirsen-treated patients (n = 12) demonstrated a statistically significant advantage of 151m (p < 0.01) on 6MWT and experienced a lower incidence of loss of ambulation in comparison to matched HC (n = 13) amenable to exon 51 skipping. PFT results remained relatively stable in eteplirsen-treated patients. Eteplirsen was well tolerated. Analysis of HC confirmed the previously observed change in disease trajectory at age 7 years, and more severe progression was observed in patients with mutations amenable to exon skipping than in those not amenable.

In this article, the benefits of genetically engineered pigs for basic and translational research are exemplified by a novel pig model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and by porcine models of cystic fibrosis. Particular emphasis is given to potential advantages of using these models for efficacy and safety testing of targeted therapies, such as exon skipping and gene editing, for example, using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated system.

A number of recent advances have spurred renewed optimism toward initiating clinical trials and developing refined therapies for the muscular dystrophies (MD's) and other myogenic disorders. MD's encompass a heterogeneous group of degenerative disorders often characterized by progressive muscle weakness and fragility. Many of these diseases result from mutations in genes encoding proteins of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). The most common and severe form among children is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, with an average life expectancy around 25 years of age. Another group of MD's referred to as the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) can affect boys or girls, with different types caused by mutations in different genes. Mutation of the α-sarcoglycan gene, also a DGC component, causes LGMD2D and represents the most common form of LGMD. Early preclinical and clinical trial findings support the feasibility of gene therapy via recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors as a viable treatment approach for many MDs.

However, it is not known whether air stacking is more effective via a resuscitator bag or a home ventilator.
This prospective randomized study investigated the effect of air stacking via a volume-cycled home ventilator versus via a resuscitator bag in participants with DMD. Maximum insufflation capacity and peak expiratory flow during spontaneous (cough peak flow) and air stacking-assisted cough maneuvers (air stacking-assisted cough peak flow) were measured.
Fifty-two adult DMD subjects receiving noninvasive ventilation were included in the study: 27 participants performed air stacking via their home ventilator (home-ventilator group; age = 25.3 ± 5.1 y; forced vital capacity (FVC) = 809 ± 555 mL), and 25 participants used a resuscitator bag (resuscitator-bag group; age = 24.7 ± 5.7 y, FVC = 807 ± 495 mL). Following a single training session, air stacking could be performed successfully by 89% (home ventilator) and 88% (resuscitator bag) of participants. There were comparable maximum insufflation capacities (1,481 mL for the home-ventilator group vs 1,344 mL for the resuscitator-bag group, P = .33) and mean air stacking-assisted cough peak flow values (199 L/min for the home-ventilator group vs 186 L/min for the resuscitator-bag group, P = .33) between techniques. Air stacking-assisted cough peak flow increased significantly compared with baseline in both groups (mean increase: +51% [home ventilator] vs +49% [resuscitator bag], P < .001), with individual air stacking-assisted cough peak flow improvements ranging from -20 to 245%.

26437761,Sodium nitrate alleviates functional muscle ischaemia in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy.,,The Journal of physiology,"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a progressive X-linked muscle wasting disease for which there is no treatment. BMD is caused by in-frame mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a structural cytoskeletal protein that also targets other proteins to the sarcolemma. Among these is neuronal nitric oxide synthase mu (nNOSμ), which requires specific spectrin-like repeats (SR16/17) in dystrophin's rod domain and the adaptor protein α-syntrophin for sarcolemmal targeting. When healthy skeletal muscle is exercised, sarcolemmal nNOSμ-derived nitric oxide (NO) attenuates α-adrenergic vasoconstriction, thus optimizing perfusion. In the mdx mouse model of dystrophinopathy, this protective mechanism (functional sympatholysis) is defective, resulting in functional muscle ischaemia. Treatment with a NO-donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) alleviates this ischaemia and improves the murine dystrophic phenotype. In the present study, we report that, in 13 men with BMD, sympatholysis is defective mainly in patients whose mutations disrupt sarcolemmal targeting of nNOSμ, with the vasoconstrictor response measured as a decrease in muscle oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy) to reflex sympathetic activation. Then, in a single-arm, open-label trial in 11 BMD patients and a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial in six patients, we show that acute treatment with oral sodium nitrate, an inorganic NO donor without a NSIAD moiety, restores sympatholysis and improves post-exercise hyperaemia (Doppler ultrasound).

Over the last decade, significant progress has been made utilizing gene augmentation therapy for a few genetic subtypes of IRD, although several technical challenges so far prevent a broad clinical application of this approach for other forms of IRD. Many of the mutations leading to these retinal diseases affect pre-mRNA splicing of the mutated genes . Antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-mediated splice modulation appears to be a powerful approach to correct the consequences of such mutations at the pre-mRNA level , as demonstrated by promising results in clinical trials for several inherited disorders like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hypercholesterolemia and various types of cancer. In this mini-review, we summarize ongoing pre-clinical research on AON-based therapy for a few genetic subtypes of IRD , speculate on other potential therapeutic targets, and discuss the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead to translate splice modulation therapy for retinal disorders to the clinic.",,,,2015-10-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

26423318,Surgery for scoliosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is usually progressive and is treated with surgery. However, it is unclear whether the existing evidence is sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support a recommendation for spinal surgery for most patients with DMD and scoliosis. This is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new studies were found for inclusion.
To determine the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery in patients with DMD with scoliosis. We intended to test whether spinal surgery is effective in increasing survival and improving respiratory function, quality of life, and overall functioning, and whether spinal surgery is associated with severe adverse effects.
On 16 June 2015 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus. We also searched ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis database (January 1980 to June 2015), the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Database (6 January 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (17 June 2015), and checked references. We imposed no language restrictions.
We planned to include controlled clinical trials using random or quasi-random allocation of treatment evaluating all forms of spinal surgery for scoliosis in patients with DMD in the review. The control interventions would have been no treatment, non-operative treatment, or a different form of spinal surgery.
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently examined the search results and evaluated the study characteristics against inclusion criteria in order to decide which studies to include in the review.
Of the 49 relevant studies we found, none met the inclusion criteria for the review because they were not clinical trials, but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series.
Since no randomized controlled clinical trials were available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with DMD, we can make no good evidence-based conclusion to guide clinical practice. Patients with scoliosis should be informed as to the uncertainty of benefits and potential risks of surgery for scoliosis. Randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery, in terms of quality of life, functional status, respiratory function, and life expectancy.",,,,2015-10-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A range of mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin lead to a severe muscular dystrophy known as Duchenne (DMD) or a typically milder form known as Becker (BMD). Patients with nonsense mutations in dystrophin are specifically targeted by stop codon read-through drugs, whereas out-of-frame deletions and insertions are targeted by exon-skipping therapies. Both treatment strategies are currently in clinical trials. Dystrophin missense mutations, however, cause a wide range of phenotypic severity in patients. The molecular and cellular consequences of such mutations are not well understood, and there are no therapies specifically targeting this genotype. Here, we have modeled two representative missense mutations, L54R and L172H, causing DMD and BMD, respectively, in full-length dystrophin. In vitro, the mutation associated with the mild phenotype (L172H) caused a minor decrease in tertiary stability, whereas the L54R mutation associated with a severe phenotype had a more dramatic effect. When stably expressed in mammalian muscle cells, the mutations caused steady-state decreases in dystrophin protein levels inversely proportional to the tertiary stability and directly caused by proteasomal degradation. Both proteasome inhibitors and heat shock activators were able to increase mutant dystrophin to WT levels, establishing the new cell lines as a platform to screen for potential therapeutics personalized to patients with destabilized dystrophin.",,,,2015-09-24,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Clinical trials and natural history studies are difficult for rare diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Using an online patient self-report survey model, Duchenne Connect provides relevant data that are difficult to gather in other ways. Validation of the overall dataset is supported by comparable mutational spectrum relative to other cohorts and demonstrated beneficial effect of corticosteroid use in prolonging ambulation. These types of analyses are provocative and allow multivariate analyses across the breadth of patient and physician medication and supplement practices. Because the data are self-reported and online, the barrier to participation is low and great potential exists for novel directions of further research in a highly participatory forum.
Patient registries for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) are powerful tools for monitoring patient outcomes, comparing treatment options, and relating information between patients, researchers, and clinicians. Duchenne Connect is an online patient self-report registry for individuals with DBMD that facilitates aggregation of treatment modalities, outcomes, and genotype data and has played a vital role in furthering DBMD research, particularly in the USA, in a highly participatory and low-cost manner.",,,,2015-09-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Prednisolone has recently been approved for pharmaceutical use in DMD patients in Japan. Moreover, the domestic guidelines for DMD have been published, which may lead to an increase in the use of steroid therapy. The short-term effects of steroid therapy for improving motor function have already been confirmed. Subsequently, the long-term effects of steroid therapy, such as prolonging the time until loss of walking ability, delay of scoliosis, and preservation of cardio-pulmonary function, have also been recognized. However, the long-term side-effects, such as obesity and bone demineralization, remain a concern.

Antisense oligonucleotides that induce skipping of exon 51, 44, 45, or 53 are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. These trials were designed on the basis of data available in general DMD population.
Our objective was to compare the clinical and functional statuses of non-ambulant DMD patients theoretically treatable by exon 53 skipping and of DMD patients with other mutations.
We first compared fifteen non-ambulant DMD patients carrying deletions theoretically treatable by exon 53 skipping (DMD-53) with fifteen closely age-matched DMD patients with mutations not treatable by exon 53 skipping (DMD-all-non-53) then with fifteen DMD patients carrying deletions not treatable by exon 53 skipping (DMD-del-non-53).
We found that DMD-53 patients had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more contractures and they tend to have weaker grips and pinch strengths than other DMD patients. DMD-53 patients lost ambulation significantly younger than other DMD patients. This result was confirmed by comparing ages at loss of ambulation in all non-ambulant DMD patients of the DMD cohort identified in a molecular diagnostic lab.

We studied 340 participants in the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS). LoA was defined as continuous wheelchair use. Effects of prednisone or prednisolone (PRED)/deflazacort (DFZ), administration frequency, and dose were analyzed by time-varying Cox regression. Side-effect frequencies were compared using χ(2) test.
Participants treated ≥1 year while ambulatory (n = 252/340) showed a 3-year median delay in LoA (p < 0.001). Fourteen different regimens were observed. Nondaily treatment was common for PRED (37%) and rare for DFZ (3%). DFZ was associated with later LoA than PRED (hazard ratio 0.294 ± 0.053 vs 0.490 ± 0.08, p = 0.003; 2-year difference in median LoA with daily administration, p < 0.001). Average dose was lower for daily PRED (0.56 mg/kg/d, 75% of recommended) than daily DFZ (0.75 mg/kg/d, 83% of recommended, p < 0.001). DFZ showed higher frequencies of growth delay (p < 0.001), cushingoid appearance (p = 0.002), and cataracts (p < 0.001), but not weight gain.
Use of DFZ was associated with later LoA and increased frequency of side effects. Differences in standards of care and dosing complicate interpretation of this finding, but stratification by PRED/DFZ might be considered in clinical trials. This study emphasizes the necessity of a randomized, blinded trial of GC regimens in DMD.

26306629,Improving clinical trial design for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,BMC neurology,"Currently, the most promising therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are exon skipping and stop codon read-through, two strategies aimed at restoring the expression of dystrophin. A phase 3 clinical trial with drisapersen, a drug designed to induce exon 51-skipping, has failed to show significant improvement of the primary outcome measure, the six-minute walk test.
Here, we review some key points that should be considered when designing clinical trials for these new therapies. First, younger patients have more functional abilities and more muscle fibers to preserve than older patients and therefore are better subjects for trials designed to demonstrate the success of new treatments. Second, the inclusion of patients on corticosteroids both in the treatment and placebo groups is of concern because the positive effect of corticosteroids might mask the effect of the treatment being tested. Additionally, the reasonable expectation from these therapies is the slowing of disease progression rather than improvement. Therefore, the appropriate clinical endpoints are the prolongation of the ability to stand from the floor, climb stairs, and walk, not an increase in muscle strength or function. Hence, the time frames for the detection of new dystrophin, which occurs within months, and the ability to demonstrate a slowing of disease progression, which requires years, are strikingly different. Finally, placebo-controlled trials are difficult to manage if years of blindness are required to demonstrate a slowing of disease progression. Thus, accelerated/conditional approval for new therapies should be based on surrogate biochemical outcomes: the demonstration of de novo dystrophin production and of its beneficial effect on the functional recovery of muscle fiber. These data suggest that clinical trials for DMD patients must be adapted to the particular characteristics of the disease in order to demonstrate the expected positive effect of new treatments.",,,,2015-08-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

26263473,Modifier genes and their effect on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Current opinion in neurology,"Recently, genetic pathways that modify the clinical severity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have been identified. The pathways uncovered as modifiers are useful to predict prognosis and also elucidate molecular signatures that can be manipulated therapeutically.
Modifiers have been identified using combinations of transcriptome and genome profiling. Osteopontin, encoded by the SPP1 gene, was found using gene expression profiling. Latent TGFβ binding protein 4, encoding latent TGFβ binding protein 4 was initially discovered using a genome-wide screen in mice and then validated in cohorts of DMD patients. These two pathways converge in that they both regulate TGFβ. A third modifier, Anxa6 that specifies annexin A6, is a calcium binding protein that has been identified using mouse models, and regulates the injury pathway and sarcolemmal resealing.
Genetic modifiers can serve as biomarkers for outcomes in DMD. Modifiers can alter strength and ambulation in muscular dystrophy, and these same features can be used as endpoints used in clinical trials. Moreover, because genetic modifiers can influence outcomes, these genetic markers should be considered when stratifying results in muscular dystrophy.",,,,2015-08-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

This review highlights recent progress in genetically based therapies targeting the primary defect of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. What advances does it highlight? Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying Duchenne muscular dystrophy, leading to the development of genetic therapies. These include manipulation of the expression of the gene or related genes, the splicing of the gene and its translation, and replacement of the gene using viral approaches. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In the absence of the dystrophin protein, the link between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix is destroyed, and this severely compromises the strength, flexibility and stability of muscle fibres. The devastating consequence is progressive muscle wasting and premature death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. There is currently no cure, and despite exhaustive palliative care, patients are restricted to a wheelchair by the age of 12 years and usually succumb to cardiac or respiratory complications in their late 20s. This review provides an update on the current genetically based therapies and clinical trials that target or compensate for the primary defect of this disease.

Cell therapy (CT) is an experimental approach to treat MD. The first clinical trials of CT in MD conducted in the 1990s were based on myoblast transplantation (MT). Since they did not yield the expected results, several researchers sought to discover other cells with more advantageous properties than myoblasts whereas others sought to improve MT.
We explain the properties that are required for a cell to be used in CT of MD. We briefly review most of the cells that were proposed for this CT, and to what extent these properties were met not only in laboratory animals but also in clinical trials.
Although the repertoire of cells proposed for CT of MD has been expanded since the 1990s, only myoblasts have currently demonstrated unequivocally to significantly engraft in humans.

Yet, this pathway is poorly investigated in children suffering from DMD. Endothelial dysfunction can affect the perfusion of contracting muscles, thus leading to ischemia and hypoxia. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that reduced NO production due to elevated synthesis of N (G),N (G)-dimethyl-L-arginine (asymmetric dimethylarginine, ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthesis, is a possible pathophysiological mechanism for progressive intramuscular muscle ischemia and disturbed endothelial function in children with DMD. Given the possible antagonistic action of homoarginine (hArg) on ADMA, we also analyzed this amino acid. We investigated 55 male patients with DMD and 54 healthy male controls (HC; aged 11.9 ± 4.8 vs. 11.1 ± 4.9 years, mean ± SD). Urinary creatinine and metabolites of the L-Arg/NO pathway were measured in plasma and urine by GC-MS or GC-MS/MS. Urine levels of ADMA and its major urinary metabolite dimethylamine (DMA), nitrite and nitrate (P < 0.001 for all) and hArg (P = 0.002) were significantly higher in DMD patients compared to HC, while the urinary DMA/ADMA molar ratio was lower (P = 0.002). In plasma, nitrate (P < 0.001), hArg (P = 0.002) and the hArg/ADMA ratio (P < 0.001) were lower in DMD than in HC. In plasma, ADMA (631 ± 119 vs. 595 ± 129 nM, P = 0.149), arginine and nitrite did not differ between DMD and HC. In DMD, positive correlations between ADMA, DMA or nitrate excretion and the stage of disease (according to Vignos and Thompson) were found. In DMD patients on steroid medication, lower concentrations of ADMA in plasma, and of DMA, ADMA, nitrate and hArg in urine were observed compared to non-treated patients. The L-Arg/NO pathway is impaired in DMD patients, with the disease progression being clinically negatively correlated with the extent of impairment. One of the underlying mechanisms in DMD may involve insufficient antagonism of ADMA by hArg.

By using a comprehensive high-resolution mass spectrometry approach and western blot validation, we found that two fragments of the myofibrillar structural protein myomesin-3 (MYOM3) are abnormally present in sera of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D (LGMD2D) and their respective animal models. Levels of MYOM3 fragments were assayed in therapeutic model systems: (1) restoration of dystrophin expression by antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon-skipping in mdx mice and (2) stable restoration of α-sarcoglycan expression in KO-SGCA mice by systemic injection of a viral vector. Following administration of the therapeutic agents MYOM3 was restored toward wild-type levels. In the LGMD model, where different doses of vector were used, MYOM3 restoration was dose-dependent. MYOM3 fragments showed lower inter-individual variability compared with the commonly used creatine kinase assay, and correlated better with the restoration of the dystrophin-associated protein complex and muscle force. These data suggest that the MYOM3 fragments hold promise for minimally invasive assessment of experimental therapies for DMD and other neuromuscular disorders.",,,,2015-06-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The identification of the gene altered by mutations in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy was one of the earliest examples of this paradigm. The nearly 30 years of research partly outlined here exemplifies the road that similar current gene discovery protocols will be expected to travel, albeit much more rapidly owing to improved diagnosis of genetic disorders and an understanding of the spectrum of mutations thought to cause them. The identification of the protein dystrophin has led to a new understanding of the muscle cell membrane and the proteins involved in membrane stability, as well as new candidate genes for additional forms of muscular dystrophy. Animal models identified with naturally occurring mutations and developed by genetic manipulation have furthered the understanding of disease progression and underlying pathology. The biochemistry and molecular analysis of patient samples have led to the different dystrophin-dependent and -independent therapies that are currently close to or in human clinical trials.

Methods & clinical development,"Preclinical gene therapy strategies using recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy have shown dramatic phenotype improvements, but long-lasting efficacy remains questionable. It is believed that in dystrophic muscles, transgene persistence is hampered, notably by the progressive loss of therapeutic vector genomes resulting from muscle fibers degeneration. Intracellular metabolic perturbations resulting from dystrophin deficiency could also be additional factors impacting on rAAV genomes and transgene mRNA molecular fate. In this study, we showed that rAAV genome loss is not the only cause of reduced transgene mRNA level and we assessed the contribution of transcriptional and post-transcriptional factors. We ruled out the implication of transgene silencing by epigenetic mechanisms and demonstrated that rAAV inhibition occurred mostly at the post-transcriptional level. Since Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) physiopathology involves an elevated oxidative stress, we hypothesized that in dystrophic muscles, transgene mRNA could be damaged by oxidative stress. In the mouse and dog dystrophic models, we found that rAAV-derived mRNA oxidation was increased. Interestingly, when a high expression level of a therapeutic transgene is achieved, oxidation is less pronounced. These findings provide new insights into rAAV transductions in dystrophic muscles, which ultimately may help in the design of more effective clinical trials.",,,,2015-06-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Several lines of evidence suggest a detrimental role of the inflammatory process in the dystrophic process. Previously, we demonstrated that short-term therapy with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), at early stages of disease, ameliorated dystrophy progression in the mdx mouse. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a long-term therapy with omega-3 later in dystrophy progression. Three-month-old mdx mice received omega-3 (300 mg/kg) or vehicle by gavage for 5 months. The quadriceps and diaphragm muscles were removed and processed for histopathology and Western blot. Long-term therapy with omega-3 increased the regulatory protein MyoD and muscle regeneration and reduced markers of inflammation (TNF-α and NF-kB) in both muscles studied.

This disease has been studied using a variety of animal models including fish, mice, rats, and dogs. While these models have contributed substantially to our mechanistic understanding of the disease and disease progression, limitations inherent to each model have slowed the clinical advancement of therapies, which necessitates the development of novel large-animal models. Several porcine dystrophin-deficient models have been identified, although disease severity may be so severe as to limit their potential contributions to the field. We have recently identified and completed the initial characterization of a natural porcine model of dystrophin insufficiency. Muscles from these animals display characteristic focal necrosis concomitant with decreased abundance and localization of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex components. These pigs recapitulate many of the cardinal features of muscular dystrophy, have elevated serum creatine kinase activity, and preliminarily appear to display altered locomotion. They also suffer from sudden death preceded by EKG abnormalities. Pig dystrophinopathy models could allow refinement of dosing strategies in human-sized animals in preparation for clinical trials. From an animal handling perspective, these pigs can generally be treated normally, with the understanding that acute stress can lead to sudden death.

Patients do not only experience skeletal muscle degeneration, but also develop severe cardiomyopathy by their second decade, one of the main causes of death. The absence of dystrophin in the heart renders cardiomyocytes more sensitive to stretch-induced damage. Moreover, it pathologically alters intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) localization and mitochondrial function and leads to inflammation and necrosis, all contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy. Current therapies only treat symptoms and therefore the need for targeting the genetic defect is immense. Several preclinical therapies are undergoing development, including utrophin up-regulation, stop codon read-through therapy, viral gene therapy, cell-based therapy and exon skipping. Some of these therapies are undergoing clinical trials, but these have predominantly focused on skeletal muscle correction. However, improving skeletal muscle function without addressing cardiac aspects of the disease may aggravate cardiomyopathy and therefore it is essential that preclinical and clinical focus include improving heart function. This review consolidates what is known regarding molecular pathology of the DMD heart, specifically focusing on intracellular Ca2+, nNOS and mitochondrial dysregulation.

However, they have limited therapeutic value, and their combination with drugs already in use to treat other human diseases could potentially increase corticoid outcomes in DMD. In the present study, we evaluated whether a combined therapy of the corticoid deflazacort with doxycycline could result in greater improvement in mdx dystrophy than deflazacort alone. Deflazacort alone or deflazacort/doxycycline were administered for 36 days (starting on postnatal day 0) in drinking water. Histopathological, biochemical (creatine kinase), functional (forelimb muscle grip strength and fatigue) parameters and inflammatory markers (MMP-9, TNF-α, NF-kB) were evaluated in biceps brachii and diaphragm muscles of the mdx mice. The combined therapy was superior in improving the dystrophic phenotype compared to monotherapy. The primary results were observed in attenuating muscle fatigue, decreasing muscle total calcium and inflammatory markers and increasing β-dystroglycan, a main component of the dystrophin-protein complex. Furthermore, the combined therapy was effective in preventing the loss of body mass observed with deflazacort alone at this very early stage of therapy.

There is currently no cure for DMD although various promising approaches are progressing through human clinical trials. By pharmacologically modulating the expression of the dystrophin-related protein utrophin, we have previously demonstrated in dystrophin-deficient mdx studies, daily SMT C1100 treatment significantly reduced muscle degeneration leading to improved muscle function. This manuscript describes the significant disease modifying benefits associated with daily dosing of SMT022357, a second-generation compound in this drug series with improved physicochemical properties and a more robust metabolism profile. These studies in the mdx mouse demonstrate that oral administration of SMT022357 leads to increased utrophin expression in skeletal, respiratory and cardiac muscles. Significantly, utrophin expression is localized along the length of the muscle fibre, not just at the synapse, and is fibre-type independent, suggesting that drug treatment is modulating utrophin transcription in extra-synaptic myonuclei. This results in improved sarcolemmal stability and prevents dystrophic pathology through a significant reduction of regeneration, necrosis and fibrosis. All these improvements combine to protect the mdx muscle from contraction induced damage and enhance physiological function. This detailed evaluation of the SMT C1100 drug series strongly endorses the therapeutic potential of utrophin modulation as a disease modifying therapeutic strategy for all DMD patients irrespective of their dystrophin mutation.",,,,2015-05-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Based on preclinical and phase 2 evidence, we assessed the efficacy and safety of idebenone in young patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were not taking concomitant glucocorticoids.
In a multicentre phase 3 trial in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Spain, and the USA, patients (age 10-18 years old) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio with a central interactive web response system with a permuted block design with four patients per block to receive idebenone (300 mg three times a day) or matching placebo orally for 52 weeks. Study personnel and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) as percentage predicted (PEF%p) from baseline to week 52, measured with spirometry. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) and a modified ITT (mITT), which was prospectively defined to exclude patients with at least 20% difference in the yearly change in PEF%p, measured with hospital-based and weekly home-based spirometry.

Idebenone also had a significant effect on PEF (L/min), weekly home-based PEF, FVC, and FEV1. The effect of idebenone on respiratory function outcomes was similar between patients with previous corticosteroid use and steroid-naive patients. Treatment with idebenone was safe and well tolerated with adverse event rates were similar in both groups. Nasopharyngitis and headache were the most common adverse events (idebenone, eight [25%] and six [19%] of 32 patients; placebo, nine [26%] and seven [21%] of 34 patients). Transient and mild diarrhoea was more common in the idebenone group than in the placebo group (eight [25%] vs four [12%] patients).
Idebenone reduced the loss of respiratory function and represents a new treatment option for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

It has achieved greatest maturity in exon skipping of the dystrophin transcript in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), for which several clinical trials are completed or ongoing, and a large body of data exists describing tested oligonucleotides and their efficacy. The rational design of an exon skipping oligonucleotide involves the choice of an antisense sequence, usually between 15 and 32 nucleotides, targeting the exon that is to be skipped. Although parameters describing the target site can be computationally estimated and several have been identified to correlate with efficacy, methods to predict efficacy are limited. Here, an in silico pre-screening approach is proposed, based on predictive statistical modelling. Previous DMD data were compiled together and, for each oligonucleotide, some 60 descriptors were considered. Statistical modelling approaches were applied to derive algorithms that predict exon skipping for a given target site. We confirmed (1) the binding energetics of the oligonucleotide to the RNA, and (2) the distance in bases of the target site from the splice acceptor site, as the two most predictive parameters, and we included these and several other parameters (while discounting many) into an in silico screening process, based on their capacity to predict high or low efficacy in either phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (89% correctly predicted) and/or 2'O Methyl RNA oligonucleotides (76% correctly predicted). Predictions correlated strongly with in vitro testing for sixteen de novo PMO sequences targeting various positions on DMD exons 44 (R² 0.89) and 53 (R² 0.89), one of which represents a potential novel candidate for clinical trials.

Although the canine disease is a model of the human disease, the variable severity of clinical presentations in the canine may be problematic for pre-clinical trials, but also informative. Here we describe a family of Labrador Retrievers with three generations of male dogs having markedly increased serum creatine kinase activity, absence of membrane dystrophin, but with undetectable clinical signs of muscle weakness. Clinically normal young male Labrador Retriever puppies were evaluated prior to surgical neuter by screening laboratory blood work, including serum creatine kinase activity. Serum creatine kinase activities were markedly increased in the absence of clinical signs of muscle weakness. Evaluation of muscle biopsies confirmed a dystrophic phenotype with both degeneration and regeneration. Further evaluations by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis confirmed the absence of muscle dystrophin. Although dystrophin was not identified in the muscles, we did not find any detectable deletions or duplications in the dystrophin gene. Sequencing is now ongoing to search for point mutations. Our findings in this family of Labrador Retriever dogs lend support to the hypothesis that, in exceptional situations, muscle with no dystrophin may be functional.

The aims of this study were to assess the effects produced on motor function by different DMD genotypes and early initiation of glucocorticoids.
Through the NorthStar Network, standardised clinical data including the NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment score (NSAA) on 513 ambulant UK boys with DMD were analysed from 2004 to 2012. For the analysis of the genetic subpopulation, we also included data from 172 Italian boys with DMD. NSAA raw scores were converted into linear scores.
On the linearised NSAA, we observed an average decline of 8 units/year (4 units on raw NSAA analysis) after age 7.

Muscle magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the degree of fatty infiltration of the thigh muscles of 171 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mean age, 6.09 ± 2.30 years). Fatty infiltration was assigned using a modified Mercuri's scale 0-5 (normal-severe). The gluteus maximus and adductor magnus were affected in patients less than two years old, followed by the biceps femoris. Quadriceps and semimembranosus were first affected at the age of five to six years; the sartorius, gracilis and adductor longus remained apparently unaffected until seven years of age. Fatty infiltration of all the thigh muscles developed rapidly after seven years of age. The standard deviation of the fatty infiltration scores ranged from 2.41 to 4.87 before five years old, and from 6.84 to 11.66 between six and ten years old. This study provides evidence of highly variable degrees of fatty infiltration in children of different ages with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and indicates that fatty infiltration progresses more quickly after seven years of age.

25683525,Evidence for metabolic aberrations in asymptomatic persons with type 2 diabetes after initiation of simvastatin therapy.,,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,"Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) prevent vascular events and are widely prescribed, particularly in persons with type 2 diabetes. However, intolerability because of myopathic symptoms often limits their use. We investigated the effects of simvastatin on parameters of mitochondrial function and muscle gene expression in 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes, none of whom had statin intolerance. After withdrawal of statins for 2 months, we obtained blood samples, performed vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, and assessed whole body resting energy expenditure (REE). We then reinitiated therapy using simvastatin, 20 mg/d, for 1 month before repeating these studies. As expected, simvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein, but did not induce myalgias or significant increases in serum creatine kinase. However, we found subtle but significant reductions in muscle citrate synthase activity and REE. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and gene set enrichment analysis of muscle samples revealed significantly repressed gene sets involved in mitochondrial function and induced gene sets involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the effects of simvastatin on muscle gene sets showed some similarities to previously described changes that occur in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Although statins inhibit an early step in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, we observed no differences in CoQ content within skeletal muscle mitochondria, muscle tissue, or circulating platelets. In summary, we report subtle changes in whole body energetics, mitochondrial citrate synthase activity, and microarray data consistent with subclinical myopathy. Although the benefits of statin therapy are clear, further understanding of muscular perturbations should help guide safety and tolerability.",,,,2015-02-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In patients who have lost ambulation, there are few validated and informative outcome measures. In addition, longitudinal data demonstrating sensitivity to clinical evolution of outcome measures over short-term periods are lacking.
We report here the results of a one-year multicenter study using specifically designed tools to assess grip, pinch strength, and hand function in wheelchair-bound patients. Our study assessed 53 non-ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 17.1 ± 4.8 years (range: 9 - 28.1 years). The average Brooke functional score of these patients was 4.6 ± 1.1. The average forced vital capacity was 44.5% predicted and 19 patients used non-invasive ventilation. Patients were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and one year using the Motor Function Measure and innovative devices (namely the MyoSet composed of MyoGrip, MyoPinch, and MoviPlate).
Our study confirmed preliminary data previously reported regarding feasibility of use and of reliability of the MyoSet and the correlation at baseline between distal strength and clinical outcomes such as FVC, Brooke score, age, and duration since loss of ambulation. A significant correlation was observed between the distal upper limb strength and clinical variables.

25642938,Functional correction in mouse models of muscular dystrophy using exon-skipping tricyclo-DNA oligomers.,,Nature medicine,"Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) hold promise for therapeutic correction of many genetic diseases via exon skipping, and the first AON-based drugs have entered clinical trials for neuromuscular disorders. However, despite advances in AON chemistry and design, systemic use of AONs is limited because of poor tissue uptake, and recent clinical reports confirm that sufficient therapeutic efficacy has not yet been achieved. Here we present a new class of AONs made of tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA), which displays unique pharmacological properties and unprecedented uptake by many tissues after systemic administration. We demonstrate these properties in two mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a neurogenetic disease typically caused by frame-shifting deletions or nonsense mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin and characterized by progressive muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure and neurocognitive impairment. Although current naked AONs do not enter the heart or cross the blood-brain barrier to any substantial extent, we show that systemic delivery of tcDNA-AONs promotes a high degree of rescue of dystrophin expression in skeletal muscles, the heart and, to a lesser extent, the brain. Our results demonstrate for the first time a physiological improvement of cardio-respiratory functions and a correction of behavioral features in DMD model mice. This makes tcDNA-AON chemistry particularly attractive as a potential future therapy for patients with DMD and other neuromuscular disorders or with other diseases that are eligible for exon-skipping approaches requiring whole-body treatment.",,,,2015-02-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, clinical trials with new therapeutic strategies are being conducted or considered. A comprehensive database is critical for patient recruitment and efficacy evaluation. China has the largest population, yet, no comprehensive database for DMD/BMD is available. Our study registered the data of the DMD/BMD patients in East China.
A modified registry form of Remudy ( http://www.remudy.jp/ ) was applied to Chinese DMD/BMD patients through the outpatient clinic at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai during the period of August 2011 to December 2013. The data included geographic distribution of patients, age at diagnosis, clinical manifestation, genetic analysis and treatment status.
194 DMD and 35 BMD patients were registered. Most patients lived in East China, namely Jiangsu province, Anhui province, Zhejiang province, Jiangxi province, Shanghai, Fujian province and Shandong province.

Neurology,"Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of death in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and myocardial damage precedes decline in left ventricular systolic function. We tested the efficacy of eplerenone on top of background therapy in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with early myocardial disease.
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, boys from three centres in the USA aged 7 years or older with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myocardial damage by late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MRI and preserved ejection fraction received either eplerenone 25 mg or placebo orally, every other day for the first month and once daily thereafter, in addition to background clinician-directed therapy with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Computer-generated randomisation was done centrally using block sizes of four and six, and only the study statistician and the investigational pharmacy had the preset randomisation assignments. The primary outcome was change in left ventricular circumferential strain (Ecc) at 12 months, a measure of contractile dysfunction. Safety was established through serial serum potassium levels and measurement of cystatin C, a non-creatinine measure of kidney function. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01521546.
Between Jan 26, 2012, and July 3, 2013, 188 boys were screened and 42 were enrolled. 20 were randomly assigned to receive eplerenone and 22 to receive placebo, of whom 20 in the eplerenone group and 20 in the placebo group completed baseline, 6-month, and 12-month visits. After 12 months, decline in left ventricular circumferential strain was less in those who received eplerenone than in those who received placebo (median ΔEcc 1·0 [IQR 0·3-2·2] vs 2·2 [1·3-3·1]; p=0·020). Cystatin C concentrations remained normal in both groups, and all non-haemolysed blood samples showed normal potassium concentrations. One 23-year-old patient in the placebo group died of fat embolism, and another patient in the placebo group withdrew from the trial to address long-standing digestive issues. All other adverse events were mild: short-lived headaches coincident with seasonal allergies occurred in one patient given eplerenone, flushing occurred in one patient given placebo, and anxiety occurred in another patient given placebo.
In boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and preserved ejection fraction, addition of eplerenone to background ACEI or ARB therapy attenuates the progressive decline in left ventricular systolic function. Early use of available drugs warrants consideration in this population at high risk of cardiac death, but further studies are needed to determine the effect of combination cardioprotective therapy on event-free survival in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Discarded umbilical cord is a potential source of mesenchymal stem cells which are non-immunogenic and can be used for transplantation in allogenic set ups. Given the regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), here we investigated its role in the cellular therapy of DMD patients.
This is a single-blinded study conducted in various hospitals of India situated in Mumbai, Delhi, and Lucknow. Inclusion criteria for enrolling the patients in the study were boys aged between 5 to 18 years, absence of dystrophin in the immunohistochemistry of muscle biopsy and mutation in dystrophin gene in cytogenetic analysis. The exclusion criteria were presence of dystrophin in the muscle biopsy, patients on corticosteroids etc. UC-MSCs (2 millions/kg body weight) were administered through IV and IM injection. Muscle power in muscles of proximal upper limb, distal upper limb, proximal lower limb, distal lower limb, hip flexors, hip extensors, hip abductors, and paraspinal muscles were measured in 11 DMD patients after UC-MSCs transplantation and were followed for up to 3 years (average follow up 1.5 years). 5 DMD patients did not receive any UC-MSCs transplantation and served as the control group.
The treatment group (N = 11 at baseline) had a pretransplantation strength of 3.45 ± 1.0357 and 4.090 ± 0.8312 in muscles of proximal upper limb and distal upper limb respectively. After 1 year (N = 9) these strengths remained stable with an average of 3.78 (1.03) and 4.22 (0.83). In contrast, the control group (N = 5) has a pre-transplantation strength of 3.6 (0.54) and 4 (1) in the proximal and distal upper limb respectively. After 1 year, (N = 5) 3/5 subjects had a slight but not statistically significant decrease in the proximal upper limb, mean 3.0 (1.0) and 5/5 had a lunit decrease in strength, mean 3.0 (1.0).

25503955,Nocturnal mechanical ventilation for chronic hypoventilation in patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disorders.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Chronic alveolar hypoventilation is a common complication of many neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. Long-term nocturnal mechanical ventilation is commonly used to treat it. This is a 2014 update of a review first published in 2000 and previously updated in 2007.
To examine the effects on mortality of nocturnal mechanical ventilation in people with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders. Subsidiary endpoints were to examine the effects of respiratory assistance on improvement of chronic hypoventilation, sleep quality, hospital admissions and quality of life.
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 10 June 2014. We contacted authors of identified trials and other experts in the field.
We searched for quasi-randomised or randomised controlled trials of participants of all ages with neuromuscular or chest wall disorder-related stable chronic hypoventilation of all degrees of severity, receiving any type and any mode of long-term nocturnal mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome measure was one-year mortality and secondary outcomes were unplanned hospital admission, short-term and long-term reversal of hypoventilation-related clinical symptoms and daytime hypercapnia, improvement of lung function and sleep breathing disorders.
We used standard Cochrane methodology to select studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias in included studies.
The 10 eligible trials included a total of 173 participants. Roughly half of the trials were at low risk of selection, attrition or reporting bias, and almost all were at high risk of performance and detection bias. Four trials reported mortality data in the long term. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of dying was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.91, P value = 0.01) in favour of nocturnal mechanical ventilation compared to spontaneous breathing. There was considerable and significant heterogeneity between the trials, possibly related to differences between the study populations. Information on unplanned hospitalisation was available from two studies. The corresponding pooled RR was 0.25 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.82, P value = 0.02) in favour of nocturnal mechanical ventilation. For most of the outcome measures there was no significant long-term difference between nocturnal mechanical ventilation and no ventilation. Most of the secondary outcomes were not assessed in the eligible trials. Three out of the 10 trials, accounting for 39 participants, two with a cross-over design and one with two parallel groups, compared volume- and pressure-cycled non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the short term. From the only trial (16 participants) on parallel groups, there was no difference in mortality (one death in each arm) between volume- and pressure-cycled mechanical ventilation. Data from the two cross-over trials suggested that compared with pressure-cycled ventilation, volume-cycled ventilation was associated with less sleep time spent with an arterial oxygen saturation below 90% (mean difference (MD) 6.83 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 8.98, P value = 0.00001) and a lower apnoea-hypopnoea (per sleep hour) index (MD -0.65, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.46, P value = 0.00001). We found no study that compared invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation or intermittent positive pressure versus negative pressure ventilation.
Current evidence about the therapeutic benefit of mechanical ventilation is of very low quality, but is consistent, suggesting alleviation of the symptoms of chronic hypoventilation in the short term. In four small studies, survival was prolonged and unplanned hospitalisation was reduced, mainly in participants with motor neuron diseases. With the exception of motor neuron disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for which the natural history supports the survival benefit of mechanical ventilation against no ventilation, further larger randomised trials should assess the long-term benefit of different types and modes of nocturnal mechanical ventilation on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, and its cost-benefit ratio in neuromuscular and chest wall diseases.",,,,2014-12-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

It has recently been reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the SPP1 and LTBP4 loci can account for some of the inter-individual variability observed in the clinical disease course. The validation of genetic association in large independent cohorts is a key process for rare diseases in order to qualify prognostic biomarkers and stratify patients in clinical trials.
Duchenne patients from five European neuromuscular centres were included. Information about age at wheelchair dependence and steroid use was gathered. Melting curve analysis of PCR fragments or Sanger sequencing were used to genotype SNP rs28357094 in the SPP1 gene in 336 patients. The genotype of SNPs rs2303729, rs1131620, rs1051303 and rs10880 in the LTBP4 locus was determined in 265 patients by mass spectrometry. For both loci, a multivariate analysis was performed, using genotype/haplotype, steroid use and cohort as covariates.
We show that corticosteroid treatment and the IAAM haplotype of the LTBP4 gene are significantly associated with prolonged ambulation in patients with DMD. There was no significant association between the SNP rs28357094 in the SPP1 gene and the age of ambulation loss.
This study underlines the importance of replicating genetic association studies for rare diseases in large independent cohorts to identify the most robust associations. We anticipate that genotyping of validated genetic associations will become important for the design and interpretation of clinical trials.",,We show that corticosteroid treatment and the IAAM haplotype of the LTBP4 gene are significantly associated with prolonged ambulation in patients with DMD.

In this study, we built composite biomarkers for use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy by combining values from two objective measures of disease severity: electrical impedance myography and quantitative ultrasound and evaluating how well they correlated to standard functional measures.
Using data from an ongoing study of electrical impedance myography and quantitative ultrasound in 31 Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 26 healthy boys aged 2-14 years, we combined data sets by first creating z scores based on the normal subject data and then using simple mathematical operations (addition and multiplication) to create composite measures. These composite scores were then correlated to age and standard measures of function including the 6-minute walk test, the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, and handheld dynamometry.
Combining data sets resulted in stronger correlations with all four outcomes than for either electrical impedance myography or quantitative ultrasound alone in six of eight instances. These improvements reached statistical significance (P < 0.05) in several cases. For example, the correlation coefficient for the composite measure with the North Star Ambulatory Assessment was 0.79 but was only 0.66 and 0.67 (respectively) for gray scale level and electrical impedance myography separately.
Arithmetically derived composite scores can provide stronger correlations to functional measures than isolated biomarkers.

Moreover, sildenafil and tadalafil are used for the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients. Since our first report showing the cardioprotective effect of sildenafil in 2002, there has been tremendous growth of preclinical and clinical studies on the use of PDE5 inhibitors for cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Numerous animal studies have demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors have powerful protective effect against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, ischemic and diabetic cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the improvement of stem cell efficacy for myocardial repair. Mechanistically, PDE5 inhibitors protect the heart against I/R injury through increased expression of nitric oxide synthases, activation of protein kinase G (PKG), PKG-dependent hydrogen sulfide generation, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β - a master switch immediately proximal to mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the end effector of cardioprotection. In addition, PDE5 inhibitors enhance the sensitivity of certain types of cancer to standard chemotherapeutic drugs, including doxorubicin. Many clinical trials with PDE5 inhibitors have focused on the potential cardiovascular and anti-cancer benefits. Despite mixed results of these clinical trials, there is a continuing strong interest by basic scientists and clinical investigators in exploring their new clinical uses.

Here, AONs are administered subcutaneously and intravenously, while the less invasive oral route would be preferred. Oral delivery of encapsulated AONs supplemented with a permeation enhancer, sodium caprate, has been successfully used to target tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression in liver. To test the feasibility of orally delivered AONs for DMD, we applied 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate AONs (with or without sodium caprate supplementation) directly to the intestine of mdx mice and compared pharmacokinetics and -dynamics with intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous delivery. Intestinally infused AONs were taken up, but resulted in lower plasma levels compared to other delivery routes, although bioavailability could be largely improved by supplementation of sodium caprate. After intestinal infusion, AON levels in all tissues were lower than for other administration routes, as were the ratios of target versus nontarget organ levels, except for diaphragm and heart where comparable levels and ratios were observed. For each administration route, low levels of exon skipping in triceps was observed 3 hours post-AON administration. These data suggest that oral administration of naked 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate AONs may be feasible, but only when high AON concentrations are used in combination with sodium caprate.",,,,2014-11-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Magnetic resonance imaging shows promise as a surrogate outcome measure in both DMD and rehabilitation medicine that is capable of predicting clinical benefit years in advance of functional outcome measures. The mdx mouse reproduces the dystrophin deficiency that causes DMD and is routinely used for preclinical drug testing. There is a need to develop sensitive, non-invasive outcome measures in the mdx model that can be readily translatable to human clinical trials. Here we report the use of magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques for the non-invasive monitoring of muscle damage in mdx mice. Using these techniques, we studied dystrophic mdx muscle in mice from 6 to 12 weeks of age, examining both the peak disease phase and natural recovery phase of the mdx disease course. T2 and fat-suppressed imaging revealed significant levels of tissue with elevated signal intensity in mdx hindlimb muscles at all ages; spectroscopy revealed a significant deficiency of energy metabolites in 6-week-old mdx mice. As the mdx mice progressed from the peak disease stage to the recovery stage of disease, each of these phenotypes was either eliminated or reduced, and the cross-sectional area of the mdx muscle was significantly increased when compared to that of wild-type mice. Histology indicates that hyper-intense MRI foci correspond to areas of dystrophic lesions containing inflammation as well as regenerating, degenerating and hypertrophied myofibers. Statistical sample size calculations provide several robust measures with the ability to detect intervention effects using small numbers of animals.

Neurology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by dystrophin deficiency and muscle deterioration and preferentially affects boys. Antisense-oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping allows synthesis of partially functional dystrophin. We investigated the efficacy and safety of drisapersen, a 2'-O-methyl-phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide, given for 48 weeks.
In this exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled study we recruited male patients (≥5 years of age; time to rise from floor ≤7 s) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy from 13 specialist centres in nine countries between Sept 1, 2010, and Sept 12, 2012. By use of a computer-generated randomisation sequence, we randomly allocated patients (2:2:1:1; block size of six; no stratification) to drisapersen 6 mg/kg or placebo, each given subcutaneously and either continuously (once weekly) or intermittently (nine doses over 10 weeks). The primary endpoint was change in 6-min walk distance (6MWD) at week 25 in patients in the intention-to-treat population for whom data were available. Safety assessments included renal, hepatic, and haematological monitoring and recording of adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01153932.
We recruited 53 patients: 18 were given continuous drisapersen, 17 were given intermittent drisapersen, and 18 were given placebo (continuous and intermittent groups combined). At week 25, mean 6MWD had increased by 31·5 m (SE 9·8) from baseline for continuous drisapersen, with a mean difference in change from baseline of 35·09 m (95% CI 7·59 to 62·60; p=0·014) versus placebo. We recorded no difference in 6MWD changes from baseline between intermittent drisapersen (mean change -0·1 [SE 10·3]) and placebo (mean difference 3·51 m [-24·34 to 31·35]) at week 25. The most common adverse events in drisapersen-treated patients were injection-site reactions (14 patients given continuous drisapersen, 15 patients given intermittent drisapersen, and six given placebo) and renal events (13 for continuous drisapersen, 12 for intermittent drisapersen, and seven for placebo), most of which were subclinical proteinuria. None of the serious adverse events reported (one for continuous, two for intermittent, and two for placebo) resulted in withdrawal from the study.
Continuous drisapersen resulted in some benefit in 6MWD versus placebo at week 25. The safety findings are similar to those from previous studies. Ambulation improvements in this young population with early-stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy are encouraging but need to be confirmed in larger studies.

Eighteen Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dogs were exposed to increasing doses of GMP-manufactured vector. Treatment was well tolerated in all, and no acute nor delayed adverse effect, including systemic and immune toxicity was detected. There was a dose relationship for the amount of exon skipping with up to 80% of myofibers expressing dystrophin at the highest dose. Similarly, histological, nuclear magnetic resonance pathological indices and strength improvement responded in a dose-dependent manner. The systematic comparison of effects using different independent methods, allowed to define a minimum threshold of dystrophin expressing fibers (>33% for structural measures and >40% for strength) under which there was no clear-cut therapeutic effect.

25099136,Positive effects of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist in Camurati-Engelmann disease: a single case observation.,"Camurati-Engelmann disease, TGFβ1, losartan",American journal of medical genetics. Part A,"Camurati-Engelmann disease is characterized by hyperostosis of the long bones and the skull, muscle atrophy, severe limb pain, and progressive joint contractures in some patients. It is caused by heterozygous mutations in the transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) believed to result in improper folding of the latency-associated peptide domain of TGFβ1 and thus in increased or deregulated bioactivity. Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, has been found to downregulate the expression of TGFβ type 1 and 2 receptors. Clinical trials with losartan have shown a benefit in Marfan syndrome, while trials are underway for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other myopathies associated with TGFβ1 signaling. We hypothesized that due to its anti-TGFβ1 activity, losartan might be beneficial in Camurati-Engelmann disease. This report concerns a boy who presented at age 13 years with severe limb pain and difficulty in walking. Clinical and radiographic evaluation results were compatible with Camurati-Engelmann disease and the diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis (c.652C > T [p.Arg218Cys]). The boy underwent an experimental treatment with losartan at a dosage of 50 mg/day, orally. During the treatment period of 18 months, the intensity and frequency of limb pain decreased significantly (as shown by a pain diary), and muscle strength improved, allowing the boy to resume walking and climbing stairs. No obvious side effects were observed.

Transverse relaxation time (T2) and fat fraction were measured by MRI/MRS in lower extremity muscles of 15 boys with DMD (age 5.0-6.9 years) taking corticosteroids and 15 corticosteroid-naive boys. Subsequently, fat fraction was measured in a subset of these boys at 1 year. Finally, MRI/MRS data were collected from 16 corticosteroid-naive boys with DMD (age 5-8.9 years) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Five boys were treated with corticosteroids after baseline and the remaining 11 served as corticosteroid-naive controls.
Cross-sectional comparisons demonstrated lower muscle T2 and less intramuscular (IM) fat deposition in boys with DMD on corticosteroids, suggesting reduced inflammation/damage and fat infiltration with treatment. Boys on corticosteroids demonstrated less increase in IM fat infiltration at 1 year. Finally, T2 by MRI/MRS detected effects of corticosteroids on leg muscles as early as 3 months after drug initiation.
These results demonstrate the ability of MRI/MRS to detect therapeutic effects of corticosteroids in reducing inflammatory processes in skeletal muscles of boys with DMD.

25059011,Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a developing country: challenges in management and genetic counseling.,,"Genetic counseling (Geneva, Switzerland)","Multidisciplinary management of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) has achieved outstanding results in developed nations. We aimed to describe the status of diagnosis and management of DMD in a developing country through the experience of non-profit organizations.
A Multistate, multiple-source, population-based survey was performed from medical records of 432 patients. Data were retrospectively collected, reviewed and curated by health specialists; including clinical features, age at first symptoms, age at diagnosis, disease progression and management, family history, education, age and cause of death.
There is a delay in noticing first symptoms and it did not diminish over the past 20 years. Less than 30% of patients obtained definite diagnosis and most of them are in physiotherapy programs but not under steroid treatment. In our study, family history does not anticipate recognition of symptoms compared to sporadic cases (p = 0.05). Approximately 93.33% of our patients attended to education programs. Mean age at death was 18.94 +/- 6.73 years and the most frequent cause was pneumonia.
Delayed diagnosis of DMD in Mexico is mainly caused by the late detection of first symptoms. There is no difference in early detection of symptoms between familiar and sporadic cases. Lifespan of patients in our cohort is reduced compared to developed countries. The late diagnosis and low percentage of definite cases may affect patient management and genetic counseling and could also preclude participation of patients into novel clinical trials.",,"There is a delay in noticing first symptoms and it did not diminish over the past 20 years.

25042931,Effect of sildenafil on skeletal and cardiac muscle in Becker muscular dystrophy.,,Annals of neurology,"Patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy lack neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). nNOS mediates physiological sympatholysis, thus ensuring adequate blood supply to working muscle. In mice lacking dystrophin, restoration of nNOS effects by a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor (sildenafil) improves skeletal and cardiac muscle performance. Sildenafil also improves blood flow in patients with BMD. We therefore hypothesized that sildenafil would improve blood flow, maximal work capacity, and heart function in patients with BMD.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design with two 4-week periods of treatment, separated by 2-week washout was used. We assessed brachial artery blood flow during maximal handgrip exercise, 6-minute walk test, maximal oxidative capacity, and life quality; cardiac function was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at rest and during maximal handgrip exercise. Muscle nNOS and PDE5 were tested with Western blotting in 5 patients.
Sixteen patients completed all skeletal muscle evaluations, and 13 completed the cardiac MRI investigations. Sildenafil had no effect on any of the outcome parameters. No serious adverse effects were recorded. PDE5 and nNOS were deficient in 5 of 5 biopsies.
Despite positive evidence from animal models of dystrophinopathy and physiological findings in patients with BMD, this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study showed no effect of sildenafil on blood flow, maximal work capacity, and heart function in adults with BMD.

Adults with DBMD develop life-threatening cardiomyopathy. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) improves cardiac function in mouse models of DBMD. To determine whether the PDE5-inhibitor sildenafil benefits human dystrophinopathy, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01168908).
Adults with DBMD and cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction ≤ 50%) were randomized to receive sildenafil (20mg 3× daily) or placebo for 6 months. All subjects received an additional 6 months of open-label sildenafil. The primary endpoint was change in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary cardiac endpoints, skeletal muscle function, and quality of life were also assessed.
An interim analysis (performed after 15 subjects completed the blinded phase) revealed that 29% (4 of 14) of subjects had a ≥10% increase in LVESV after 6 months of sildenafil compared to 13% (1 of 8) of subjects receiving placebo. Subjects with LVESV > 120ml at baseline were more likely to worsen at 12 months regardless of treatment assignment (p = 0.035).

Here, we describe use of quantitative in vivo stable isotope labeling in mammals to accurately compare serum proteomes of wild-type and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. Biomarkers identified in serum from two independent dystrophin-deficient mouse models (mdx-Δ52 and mdx-23) were concordant with those identified in sera samples of DMD patients. Of the 355 mouse sera proteins, 23 were significantly elevated and 4 significantly lower in mdx relative to wild-type mice (P-value < 0.001). Elevated proteins were mostly of muscle origin: including myofibrillar proteins (titin, myosin light chain 1/3, myomesin 3 and filamin-C), glycolytic enzymes (aldolase, phosphoglycerate mutase 2, beta enolase and glycogen phosphorylase), transport proteins (fatty acid-binding protein, myoglobin and somatic cytochrome-C) and others (creatine kinase M, malate dehydrogenase cytosolic, fibrinogen and parvalbumin). Decreased proteins, mostly of extracellular origin, included adiponectin, lumican, plasminogen and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. Analysis of sera from 1 week to 7 months old mdx mice revealed age-dependent changes in the level of these biomarkers with most biomarkers acutely elevated at 3 weeks of age. Serum analysis of DMD patients, with ages ranging from 4 to 15 years old, confirmed elevation of 20 of the murine biomarkers in DMD, with similar age-related changes.

However, potential of the therapy for DMD at different stages of the disease progression is not understood. In this study, we examined the effect of peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO)-mediated exon skipping on disease progression of utrophin-dystrophin-deficient mice (dko) of four age groups (21-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50+ days), representing diseases from early stage to advanced stage with severe kyphosis. Biweekly intravenous (i.v.) administration of the PPMO restored the dystrophin expression in nearly 100% skeletal muscle fibers in all age groups. This was associated with the restoration of dystrophin-associated proteins including functional glycosylated dystroglycan and neuronal nitric synthase. However, therapeutic outcomes clearly depended on severity of the disease at the time the treatment started. The PPMO treatment alleviated the disease pathology and significantly prolonged the life span of the mice receiving treatment at younger age with mild phenotype. However, restoration of high levels of dystrophin expression failed to prevent disease progression to the mice receiving treatment when disease was already at advanced stage.

For the sake of treatment development, over and above definitive genetic and cell-based therapies, there is considerable interest in drugs that target downstream disease mechanisms. Drug candidates have typically been chosen based on the nature of pathologic lesions and presumed underlying mechanisms and then tested in animal models. Mammalian dystrophinopathies have been characterized in mice (mdx mouse) and dogs (golden retriever muscular dystrophy [GRMD]). Despite promising results in the mdx mouse, some therapies have not shown efficacy in DMD. Although the GRMD model offers a higher hurdle for translation, dogs have primarily been used to test genetic and cellular therapies where there is greater risk. Failed translation of animal studies to DMD raises questions about the propriety of methods and models used to identify drug targets and test efficacy of pharmacologic intervention. The mdx mouse and GRMD dog are genetically homologous to DMD but not necessarily analogous. Subcellular species differences are undoubtedly magnified at the whole-body level in clinical trials. This problem is compounded by disparate cultures in clinical trials and preclinical studies, pointing to a need for greater rigor and transparency in animal experiments. Molecular assays such as mRNA arrays and genome-wide association studies allow identification of genetic drug targets more closely tied to disease pathogenesis.

We designed these studies with the aim of designing a Phase II trial to evaluate the drugs' efficacy in patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. For the first trial, ISOFEN1, a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, active control, three-treatment cross-over study, was aimed at comparing the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen 200 mg and isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg when given alone and concomitantly. The pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen given alone versus ibuprofen given concomitantly with isosorbide dinitrate were similar, as documented by the lack of statistically significant differences in the main drug's pharmacokinetic parameters (time to maximal concentration [Tmax], maximal concentration [Cmax], area under the curve [AUC]0-t, and AUC0-∞). Similarly, we found that the coadministration of ibuprofen did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of isosorbide dinitrate. No issues of safety were detected. The second trial, ISOFEN2, was a single-site, dose titration study that was designed to select the maximum tolerated dose for isosorbide dinitrate when coadministered with ibuprofen. Eighteen out of the 19 enrolled subjects tolerated the treatment well, and they completed the study at the highest dose of isosorbide dinitrate applied (80 mg/day). One subject voluntarily decided to reduce the dose of isosorbide dinitrate from 80 mg to 60 mg. The treatment-related adverse events recorded during the study were, for the large majority, episodes of headache that remitted spontaneously in 0.5-1 hour - a known side effect of isosorbide dinitrate. These studies demonstrate that the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and ibuprofen does not lead to pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs; they also demonstrate that the combination of isosorbide dinitrate and ibuprofen has optimal tolerability and safety profiles that are similar to those previously reported for isosorbide dinitrate and ibuprofen given alone.",,,,2014-05-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Clinical trials with two competitive SSO drugs are underway to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Beyond DMD, many additional therapeutic applications are possible, with some in phase 1 clinical trials or advanced preclinical evaluation. Here, we present an overview of the central factors involved in developing therapeutic SSOs for the treatment of diseases. The selection of susceptible pre-mRNA target sequences, as well as the design and chemical modification of SSOs to increase SSO stability and effectiveness, are key initial considerations. Identification of effective SSO target sequences is still largely empirical and published guidelines are not a universal guarantee for success. Specifically, exon-targeted SSOs, which are successful in modifying dystrophin splicing, can be ineffective for splice-switching in other contexts. Chemical modifications, importantly, are associated with certain characteristic toxicities, which need to be addressed as target diseases require chronic treatment with SSOs. Moreover, SSO delivery in adequate quantities to the nucleus of target cells without toxicity can prove difficult. Last, the means by which these SSOs are administered needs to be acceptable to the patient. Engineering an efficient therapeutic SSO, therefore, necessarily entails a compromise between desirable qualities and effectiveness.

The aim of the present study was to identify urinary biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for muscular dystrophies. Here, the urinary proteomes of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and healthy donors were compared with a bottom-up proteomic approach. Label-free analysis of more than 1100 identified proteins revealed that 32 of them were differentially expressed between healthy controls and DMD patients. Among these 32 proteins, titin showed the highest fold change between healthy subjects and DMD patients. Interestingly, most of the sequenced peptides belong to the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of titin, and the presence of the corresponding fragments in the urine of DMD patients was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Analysis of a large cohort of DMD patients and age-matched controls (a total of 104 individuals aged from 3 to 20 years) confirmed presence of the N-ter fragment in all but two patients. In two DMD patients aged 16 and 20 years this fragment was undetectable and two healthy controls of 16 and 19 years with serum CK >800 IU/L demonstrated a low level of the fragment.

In 10 boys with DMD and 10 healthy age-matched male controls, we assessed exercise-induced attenuation of reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction, i.e., functional sympatholysis, a protective mechanism that matches oxygen delivery to metabolic demand. Reflex vasoconstriction was induced by simulated orthostatic stress, measured as the decrease in forearm muscle oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy, and performed when the forearm muscles were rested or lightly exercised with rhythmic handgrip exercise. Then, the patients underwent an open-label, dose-escalation, crossover trial with single oral doses of tadalafil or sildenafil.
The major new findings are 2-fold: first, sympatholysis is impaired in boys with DMD-producing functional muscle ischemia-despite contemporary background therapy with corticosteroids alone or in combination with cardioprotective medication. Second, PDE5 inhibition with standard clinical doses of either tadalafil or sildenafil alleviates this ischemia in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PDE5 inhibition also normalizes the exercise-induced increase in skeletal muscle blood flow (measured by Doppler ultrasound), which is markedly blunted in boys with DMD.

Spectroscopic measurements were obtained from four muscles of the lower leg in 25 boys with DMD (9.2±3.1 years) and 10 healthy boys (10.2±2.6 years). Lipid fractions and metabolite concentrations were also determined. Muscle strength, a timed functional test, and the Modified Brooke Lower Extremity Functional Scale were also determined. Lipid fractions were higher (p<0.01) for the DMD group than healthy subjects for all muscles, and lipid fraction was found to be greater in the older DMD boys. The peroneal muscle demonstrated a significant difference in lipid fraction in all DMD age groups. Lipid fractions in all muscles correlated with functional measures (r=0.52-0.70, p<0.001), with smaller inverse correlations with the strength measure (r=-0.36 to -0.56, p<0.05). These findings provide quantifiable information regarding intramuscular lipid and metabolite levels of different muscles across various age groups in boys with DMD and may be used in determining the effect of interventions in future clinical trials.",,,,2014-05-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
24747372,Assessing functional performance in the mdx mouse model.,,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe and progressive muscle wasting disorder for which no cure is available. Nevertheless, several potential pharmaceutical compounds and gene therapy approaches have progressed into clinical trials. With improvement in muscle function being the most important end point in these trials, a lot of emphasis has been placed on setting up reliable, reproducible, and easy to perform functional tests to pre clinically assess muscle function, strength, condition, and coordination in the mdx mouse model for DMD. Both invasive and noninvasive tests are available. Tests that do not exacerbate the disease can be used to determine the natural history of the disease and the effects of therapeutic interventions (e.g. forelimb grip strength test, two different hanging tests using either a wire or a grid and rotarod running). Alternatively, forced treadmill running can be used to enhance disease progression and/or assess protective effects of therapeutic interventions on disease pathology. We here describe how to perform these most commonly used functional tests in a reliable and reproducible manner.

We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of targeted delivery of AOs by conjugating a chimeric peptide, consisting of a muscle-specific peptide and a cell-penetrating peptide, to AOs in mdx mice. Although increased uptake in muscle was observed, the majority of peptide-AO conjugate was found in the liver. To search for more effective muscle-homing peptides, we carried out in vitro biopanning in myoblasts and identified a novel 12-mer peptide (M12) showing preferential binding to skeletal muscle compared to the liver. When conjugated to phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, ~25% of normal level of dystrophin expression was achieved in body-wide skeletal muscles in mdx mice with significant recovery in grip strength, whereas <2% in corresponding tissues treated with either muscle-specific peptide-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer or unmodified phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer under identical conditions. Our data provide evidences for the first time that a muscle-homing peptide alone can enhance AO delivery to muscle without appreciable toxicity at 75 mg/kg, suggesting M12-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer can be an alternative option to current AOs.",,,,2014-04-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In this context phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are compounds addressed to hybridize to a targeted mRNA inducing a variety of effects including inhibition of the expression of proteins involved in different pathological processes and preventing translation.
In this review, we provide an update on clinical efficacy and toxicological profile of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides used in experimental and clinical studies, also focusing on the use of the antisense strategy in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy which is a key pathology to study different aspects of this therapy. Pubmed/Medline was searched using the keyword ""Phosphorotioate"" combined with ""Antisense"", ""Oligonucleotide"" and ""Duchenne muscular dystrophy"".
Phosphorothioate oligonucleotide transient activation of the complement cascade represents the most evident toxicological response, as showed by in vivo studies. It is also known that many of these compounds induce a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time, a reaction which is often highly transient and proportional to the oligonucleotide plasma concentrations, making that effect clinically insignificant for the current treatment regimens. In summary, current evidence shows limited untoward effects and reversibility of the damage induced, at least for some of those compounds, with promising effectiveness for treatment of various pathologies.",,,,2014-03-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Recent advances in the development of AONs that show improved stability and increased sequence specificity have led to clinical trials for several neuromuscular diseases. Impressive preclinical and clinical data are published regarding the usage of AONs in exon-skipping and splice modulation strategies to increase dystrophin production in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and survival of motor neuron (SMN) production in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
In this review, we focus on the current progress and challenges of exon-skipping and splice modulation therapies. In addition, we discuss the recent failure of the Phase III clinical trials of exon 51 skipping (drisapersen) for DMD.
The main approach of AON therapy in DMD and SMA is to rescue ('knock up' or increase) target proteins through exon skipping or exon inclusion; conversely, most conventional antisense drugs are designed to knock down (inhibit) the target. Encouraging preclinical data using this 'knock up' approach are also reported to rescue dysferlinopathies, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.",,,,2014-03-14,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In particular, the efficacy of antisense therapy for suppression of normal, pathogenic, or cryptic splice sites has been demonstrated in cellular and animal models and has already reached the clinical trials phase for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In different inherited metabolic diseases, splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been used with success in patients' cells to force pseudoexon skipping or to block cryptic splice sites, in both cases recovering normal transcript and protein and correcting the enzyme deficiency. However, future in vivo studies require individual approaches for delivery depending on the gene defect involved, given the different patterns of tissue and organ expression. Herein we review the state of the art of antisense therapy targeting RNA splicing in metabolic diseases, grouped according to their expression patterns-multisystemic, hepatic, or in central nervous system (CNS)-and summarize the recent progress achieved in the field of in vivo delivery of oligonucleotides to each organ or system.

In this study, we hypothesized that muscle-specific microRNAs (miR-1, -133, and -206) in serum may be useful for monitoring the DMD pathological progression, and explored the possibility of these miRNAs as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the disease. By using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a randomized and controlled trial, we detected that miR-1, -133, and -206 were significantly over-expressed in the serum of 39 children with DMD (up to 3.20 ± 1.20, 2(-ΔΔCt) ): almost 2- to 4-fold enriched in comparison to samples from the healthy controls (less than 1.15 ± 0.34, 2(-ΔΔCt) ). To determine whether these miRNAs were related to the clinical features of children with DMD, we analyzed the associations compared to creatine kinase. There were very good inverse correlations between the levels of these miRNAs, especially miR-206, and functional performances: high levels corresponded to low muscle strength, muscle function, and quality of life. Moreover, by receiver operating characteristic curves analyses, we revealed that these miRNAs, especially miR-206, were able to discriminate DMD from controls. Thus, miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs in serum are useful for monitoring the DMD pathological progression, and hence as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the disease. There has been a long-standing need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We found that the levels of muscle-specific microRNAs, especially miR-206, in the serum of DMD were 2- to 4-fold higher than in the controls. High levels corresponded to low muscle strength, muscle function, and quality of life (QoL). These miRNAs were able to discriminate DMD from controls by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses.

Part A,"The neurofibromatoses (NF) are autosomal dominant genetic disorders that encompass the rare diseases NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. The NFs affect more people worldwide than Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease combined. NF1 and NF2 are caused by mutations of known tumor suppressor genes (NF1 and NF2, respectively). For schwannomatosis, although mutations in SMARCB1 were identified in a subpopulation of schwannomatosis patients, additional causative gene mutations are still to be discovered. Individuals with NF1 may demonstrate manifestations in multiple organ systems, including tumors of the nervous system, learning disabilities, and physical disfigurement. NF2 ultimately can cause deafness, cranial nerve deficits, and additional severe morbidities caused by tumors of the nervous system. Unmanageable pain is a key finding in patients with schwannomatosis. Although today there is no marketed treatment for NF-related tumors, a significant number of clinical trials have become available. In addition, significant preclinical efforts have led to a more rational selection of potential drug candidates for NF trials. An important element in fueling this progress is the sharing of knowledge. For over 20 years the Children's Tumor Foundation has convened an annual NF Conference, bringing together NF professionals to share novel findings, ideas, and build collaborations.

The 6MWT was performed in 191 ambulant DMD boys at baseline and 12 months later. The results were analysed using a test for heterogeneity in order to establish possible differences among different types of mutations (deletions, duplications, point mutations) and among subgroups of deletions eligible to skip individual exons.

They display several of the structural characteristics of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Ataluren (PTC124) is proposed to cause readthrough of premature stop codons and has been introduced as a potential treatment of genetic disorders. Clinical trials in DMD have shown promise, although with complex dose dependency. We have established physiology techniques, enabling high resolution of contractile function in skeletal muscle of zebrafish larvae. We aimed to provide a mechanical analysis of sapje larval muscle and examine effects of ataluren. Homozygous 5 d postfertilization (dpf) sapje larvae exhibited structural defects with 50% decrease in active tension. Ataluren (0.1-1 μM, 3-5 dpf) improved contractile function (~60% improvement of force at 0.5 μM) and dystrophin expression. Controls were not affected. Higher doses (5 μM, 35 μM) impaired contractile function, an effect also observed in controls, suggesting unspecific negative effects at high concentrations. In summary, Sapje larvae exhibit impaired contractile performance and provide a relevant DMD model for functional studies. Ataluren significantly improves skeletal muscle function in the sapje larvae, most likely reflecting an observed increase in dystrophin expression.

Ataluren (PTC124) enables ribosomal readthrough of premature stop codons, leading to production of full-length, functional proteins.
This Phase 2a open-label, sequential dose-ranging trial recruited 38 boys with nonsense mutation DMD. The first cohort (n = 6) received ataluren three times per day at morning, midday, and evening doses of 4, 4, and 8 mg/kg; the second cohort (n = 20) was dosed at 10, 10, 20 mg/kg; and the third cohort (n = 12) was dosed at 20, 20, 40 mg/kg. Treatment duration was 28 days. Change in full-length dystrophin expression, as assessed by immunostaining in pre- and post-treatment muscle biopsy specimens, was the primary endpoint.
Twenty three of 38 (61%) subjects demonstrated increases in post-treatment dystrophin expression in a quantitative analysis assessing the ratio of dystrophin/spectrin. A qualitative analysis also showed positive changes in dystrophin expression. Expression was not associated with nonsense mutation type or exon location. Ataluren trough plasma concentrations active in the mdx mouse model were consistently achieved at the mid- and high- dose levels in participants. Ataluren was generally well tolerated.
Ataluren showed activity and safety in this short-term study, supporting evaluation of ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg and 20, 20, 40 mg/kg in a Phase 2b, double-blind, long-term study in nonsense mutation DMD.

24320790,Peptide conjugation of 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides enhances cardiac uptake and exon skipping in mdx mice.,,Nucleic acid therapeutics,"Antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that is currently being tested in various clinical trials. This approach is based on restoring the open reading frame of dystrophin transcripts resulting in shorter but partially functional dystrophin proteins as found in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy. After systemic administration, a large proportion of AONs ends up in the liver and kidneys. Therefore, enhancing AON uptake by skeletal and cardiac muscle would improve the AONs' therapeutic effect. For phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, AONs use nonspecific positively charged cell penetrating peptides to enhance efficacy. However, this is challenging for negatively charged 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligomer. Therefore, we screened a 7-mer phage display peptide library to identify muscle and heart homing peptides in vivo in the mdx mouse model and found a promising candidate peptide capable of binding muscle cells in vitro and in vivo. Upon systemic administration in dystrophic mdx mice, conjugation of a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate AON to this peptide indeed improved uptake in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and resulted in higher exon skipping levels with a significant difference in heart and diaphragm. Based on these results, peptide conjugation represents an interesting strategy to enhance the therapeutic effect of exon skipping with 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate AONs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",,,,2013-12-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Eighteen studies were included and overall study quality was weak. Those with ALS/MND had improved somnolence and fatigue as well as prolonged survival with NIPPV. For OHS, improvements in somnolence and fatigue, dyspnoea and sleep quality were demonstrated, while for RTD, measures of dyspnoea, sleep quality, physical function and health, mental and emotional health and social function improved. There was insufficient evidence to form conclusions regarding the effect of NIPPV for those with DMD.

24311736,Expectations and experiences of investigators and parents involved in a clinical trial for Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy.,,"Clinical trials (London, England)","The social context of rare disease research is changing, with increased community engagement around drug development and clinical trials. This engagement may benefit patients and families but may also lead to heightened trial expectations and therapeutic misconception. Clinical investigators are also susceptible to harboring high expectations. Little is known about parental motivations and expectations for clinical trials for rare pediatric disorders.
We describe the experience of parents and clinical investigators involved in a phase II clinical trial for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: their expectations, hopes, motivations, and reactions to the termination of the trial.
This qualitative study was based on interviews with clinical investigators and parents of sons with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) who participated in the phase IIa or IIb ataluren clinical trial in the United States. Interviews were transcribed and coded for thematic analysis.
Participants were 12 parents of affected boys receiving active drug and 9 clinical investigators. High trial expectations of direct benefit were reported by parents and many clinicians. Investigators described monitoring and managing parents' expectations; several worried about their own involvement in increasing parents' expectations. Most parents were able to differentiate their expectations from their optimistic hopes for a cure. Parents' expectations arose from other parents, advocacy organizations, and the sponsor. All parents reported some degree of clinical benefit to their children. Secondary benefits were hopefulness and powerful feelings associated with active efforts to affect the disease course. Parents and clinical investigators reported strong, close relationships that were mutually important. Parents and clinicians felt valued by the sponsor for the majority of the trial. When the trial abruptly stopped, they described loss of engagement, distress, and feeling unprepared for the possibility of trial termination.
This was a retrospective study of one clinical trial. We were unable to recruit participants whose children received placebo. The interviews occurred during a time of significant uncertainty and distress for many of the participants.
This pilot study reflects complex outcomes of strong community engagement. The findings highlight a need for renewed education about, and support for, clinical trial termination and loss of drug access. The primary positive outcome was demonstration of strong relationships among committed parents and study teams. These relationships were highly valued by both parties and may suggest an ideal intervention opportunity for efforts to improve psychological well-being. A negative outcome attributed, in part, to community engagement was inappropriately high trial expectations. More optimistically, high expectations were attributed, in part, to the importance of hope and powerful feelings associated with active efforts to affect the disease course.",,"Participants were 12 parents of affected boys receiving active drug and 9 clinical investigators.

24308293,New developments in the use of gene therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Expert opinion on biological therapy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked inherited disorder characterised by progressive muscle weakness, wasting and degeneration. Although the gene affected in DMD was identified over 25 years ago, there is still no effective treatment.
Here we review some of the genetic-based strategies aimed at amelioration of the DMD phenotype. A number of Phase II/III clinical trials of antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping for restoration of the open reading frame (ORF) of the DMD gene have recently been completed. The potential strategies for overcoming the hurdles that appear to prevent exon skipping becoming an effective treatment for DMD currently are discussed.
The applicability of exon skipping as a therapy to DMD is restricted and the development of alternative strategies that are more encompassing is needed. The rapid pre-clinical advances that are being made in the field of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based delivery of micro-dystrophin would address this. The obstacles to be faced with gene replacement strategies would include the need for high viral titres, efficient muscle targeting and avoidance of immune response to vector and transgene. The new emerging field of gene editing could potentially provide permanent correction of the DMD gene and the feasibility of such an approach to DMD is discussed.",,,,2013-12-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

His parents are grappling with the decision about whether to enroll him. Among the issues under consideration are the potential risks and benefits to him, the costs of participating (because frequent, partially reimbursed travel is involved), and the potential cost savings of receiving this treatment on a research basis rather than as a clinically approved therapy. His parents seek the advice of his pediatric neurologist. After careful consideration of the various factors above, the pediatric neurologist explains to the family that participating in the trial is ethically permissible but that, given the uncertain benefits and potential for substantial expenses without benefit to the child, participation should not be regarded as ethically obligatory.",,,,2013-12-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The value of this model would be greatly enhanced with practical tools to monitor progression of respiratory dysfunction during treatment trials. Arterial blood gas analysis, tidal breathing spirometry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) were performed to determine if quantifiable abnormalities could be identified in unsedated, untrained, GRMD dogs. Results from 11 dogs with a mild phenotype of GRMD and 11 age-matched carriers were compared. Arterial blood gas analysis was successfully performed in all dogs, spirometry in 21 of 22 (95%) dogs, and RIP in 18 of 20 (90%) dogs. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate concentration were higher in GRMD dogs. Tidal breathing peak expiratory flows were markedly higher in GRMD dogs. Abnormal abdominal motion was present in 7 of 10 (70%) GRMD dogs. Each technique provided objective, quantifiable measures that will be useful for monitoring respiratory function in GRMD dogs during clinical trials while avoiding the influence of sedation on results. Increased expiratory flows and the pattern of abdominal breathing are novel findings, not reported in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and might be a consequence of hyperinflation.",,,,2013-12-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
24282529,Dystromirs as serum biomarkers for monitoring the disease severity in Duchenne muscular Dystrophy.,,PloS one,"Duchenne muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that disrupt the open reading frame, while in frame mutations result in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) is due to mutations affecting collagen VI genes. Specific muscle miRNAs (dystromirs) are potential non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring the outcome of therapeutic interventions and disease progression. We quantified miR-1, miR-133a,b, miR-206 and miR-31 in serum from patients with DMD, BMD, UCMD and healthy controls. MiR-1, miR-133a,b and miR-206 were upregulated in DMD, but unchanged in UCMD compared to controls. Milder DMD patients had higher levels of dystromirs than more severely affected patients. Patients with low forced vital capacity (FVC) values, indicating respiratory muscle weakness, had low levels of serum miR-1 and miR-133b. There was no significant difference in the level of the dystromirs in BMD compared to controls. We also assessed the effect of dystrophin restoration on the expression of the five dystromirs in serum of DMD patients treated systemically for 12 weeks with antisense oligomer eteplirsen that induces skipping of exon 51 in the dystrophin gene. The dystromirs were also analysed in muscle biopsies of DMD patients included in a single dose intramuscular eteplirsen clinical trial. Our analysis detected a trend towards normalization of these miRNA between the pre- and post-treatment samples of the systemic trial, which however failed to reach statistical significance. This could possibly be due to the small number of patients and the short duration of these clinical trials. Although longer term studies are needed to clarify the relationship between dystrophin restoration following therapeutic intervention and the level of circulating miRNAs, our results indicate that miR-1 and miR-133 can be considered as exploratory biomarkers for monitoring the progression of muscle weakness and indirectly the remaining muscle mass in DMD.",,,,2013-11-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
24240289,Muscular dystrophy: new challenges and review of the current clinical trials.,,Current opinion in pediatrics,"We provide a review of recent standards of care and therapeutic development in different forms of muscular dystrophies. This topic is relevant as the improved understanding of these disorders has not only led to a better definition of clinical course and to the development of standards of care for individual types of muscular dystrophies, but also culminated in different therapeutic approaches.
Recent natural history studies have demonstrated the impact of new standards of care in different forms of muscular dystrophies, and identified areas of clinical management in which further developments are needed. The majority of the experimental studies are focused on Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Some of them target patients with specific mutations, such as antisense oligonucleotides, to induce exon skipping of specific mutations or drugs developed to allow read-through of nonsense mutations, whereas other therapies deal with secondary aspects of muscle degeneration, aiming, for example, at reducing inflammation or apoptosis, and may also be suitable for other forms of muscular dystrophies.

24229740,Orphan drug development in muscular dystrophy: update on two large clinical trials of dystrophin rescue therapies.,,Discovery medicine,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a relatively common 'rare disorder,' with an incidence of about 1/5,000 males worldwide. The responsible gene and deficient protein (dystrophin) were identified in 1987, an early success of human molecular genetics and emerging genome projects. A rational approach to therapeutics is to replace dystrophin in patient muscle, thus addressing the primary biochemical defect. Fast forward 25 years, and two phase 2b/3 trials have been carried out with agents designed to induce de novo dystrophin production in DMD patient's muscle; ataluren (stop codon read through) with 174 patients, and drisapersen (exon skipping) with 186 patients. Both used a six minute walk test as the primary outcome measure. Neither drisapersen nor high dose ataluren showed any significant improvement in this outcome, whereas low dose ataluren is reported to show some possible improvement. Experience with ataluren and drisapersen has been disappointing and this is a good time to ask: What can we learn from these programs and how can this inform further drug development in DMD? At the times these two trials were started, there was a lack of existing data and infrastructure regarding both clinical and biochemical outcome measures. The recent publications of more extensive natural history data in multiple DMD cohorts, and ongoing efforts to define reliable and sensitive dystrophin assays are important. If the drisapersen and ataluren programs were instead begun today, new progress in biochemical and clinical endpoints may have triggered a re-design, with better de-risking in phase 2 studies prior to resource-intensive phase 3 trials.",,,,2013-11-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, an experimental model representing both muscle pathologies and displaying most of the distinctive markers has not been characterized. We investigated the cardiotoxin (CTX)-mediated transient acute mouse model of muscle degeneration and compared the cardinal features with human MDs and IMs. The CTX model displayed degeneration, apoptosis, inflammation, loss of sarcolemmal complexes, sarcolemmal disruption, and ultrastructural changes characteristic of human MDs and IMs. Cell death caused by CTX involved calcium influx and mitochondrial damage both in murine C2C12 muscle cells and in mice. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis at the initial phase of degeneration in the model detected lowered expression of 80 mitochondrial proteins including subunits of respiratory complexes, ATP machinery, fatty acid metabolism, and Krebs cycle, which further decreased in expression during the peak degenerative phase. The mass spectrometry (MS) data were supported by enzyme assays, Western blot, and histochemistry. The CTX model also displayed markers of oxidative stress and a lowered glutathione reduced/oxidized ratio (GSH/GSSG) similar to MDs, human myopathies, and neurogenic atrophies. MS analysis identified 6 unique oxidized proteins from Duchenne muscular dystrophy samples (n = 6) (versus controls; n = 6), including two mitochondrial proteins. Interestingly, these mitochondrial proteins were down-regulated in the CTX model thereby linking oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that mitochondrial alterations and oxidative damage significantly contribute to CTX-mediated muscle pathology with implications for human muscle diseases.",,,,2013-11-14,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
24217213,Biochemical characterization of patients with in-frame or out-of-frame DMD deletions pertinent to exon 44 or 45 skipping.,,JAMA neurology,"In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the reading frame of an out-of-frame DMD deletion can be repaired by antisense oligonucleotide (AO)-mediated exon skipping. This creates a shorter dystrophin protein, similar to those expressed in the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). The skipping of some exons may be more efficacious than others. Patients with exon 44 or 45 skippable deletions (AOs in clinical development) have a less predictable phenotype than those skippable for exon 51, a group in advanced clinical trials. A way to predict the potential of AOs is the study of patients with BMD who have deletions that naturally mimic those that would be achieved by exon skipping.
To quantify dystrophin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in patients with DMD deletions treatable by, or mimicking, exon 44 or 45 skipping.
Retrospective study of nondystrophic controls (n = 2), patients with DMD (n = 5), patients with intermediate muscular dystrophy (n = 3), and patients with BMD (n = 13) at 4 university-based academic centers and pediatric hospitals. Biochemical analysis of existing muscle biopsies was correlated with the severity of the skeletal muscle phenotype.
Dystrophin mRNA and protein expression.
Patients with DMD who have out-of-frame deletions skippable for exon 44 or 45 had an elevated number of revertant and trace dystrophin expression (approximately 19% of control, using quantitative immunohistochemistry) with 4 of 9 patients presenting with an intermediate muscular dystrophy phenotype (3 patients) or a BMD-like phenotype (1 patient). Corresponding in-frame deletions presented with predominantly mild BMD phenotypes and lower dystrophin levels (approximately 42% of control) than patients with BMD modeling exon 51 skipping (approximately 80% of control). All 12 patients with in-frame deletions had a stable transcript compared with 2 of 9 patients with out-of-frame deletions (who had intermediate muscular dystrophy and BMD phenotypes).
Exon 44 or 45 skipping will likely yield lower levels of dystrophin than exon 51 skipping, although the resulting protein is functional enough to often maintain a mild BMD phenotype. Dystrophin transcript stability is an important indicator of dystrophin expression, and transcript instability in DMD compared with BMD should be explored as a potential biomarker of response to AOs. This study is beneficial for the planning, execution, and analysis of clinical trials for exon 44 and 45 skipping.",,"Patients with DMD who have out-of-frame deletions skippable for exon 44 or 45 had an elevated number of revertant and trace dystrophin expression (approximately 19% of control, using quantitative immunohistochemistry) with 4 of 9 patients presenting with an intermediate muscular dystrophy phenotype (3 patients) or a BMD-like phenotype (1 patient).

24163134,Restoration of muscle strength in dystrophic muscle by angiotensin-1-7 through inhibition of TGF-β signalling.,,Human molecular genetics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common inherited neuromuscular disease, and is characterized by the lack of dystrophin, muscle wasting, increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β Smad-dependent signalling and fibrosis. Acting via the Mas receptor, angiotensin-1-7 [Ang-(1-7)], is part of the renin-angiotensin system, with the opposite effect to that of angiotensin II. We hypothesized that the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis might protect chronically damaged tissues as in skeletal muscle of the DMD mouse model mdx. Infusion or oral administration of Ang-(1-7) in mdx mice normalized skeletal muscle architecture, decreased local fibrosis and improved muscle function in vitro and in vivo. These positive effects were mediated by the inhibition of TGF-β Smad signalling, which in turn led to reduction of the pro-fibrotic microRNA miR-21 concomitant with a reduction in the number of TCF4 expressing fibroblasts. Mdx mice infused with Mas antagonist (A-779) and mdx deficient for the Mas receptor showed highly deteriorated muscular architecture, increased fibrosis and TGF-β signalling with diminished muscle strength. These results suggest that this novel compound Ang-(1-7) might be used to improve quality of life and delay death in individuals with DMD and this drug should be investigated in further pre-clinical trials.",,,,2013-10-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A study was carried out on 150 patients diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. These included Duchenne muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy variants. They were administered autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells intrathecally and intramuscularly at the motor points of the antigravity weak muscles followed by vigorous rehabilitation therapy. No significant adverse events were noted. Assessment after transplantation showed neurological improvements in trunk muscle strength, limb strength on manual muscle testing, gait improvements, and a favorable shift on assessment scales such as the Functional Independence Measure and the Brooke and Vignos Scales. Furthermore, imaging and electrophysiological studies also showed significant changes in selective cases. On a mean follow-up of 12 ± 1 months, overall 86.67% cases showed symptomatic and functional improvements, with six patients showing changes with respect to muscle regeneration and a decrease in fatty infiltration on musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging and nine showing improved muscle electrical activity on electromyography.

There were clinical trials have shown a short-term positive effect of high-dose and daily PSL on ambulation, whereas a few study showed a long-term effect. Especially in Japan, ""real-life"" observation was lacking. We utilized the national registry of muscular dystrophy in Japan for our retrospective study. We compared the age at loss of ambulation (LOA) between patients in PSL group and those in without-PSL group. Out of 791 patients' in the Remudy DMD/BMD registry from July 2009 to June 2012, 560 were matched with inclusion criteria.

Very recently the exciting prospect of an effective oligonucleotide therapy has emerged which restores dystrophin protein expression to affected tissues in DMD patients with highly promising data from a series of clinical trials. This therapeutic approach is highly mutation specific and thus is personalised. Therefore DMD has emerged as a model genetic disorder for understanding and overcoming of the challenges of developing personalised genetic medicines. One of the greatest weaknesses of the current oligonucleotide approach is that it is a mutation-specific therapy. To address this limitation, we have recently demonstrated that exons 45-55 skipping therapy has the potential to treat clusters of mutations that cause DMD, which could significantly reduce the number of compounds that would need to be developed in order to successfully treat all DMD patients. Here we discuss and review the latest preclinical work in this area as well as a variety of accompanying issues, including efficacy and potential toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides, prior to human clinical trials.",,,,2013-08-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Molecular therapies targeting the precursor-mRNA are in clinical trials and show promising results. These approaches will depend on the stability and expression levels of dystrophin mRNA in skeletal muscles and heart. We report that the DMD gene is more highly expressed in heart than in skeletal muscles, in mice and humans. The transcript mutated in the mdx mouse model shows a 5' to 3' imbalance compared with that of its wild-type counterpart and reading frame restoration via antisense-mediated exon skipping does not correct this event. We also report significant transcript instability in 22 patients with Becker dystrophy, clarifying the fact that transcript imbalance is not caused by premature nonsense mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that transcript stability, rather than transcriptional rate, is an important determinant of dystrophin protein levels in patients with Becker dystrophy. We suggest that the availability of the complete transcript is a key factor to determine protein abundance and thus will influence the outcome of mRNA-targeting therapies.",,,,2013-08-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The collection of 70,000 clinical data for 600 patients with an average longitudinal follow-up of 12years enabled clarification of the natural history of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies and clinical presentations in symptomatic females. We were able to specify the phenotypic heterogeneity of motor, orthopedic and respiratory involvements (severe, standard and intermediary form), of the cardiac disorder (severe, standard or absent cardiomyopathy, absence of correlation between motor and cardiac involvements), and of brain function (mental deficiency in the patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, psychopathological disorders in dystrophinopathies). Phenotypic variability did not correlate with a specific mutational spectrum. We propose a model of phenotypic analysis based on the presence or not of muscular and cardiac involvements (described by age at onset and rate of progression) and brain involvement (described by the type and the severity of the cognitive impairment and of the psychological disorders). The methodology developed for the DMD gene can be generalized and used for other databases dedicated to genetic diseases.

However, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), identifying changes in function is not straightforward. In this study, we use Rasch-transformed data to examine the responsiveness and minimal important difference (MID) of the NSAA in males with DMD receiving different corticosteroid regimes.
NSAA data were examined from 198 males (mean age at assessment was 8 y 6 mo [SD 2 y 6 mo] range 4 y-18 y; 805 assessments). Responsiveness was assessed using mean score changes (using Rasch-transformed data) between adjacent pairs of age groups, pairwise squared t-values from paired samples t-tests, and an effect size calculation. The MID was assessed using the effect size calculation and 0.5 standard deviation (SD) of mean score differences.

The present study used a double-blind placebo-controlled protocol to test eteplirsen's ability to induce dystrophin production and improve distance walked on the 6-minute walk test (6MWT).
DMD boys aged 7 to 13 years, with confirmed deletions correctable by skipping exon 51 and ability to walk 200 to 400 m on 6 MWT, were randomized to weekly intravenous infusions of 30 or 50 mg/kg/wk eteplirsen or placebo for 24 weeks (n = 4/group). Placebo patients switched to 30 or 50 mg/kg eteplirsen (n=2/group) at week 25; treatment was open label thereafter. All patients had muscle biopsies at baseline and week 48. Efficacy included dystrophin-positive fibers and distance walked on the 6MWT.
At week 24, the 30 mg/kg eteplirsen patients were biopsied, and percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers was increased to 23% of normal; no increases were detected in placebo-treated patients (p≤0.002). Even greater increases occurred at week 48 (52% and 43% in the 30 and 50 mg/kg cohorts, respectively), suggesting that dystrophin increases with longer treatment.

The development of the PUL followed a number of steps, from the systematic review and a preliminary study exploring the suitability of the existing measures, to the application of a pilot version in a multicentric setting, with Rasch analysis of the preliminary results, leading to a revised pro forma.
The PUL was specifically designed for DMD, with a conceptual framework reflecting the progression of weakness and natural history of functional decline in DMD. Modern psychometric methods were used to create a scale with robust internal reliability, validity, and hierarchical scalability; males with DMD and their families were involved iteratively throughout the process of the clinician-reported outcome assessment tool development to establish clinical meaningfulness and relevance of individual PUL items to activities of daily living.

Animal models have become increasingly important for testing new therapies prior to entering human clinical trials. The Dmd(mdx) mouse is the most widely used animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), presenting the same molecular and protein defect as seen in humans with the disease. However, this mouse is not useful for clinical trials because of its very mild phenotype. The mouse model for congenital myodystrophy type 1D, Large(myd), harbors a mutation in the glycosyltransferase Large gene and displays a severe phenotype. To help elucidate the role of the proteins dystrophin and LARGE in the organization of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in muscle sarcolemma, we generated double-mutant mice for the dystrophin and LARGE proteins. The new Dmd(mdx)/Large(myd) mouse model is viable and shows a severe phenotype that is associated with the lack of dystrophin in muscle. We tested the usefulness of our new mouse model for cell therapy by systemically injecting them with normal murine mesenchymal adipose stem cells (mASCs). We verified that the mASCs were hosted in the dystrophic muscle. The new mouse model has proven to be very useful for the study of several other therapies, because injected cells can be screened both through DNA and protein analysis.

We showed that AAV genomes encoding non-therapeutic U7 were lost from mdx dystrophic muscles within 3 weeks after intramuscular injection. In contrast, AAV genomes encoding U7ex23 restoring expression of a slightly shortened dystrophin were maintained endorsing that the arrest of the dystrophic process is crucial for maintaining viral genomes in transduced fibers. Indeed, muscles treated with low doses of AAV-U7ex23, resulting in sub-optimal exon skipping, displayed much lower titers of viral genomes, showing that sub-optimal dystrophin restoration does not prevent AAV genome loss. We also followed therapeutic viral genomes in severe dystrophic dKO mice over time after systemic treatment with scAAV9-U7ex23. Dystrophin restoration decreased significantly between 3 and 12 months in various skeletal muscles, which was correlated with important viral genome loss, except in the heart. Altogether, these data show that the success of future AAV-U7 therapy for Duchenne patients would require optimal doses of AAV-U7 to induce substantial levels of dystrophin to stabilize the treated fibers and maintain the long lasting effect of the treatment.",,,,2013-06-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To evaluate the efficacy of creatine compared to placebo for the treatment of muscle weakness in muscle diseases.
On 11 September 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, Issue 9 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2012) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of creatine used to treat muscle diseases.
RCTs or quasi-RCTs of creatine treatment compared to placebo in hereditary muscle diseases or idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.
Two authors independently applied the selection criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We obtained missing data from investigators.
A total of 14 trials, including 364 randomised participants, met the selection criteria. The risk of bias was low in most studies. Only one trial had a high risk of selection, performance and detection bias. No new studies were identified at this update.Meta-analysis of six trials in muscular dystrophies including 192 participants revealed a significant increase in muscle strength in the creatine group compared to placebo, with a mean difference of 8.47%; (95% confidence intervals (CI) 3.55 to 13.38). Pooled data of four trials including 115 participants showed that a significantly higher number of participants felt better during creatine treatment compared to placebo with a risk ratio of 4.51 (95% CI 2.33 to 8.74). One trial in 37 participants with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies also showed a significant improvement in functional performance. No trial reported any clinically relevant adverse event.In metabolic myopathies, meta-analyses of three cross-over trials including 33 participants revealed no significant difference in muscle strength. One trial reported a significant deterioration of activities of daily living (mean difference 0.54 on a 1 to 10 scale; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93) and an increase in muscle pain during high-dose creatine treatment in McArdle disease.
High quality evidence from RCTs shows that short- and medium-term creatine treatment increases muscle strength in muscular dystrophies. There is also evidence that creatine improves functional performance in muscular dystrophy and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Creatine is well tolerated in these people. High quality but limited evidence from RCTs does not show significant improvement in muscle strength in metabolic myopathies.

It aims to restore the dystrophin open reading frame by skipping exons with antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to allow production of partly functional proteins. The approach is currently tested in phase 3 clinical trials, but dosing and maintenance regimens have not yet been well studied. This study compared pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of different 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA AON dosing and maintenance regimens in the preclinical mdx mouse model. When comparing different dosing regimens over a period of 8 weeks, higher levels of AON, exon skipping, and protein were observed in muscle after low daily doses compared with large weekly doses. Secondly, after receiving a high loading dose (1,250 mg/kg) in the first week, mice treated with maintenance injections twice weekly for 8 weeks showed higher preservation of therapeutic effects than mice receiving less or no maintenance injections. In both cases, the regimen resulting in the highest AON and exon skipping levels in muscle also resulted in high AON levels in liver and kidneys.

Both conditions are fatal and no clinically available treatments are able to significantly alter disease course in either case. However, by manipulation of pre-mRNA splicing using antisense oligonucleotides, defective transcripts from the DMD gene and from the SMN2 gene in SMA can be modified to once again produce protein and restore function. A large number of in vitro and in vivo studies have validated the applicability of this approach and an increasing number of preliminary clinical trials have either been completed or are under way. Several different oligonucleotide chemistries can be used for this purpose and various strategies are being developed to facilitate increased delivery efficiency and prolonged therapeutic effect. As these novel therapeutic compounds start to enter the clinical arena, attention must also be drawn to the question of how best to facilitate the clinical development of such personalised genetic therapies and how best to implement their provision.",,,,2013-05-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
23622373,Innovating therapies for muscle diseases.,,Handbook of clinical neurology,"The neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) involve many different genetic and acquired diseases. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone and deflazacort) are prescribed for some NMDs as a palliative treatment to slow down disease progression to some extent. For the vast majority of NMDs, no specific therapy is currently available that stops progression or reverses the clinical deficits of the diseases. However, recent progress with different therapeutic approaches is now resulting in numerous clinical trials. In this chapter, we give an overview of the current state of the art, opportunities and challenges for gene therapy, cell therapy, antisense-mediated modulation of splicing, and numerous drug therapies for NMDs in general, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy as a paradigm in particular. Although none of the proposed strategies has yet proven to be of therapeutic value in patients, it is reasonable to expect that clinical efficacy will soon be demonstrated for some of the more advanced approaches.",,,,2013-04-30,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, it is difficult to obtain adequate numbers of patients in clinical trials. As solutions to these problems, patient registries are an important resource worldwide, especially in rare diseases such as DMD/BMD.
We developed a national registry of Japanese DMD/BMD patients in collaboration with TREAT-NMD. The registry includes male Japanese DMD/BMD patients whose genetic status has been confirmed by genetic analysis. The registry includes patients throughout Japan.
As of February 2012, 583 DMD and 105 BMD patients were registered. Most individuals aged less than 20 years. In terms of genetic mutations of registrants of DMD and BMD, deletion of exons was the most frequent (61.4% and 79.0%) followed by point mutations (24.5% and 14.3%) and duplications (13.6% and 4.8%), respectively. 43.6% of DMD are capable of walking, and 76.2% of BMD registrants are able to walk. 41.1% of DMD registrants in the database were treated using steroids. 29.5% of DMD and 23.8% of BMD registrants were prescribed one cardiac medicine at least. 22% of DMD used ventilator support, and non-invasive support was common. Small numbers of DMD and BMD registrants, only 3.9% and 1.0% of them, have received scoliosis surgery. 57 (9.8%) patients were eligible to clinical trial focused on 'skipping' exon 51.

There were no studies with high levels of evidence (randomised or other controlled trials). The studies with the highest level of evidence were non-randomised experimental trials. There is some evidence that children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who receive steroid therapy might have delayed onset of scoliosis, but more evidence is required about the long-term risks versus benefits of this intervention.

Complete loss of muscle dystrophin protein causes progressive muscle weakness and heart and respiratory failure, leading to premature death. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that bind to complementary sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA to induce skipping of the targeted exon by modulating pre-mRNA splicing are promising therapeutic agents for DMD. Such AONs can restore the open reading frame of the DMD gene and produce internally deleted, yet partially functional dystrophin protein isoforms in skeletal muscle. Within the last few years, clinical trials using AONs have made considerable progress demonstrating the restoration of functional dystrophin protein and acceptable safety profiles following both local and systemic delivery in DMD patients. However, improvement of AON delivery and efficacy, along with the development of multiple AONs to treat as many DMD patients as possible needs to be addressed for this approach to fulfill its potential.

23498916,"VBP15: preclinical characterization of a novel anti-inflammatory delta 9,11 steroid.",,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Δ9,11 modifications of glucocorticoids (21-aminosteroids) have been developed as drugs for protection against cell damage (lipid peroxidation; lazaroids) and inhibition of neovascularization (anecortave). Part of the rationale for developing these compounds has been the loss of glucocorticoid receptor binding due to the Δ9,11 modification, thus avoiding many immunosuppressive activities and deleterious side effect profiles associated with binding to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. We recently demonstrated that anecortave acetate and its 21-hydroxy analog (VBP1) do, in fact, show glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor binding activities, with potent translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor to the cell nucleus. We concluded that Δ9,11 steroids showed novel anti-inflammatory properties, retaining NF-κB inhibition, but losing deleterious glucocorticoid side effect profiles. Evidence for this was developed in pre-clinical trials of chronic muscle inflammation. Here, we describe a drug development program aimed at optimizing the Δ9,11 chemistry. Twenty Δ9,11 derivatives were tested in in vitro screens for NF-κB inhibition and GR translocation to the nucleus, and low cell toxicity. VBP15 was selected as the lead compound due to potent NF-κB inhibition and GR translocation similar to prednisone and dexamethasone, lack of transactivation properties, and good bioavailability. Phamacokinetics were similar to traditional glucocorticoid drugs with terminal half-life of 0.35 h (mice), 0.58 h (rats), 5.42 h (dogs), and bioavailability of 74.5% (mice), and 53.2% (dogs). Metabolic stability showed ≥80% remaining at 1 h of VBP6 and VBP15 in human, dog, and monkey liver microsomes. Solubility, permeability and plasma protein binding were within acceptable limits.

Subsequent efforts to standardize care for DMD indicated wide variation in corticosteroid use.
We surveyed physicians who follow patients with DMD, including: (1) clinics in the TREAT-NMD (Translational Research in Europe-Assessment and Treatment of Neuromuscular Diseases) network (predominantly Europe) and (2) U.S. MDA clinic directors. We also documented the co-administered corticosteroids in a trial of a putative treatment (ataluren) for DMD.
Of 105 Treat-NMD clinicians, corticosteroids were not used in 10 clinics, and 29 different regimens were used--the most frequent 0.75 mg/kg/day prednisone (61 centers); 10 days on/10 days off (36 centers); 0.9 mg/kg/day deflazacort (32 centers); and 5 mg/kg/day on weekends (10 centers).

To investigate symptoms of dysphagia in DMD and to determine the potential of the validated Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) to diagnose dysphagia in this patient group.
Three participant groups completed the SSQ and the results were compared: nine DMD participants with dysphagia, six DMD participants without dysphagia and 12 healthy controls.
The questionnaire scores for dysphagic DMD participants were significantly higher than for non-dysphagic DMD participants (p = 0.039) and for healthy controls (p ≤ 0.001). The diagnostic ability of the questionnaire was good for detecting dysphagia in participants with DMD (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve = 0.89, p = 0.013), with a cut-off score of 224.5 (13.2%) giving a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.83 for determining dysphagia. Dysphagic participants rated time to eat a meal, swallowing hard food, swallowing thick liquids and needing to cough up or spit during meals with the highest severity of all questionnaire items.

Here, we describe the mdx/utrn(-/-)/Xist(Δhs) mouse model, which expresses a range of low dystrophin levels, depending on the degree of skewing of X inactivation in a utrophin-negative background. Mdx/utrn(-/-) mice develop severe muscle weakness, kyphosis, respiratory and heart failure, and premature death closely resembling DMD pathology. We show that at dystrophin levels < 4%, survival and motor function in these animals are greatly improved. In mice expressing >4% dystrophin, histopathology is ameliorated, as well.

To determine the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with scoliosis. We intended to test whether spinal surgery is effective in increasing survival, improving respiratory function, improving quality of life and overall functioning; and whether spinal surgery is associated with severe adverse effects.
We searched the specialized registers of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group (31 July 2012), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1947 to July 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 7 in the Cochrane Library), CINAHL Plus(January 1937 to July 2012), Proquest Dissertation and Thesis Database (January 1980 to July 2012), and the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database (July 2012). No language restrictions were imposed.
We planned to include controlled clinical trials using random or quasi-random allocation of treatment evaluating all forms of spinal surgery for scoliosis in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the review. The control interventions would have been no treatment, non-operative treatment, or a different form of spinal surgery.
Two authors independently examined the search results and evaluated the study characteristics against inclusion criteria to decide which ones would be included in the review.
On searching, 47 studies were relevant but none met the inclusion criteria for the review, because they were not clinical trials but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series.
Since there were no randomized controlled clinical trials available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, no evidence-based recommendation can be made for clinical practice. People with scoliosis should be informed about the uncertainty of benefits and potential risks of surgery for scoliosis.

We treated 2 different dystrophic mouse models which have an associated cardiomyopathy (mdx: model for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and Sgcd-/-: model for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F) and wild type controls (C57 Bl10) with the beta blocker metoprolol or placebo for 8 weeks at an early stage in the development of the cardiomyopathy. Left and right ventricular function was assessed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in-vivo myocardial calcium influx with manganese enhanced MRI. In the mdx mice at baseline there was reduced stroke volume, cardiac index, and end-diastolic volume with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. These abnormalities were no longer evident after treatment with beta-blockers. Right ventricular ejection fraction was reduced and right ventricular end-systolic volume increased in the mdx mice. With metoprolol there was an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. Left and right ventricular function was normal in the Sgcd-/- mice. Metroprolol had no significant effects on left and right ventricular function in these mice, though heart/body weight ratios increased after treatment. In-vivo myocardial calcium influx with MEMRI was significantly elevated in both models, though metoprolol had no significant effects on either. In conclusion, metoprolol treatment at an early stage in the development of cardiomyopathy has deleterious effects on right ventricular function in mdx mice and in both models no effect on increased in-vivo calcium influx. This suggests that clinical trials need to carefully monitor not just left ventricular function but also right ventricular function and other aspects of myocardial metabolism.",,,,2013-02-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Continuous intraperitoneal administration to dystrophin-deficient mdx mice resulted in a near 2-fold increase in utrophin (protein homologous to dystrophin) in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, accompanied by an improvement of the dystrophic phenotype in both adult and newborn mice (45 and 70% decrease in creatine kinase level, respectively; 14% increase in tidal volume, 30% decrease in necrotic area in limb and 23% increase in isometric force). Intermittent administration, as performed in clinical trials, was then used to reduce the frequency of injections and to improve safety. This also enhanced utrophin level around 2-fold (EC50=284 mg/ml) and alleviated the dystrophic phenotype (inverted grid and grip test performance near to wild-type values, creatine kinase level decreased by 50%). Skin biopsies were used to monitor treatment efficacy, instead of invasive muscle biopsies, and this could be done a few days after the start of treatment. A 2-fold increase in utrophin expression was also shown in cultured human myotubes. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that the drug combination acts synergistically.

DYSF mutations lead to a wide range of muscular phenotypes, with the most prominent being Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B).
We assessed the one-year-natural course of dysferlinopathy, and the safety and efficacy of deflazacort treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. After one year of natural course without intervention, 25 patients with genetically defined dysferlinopathy were randomized to receive deflazacort and placebo for six months each (1 mg/kg/day in month one, 1 mg/kg every 2nd day during months two to six) in one of two treatment sequences.
During one year of natural course, muscle strength declined about 2% as measured by CIDD (Clinical Investigation of Duchenne Dystrophy) score, and 76 Newton as measured by hand-held dynamometry. Deflazacort did not improve muscle strength. In contrast, there is a trend of worsening muscle strength under deflazacort treatment, which recovers after discontinuation of the study drug.

An alternative aim may be to disrupt the reading frame of dysfunctional proteins when they have a dominant negative effect and their absence may ameliorate disease. A third aim is to target mRNAs for other proteins, the engineering of which might improve or prevent the disease.

Nucleic acids,"Antisense-mediated exon skipping for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is currently tested in phase 3 clinical trials. The aim of this approach is to modulate splicing by skipping a specific exon to reframe disrupted dystrophin transcripts, allowing the synthesis of a partly functional dystrophin protein. Studies in animal models allow detailed analysis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). Here, we tested the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate AON at 200 mg/kg/week for up to 6 months in mouse models with varying levels of disease severity: mdx mice (mild phenotype) and mdx mice with one utrophin allele (mdx/utrn(+/-); more severe phenotype). Long-term treatment was well tolerated and exon skipping and dystrophin restoration confirmed for all animals. Notably, in the more severely affected mdx/utrn(+/-) mice the therapeutic effect was larger: creatine kinase (CK) levels were more decreased and rotarod running time was more increased. This suggests that the mdx/utrn(+/-) model may be a more suitable model to test potential therapies than the regular mdx mouse. Our results also indicate that long-term subcutaneous treatment in dystrophic mouse models with these AONs is safe and beneficial.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2012) 1, e44; doi:10.1038/mtna.2012.38; published online 4 September 2012.",,,,2013-01-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) measurements are easily performed by young children with neuromuscular disorders. The clinical value of SNIP in the longitudinal assessment of respiratory weakness remains to be assessed. The objective of the present study was to assess longitudinally the changes in SNIP, PImax and VC with age in DMD children. We hypothesised that their longitudinal assessment would show an earlier decline in SNIP than VC. A 3-year, prospective follow-up, at 6-month intervals of, 33 steroid-naïve, 5-20-year-old DMD patients was analysed using a linear mixed model. SNIP measurements were reliable (within-session coefficient of variation 8%). SNIP and VC increased until 10.5 and 12.5 years of age, respectively, and declined thereafter, while PImax did not change with age. SNIP was an earlier marker of decline in respiratory muscle strength (at 10.5 years) than VC (at 12.5 years) in young DMD patients.

23250964,Long-term benefits and adverse effects of intermittent versus daily glucocorticoids in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,Muscular Dystrophy,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry","To assess the current use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the UK, and compare the benefits and the adverse events of daily versus intermittent prednisolone regimens.
A prospective longitudinal observational study across 17 neuromuscular centres in the UK of 360 boys aged 3-15 years with confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were treated with daily or intermittent (10 days on/10 days off) prednisolone for a mean duration of treatment of 4 years.
The median loss of ambulation was 12 years in intermittent and 14.5 years in daily treatment; the HR for intermittent treatment was 1.57 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.82). A fitted multilevel model comparing the intermittent and daily regiments for the NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment demonstrated a divergence after 7 years of age, with boys on an intermittent regimen declining faster (p<0.001). Moderate to severe side effects were more commonly reported and observed in the daily regimen, including Cushingoid features, adverse behavioural events and hypertension. Body mass index mean z score was higher in the daily regimen (1.99, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.19) than in the intermittent regimen (1.51, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.75). Height restriction was more severe in the daily regimen (mean z score -1.77, 95% CI -1.79 to -2.19) than in the intermittent regimen (mean z score -0.70, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.49).
Our study provides a framework for providing information to patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and their families when introducing GC therapy. The study also highlights the importance of collecting longitudinal natural history data on patients treated according to standardised protocols, and clearly identifies the benefits and the side-effect profile of two treatment regimens, which will help with informed choices and implementation of targeted surveillance.",,"The median loss of ambulation was 12 years in intermittent and 14.5 years in daily treatment; the HR for intermittent treatment was 1.57 (95% CI 0.87 to 2.82).

In this study, we evaluated the effects of commercially available fish oil containing EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on mdx.
Mdx mice (14 days old) were treated with fish oil (FDC Vitamins; 0.002 g EPA and 0.001 g DHA) for 16 days by gavage. Control mdx mice received mineral oil (Nujol). Grip strength measurement was used for functional evaluation. The sternomastoid, diaphragm and biceps brachii muscles were removed and processed for histopathology and Western blot analysis.
Fish oil decreased creatine kinase and myonecrosis. In all muscles studied, the inflammatory area was significantly reduced after treatment (18.0 ± 3.0% inflammatory area in untreated mdx mice versus 4.0 ± 1% in treated mdx mice). Fish oil protected against the loss of muscle strength. Fish oil significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α and the levels of 4-HNE-protein adducts (30-34% reduction for both) in all muscles studied.

23197572,Tadalafil alleviates muscle ischemia in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy.,,Science translational medicine,"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a progressive X-linked muscle wasting disease for which there is no treatment. Like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), BMD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a structural cytoskeletal protein that also targets other proteins to the muscle sarcolemma. Among these is neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ), which requires certain spectrin-like repeats in dystrophin's rod domain and the adaptor protein α-syntrophin to be targeted to the sarcolemma. When healthy skeletal muscle is subjected to exercise, sarcolemmal nNOSμ-derived NO attenuates local α-adrenergic vasoconstriction, thereby optimizing perfusion of muscle. We found previously that this protective mechanism is defective-causing functional muscle ischemia-in dystrophin-deficient muscles of the mdx mouse (a model of DMD) and of children with DMD, in whom nNOSμ is mislocalized to the cytosol instead of the sarcolemma. We report that this protective mechanism also is defective in men with BMD in whom the most common dystrophin mutations disrupt sarcolemmal targeting of nNOSμ. In these men, the vasoconstrictor response, measured as a decrease in muscle oxygenation, to reflex sympathetic activation is not appropriately attenuated during exercise of the dystrophic muscles. In a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial, we show that functional muscle ischemia is alleviated and normal blood flow regulation is fully restored in the muscles of men with BMD by boosting NO-cGMP (guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate) signaling with a single dose of the drug tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5A inhibitor. These results further support an essential role for sarcolemmal nNOSμ in the normal modulation of sympathetic vasoconstriction in exercising human skeletal muscle and implicate the NO-cGMP pathway as a putative new target for treating BMD.",,,,2012-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The aim of this study is to assess if such a treatment could have an effect on the disease course of these animals. Seven GRMD dogs were treated with an association of cyclosporine A (immunosuppressive dosage) and prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) during 7 months, from 2 to 9 months of age. A multi-parametric evaluation was performed during this period which allowed us to demonstrate that this treatment had several significant effects on the disease progression. The gait quality as assessed by 3D-accelerometry was dramatically improved. This was consistent with the evolution of other parameters towards a significant improvement, such as the clinical motor score, the post-tetanic relaxation and the serum CK levels. In contrast the isometric force measurement as well as the histological evaluation argued in favor of a more severe disease progression. In view of the disease modifying effects which have been observed in this study it should be concluded that immunosuppressive treatments should be used with caution when carrying out pre-clinical studies in this canine model of DMD. They also highlight the importance of using a large range of multi-parametric evaluation tools to reliably draw any conclusion from trials involving dystrophin-deficient dogs, which reproduce the complexity of the human disease.",,,,2012-11-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
23179024,Dysphagia in Duchenne muscular dystrophy assessed objectively by surface electromyography.,,Dysphagia,"Objective swallowing assessment is indicated in the management of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a non-invasive, objective method of quantifying muscle activity. It was hypothesised that the measurement of sEMG activity during swallowing would distinguish between preserved and disordered swallow function in DMD. This comparative study investigated the peak, duration, and relative timing of muscle activity during swallowing of four muscle groups: orbicularis oris, masseter, submental, and infrahyoid. The study included three groups of participants: Nine DMD patients with dysphagia (mean age = 21.7 ± 4.2 years), six DMD patients with preserved swallow function (21.0 ± 3.0 years), and 12 healthy controls (24.8 ± 3.1 years). Dysphagic DMD participants produced significantly higher normalised peak amplitude measurements than the healthy control group for masseter (61.77 vs. 5.07; p ≤ 0.01) and orbicularis oris muscles (71.87 vs. 26.22; p ≤ 0.05). Intrasubject variability for masseter peak amplitude was significantly greater for dysphagic DMD participants than the other groups (16.01 vs. 5.86 vs. 2.18; p ≤ 0.05). There were no differences in timing measurements between groups. Different characteristic sEMG waveforms were observed for the three groups. sEMG provides useful physiological information for the evaluation of swallowing in DMD patients, justifying further study.",,,,2012-11-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
23168016,Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells injected systemically into GRMD dogs without immunosuppression are able to reach the host muscle and express human dystrophin.,,Cell transplantation,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal X-linked disorder, is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophies, affecting 1 in 3,500 male births. Mutations in the DMD gene lead to the absence of muscle dystrophin and a progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle. The possibility to treat DMD through cell therapy has been widely investigated. We have previously shown that human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) injected systemically in SJL mice are able to reach and engraft in the host muscle, express human muscle proteins, and ameliorate the functional performance of injected animals without any immunosuppression. However, before starting clinical trials in humans many questions still need to be addressed in preclinical studies, in particular in larger animal models, when available. The best animal model to address these questions is the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dog that reproduces the full spectrum of human DMD. Affected animals carry a mutation that predicts a premature termination codon in exon 8 and a peptide that is 5% the size of normal dystrophin. These dogs present clinical signs within the first weeks and most of them do not survive beyond age two. Here we show the results of local and intravenous injections of hASCs into GRMD dogs, without immunosuppression. We observed that hASCs injected systemically into the dog cephalic vein are able to reach, engraft, and express human dystrophin in the host GRMD dystrophic muscle up to 6 months after transplantation. Most importantly, we demonstrated that injecting a huge quantity of human mesenchymal cells in a large-animal model, without immunosuppression, is a safe procedure, which may have important applications for future therapy in patients with different forms of muscular dystrophies.",,,,2012-11-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

23140454,Cell penetrating peptide delivery of splice directing oligonucleotides as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Current pharmaceutical design,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe, X-linked muscle wasting disorder caused by the absence of an integral structural protein called dystrophin. This is caused by mutations or deletions in the dystrophin gene which disrupt the reading frame, thereby halting the production of a functional protein. A number of potential therapies have been investigated for the treatment of this disease including utrophin upregulation, 'stop-codon read through' aminoglycosides and adeno-associated virus gene replacement as well as stem cell therapy. However, the most promising treatment to date is the use of antisense oligonucleotides which cause exon skipping by binding to a specific mRNA sequence, skipping the desired exon, thereby restoring the reading frame and producing a truncated yet functional protein. The results from recent 2'OMePS and morpholino clinical trials have renewed hope for Duchenne patients; however in vivo studies in a mouse model, mdx, have revealed low systemic distribution and poor delivery of oligonucleotides to affected tissues such as the brain and heart. However a variety of cell penetrating peptides directly conjugated to antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to enhance delivery in Duchenne model systems with improved systemic distribution and greater efficacy compared to 'naked' antisense oligonucleotides. These cell penetrating peptides, combined with an optimised dose and dosing regimen, as well as thorough toxicity profile have the potential to be developed into a promising treatment which may be progressed to clinical trial.",,,,2012-11-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Twenty patients with genetically confirmed DMD were recruited. Physical assessment was performed using the motor function measurement (MFM) scale. Axial 3T MRI scans of the thighs were acquired using T1-weighted in- and opposed-phase images (TR = 20 ms, TE1 = 2.45 ms, TE2 = 3.68 ms, flip angle = 15°) to calculate the relative fat fraction according to the two-point Dixon method in the knee extensors, flexors, and adductor muscles. The average MFM was 65.3 % and correlated negatively to age (r (2) = 0.60). Overall mean fat fraction correlated positively to age (r (2) = 0.51-0.64). An average of 5 % increase in mean fat fraction per year was calculated. Mean fat fraction of the quadriceps showed a high negative correlation (r (2) = 0.93) to the D1 (standing position and transfers) component of the MFM. A cutoff for mean fat fraction of 50 % predicted loss of ambulation with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 91 %.

Currently no curative treatment exists for DMD. In a Phase II randomized placebo-controlled study (DELPHI) in 21 DMD boys at age 8-16 years, idebenone (450 mg/d) showed trends of efficacy for cardiac and respiratory endpoints. Since the DELPHI study population comprised both glucocorticoid-naïve subjects and glucocorticoid-users, we now report a post-hoc analysis investigating the effects of glucocorticoids and idebenone on markers of respiratory weakness, particularly peak expiratory flow (PEF) percent predicted (PEF%p). Baseline values of PEF%p correlated well with the percent predicted values for maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (MIP%p), forced vital capacity (FVC%p), and forced expired volume in 1 sec (FEV1%p). Baseline PEF%p and FVC%p were significantly higher in patients on concomitant glucocorticoids compared to glucocorticoid-naïve patients. In the latter subgroup, idebenone caused a 8.0 ± 12.1% improvement in PEF%p, whilst patients on placebo declined by -12.3 ± 17.9% (P < 0.05) in the course of the 12 month study. In patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoids, PEF%p remained stable (-0.4 ± 14.6%) in the idebenone group compared to a decline by -6.2 ± 12.4% (P = 0.24) in the placebo group. Idebenone showed a trend for efficacy on FVC%p only in glucocorticoid-naïve patients. Because of the study limitations, these data are exploratory and preclude any firm conclusions. In conclusion, PEF appears to be a sensitive respiratory function parameter that could be a valid and clinically relevant endpoint in intervention studies in DMD. In DELPHI the effect size of idebenone on PEF%p was significantly larger in steroid-naive patients, possibly indicating a maximum treatment effect reached by steroids or steroid-mediated suppression of idebenone's effects. The impact of standard care glucocorticoids on respiratory function will have to be considered in the planning of future interventional trials in DMD.",,,,2012-11-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

23104273,Contribution of oxidative stress to pathology in diaphragm and limb muscles with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Journal of muscle research and cell motility,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative skeletal muscle disease that makes walking and breathing difficult. DMD is caused by an X-linked (Xp21) mutation in the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin is a scaffolding protein located in the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton, important in maintaining structural integrity and regulating muscle cell (muscle fiber) growth and repair. Dystrophin deficiency in mouse models (e.g., mdx mouse) destabilizes the interface between muscle fibers and the extracellular matrix, resulting in profound damage, inflammation, and weakness in diaphragm and limb muscles. While the link between dystrophin deficiency with inflammation and pathology is multi-factorial, elevated oxidative stress has been proposed as a central mediator. Unfortunately, the use of non-specific antioxidant scavengers in mouse and human studies has led to inconsistent results, obscuring our understanding of the importance of redox signaling in pathology of muscular dystrophy. However, recent studies with more mechanistic approaches in mdx mice suggest that NAD(P)H oxidase and nuclear factor-kappaB are important in amplifying dystrophin-deficient muscle pathology. Therefore, more targeted antioxidant therapeutics may ameliorate damage and weakness in human population, thus promoting better muscle function and quality of life. This review will focus upon the pathobiology of dystrophin deficiency in diaphragm and limb muscle primarily in mouse models, with a rationale for development of targeted therapeutic antioxidants in DMD patients.",,,,2012-10-30,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Several such RNA-based gene therapy approaches are in clinical development in which all studies to date have assessed AO efficacy by semiquantitative nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Precise evaluation of dystrophin protein levels is complex and hindered by the large size and low abundance of dystrophin; thus an accurate and standardized measurement of DMD exon skipping at the RNA level remains important to assess and compare patient responses in DMD exon skipping clinical trials. Here we describe the development of a Taqman quantitative (q)RT-PCR assay to quantify exon skipping and highlight its use to determine the levels of exon skipping in DMD patients treated intramuscularly with a morpholino AO to skip exon 51, eteplirsen (AVI-4658). The muscle biopsies of these patients were previously thoroughly characterized, providing a valuable benchmark for the evaluation of novel methodology. We demonstrate that levels of dystrophin protein restoration, and thus patient response, correlate accurately with the RNA level. Furthermore, this sensitive assay detects revertant exon 51 skipped fibers in untreated biopsies, providing an important baseline to precisely quantify treatment success. This study represents the first quantitative assessment of exon skipping in a clinical trial setting.

Here, we investigate the ability to automatically distinguish a mental arithmetic (MA) task from a natural baseline state in an individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using signals acquired via multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Using dual-wavelength NIRS, we interrogated nine sites around the frontopolar locations while the individual performed MA to answer multiple-choice questions within a system-paced paradigm.

To date, little is known about the effect of mesoangioblasts on human immune cells and vice versa. We hypothesized that mesoangioblasts could modulate the function of immune cells in a similar manner to mesenchymal stromal cells. Human mesoangioblasts did not evoke, but rather potently suppressed human T-cell proliferation and effector function in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, mesoangioblasts exert these inhibitory effects uniformly on human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a reversible manner without inducing a state of anergy. Interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α play crucial roles in the initial activation of mesoangioblasts. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE) were identified as key mechanisms of action involved in the mesoangioblast suppression of T-cell proliferation.

Years of research have come to fruition during the past 18 months with publications on clinical trials for several gene therapy approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This review covers the present status of these approaches.
The exon skipping approach is most advanced in the process of clinical application. Encouraging results have been obtained in two systemic clinical trials and further optimization has increased delivery to the heart in animal models. Limitations of the approach are the mutation-specificity and the anticipated requirement for lifelong treatment. Gene therapy by means of gene transfer holds the promise of more long-lasting effects. Results of a first, early-stage gene therapy trial, using viral vectors to deliver a minidystrophin gene, were reported. Animal studies suggest that it may be possible to overcome the main challenges currently facing gene therapy (immunogenicity of the vector and systemic body-wide delivery).

We aimed to identify early changes of cardiac abnormalities in children with DMD by technetium 99m-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) gated myocardial perfusion imaging (GMPI). Forty-three boys aged 3 to 14 years (mean age 8.2±3.6 years) with DMD and 12 age-matched normal boys as control were studied by G-MPI. These patients were at early stage according to previous studies on DMD. Uptake of (99m)Tc-MIBI in 7 regional walls and 17 segments of the left ventricle were visually analyzed. Quantitative gated single photon emission tomography (QGSSPET) analysis of myocardium was performed to evaluate left ventricular function (LVEF). Gated myocardial perfusion imaging revealed cardiac abnormalities in 81.4% of all patients. Regional perfusion decrease involving multiple walls of LV was present. Four of the patients demonstrated mild abnormalities (11.4%), 7 moderate (20.0%) and 24 severe abnormalities (68.6%). Evident LV ejection fraction (EF) decrease (42.1±6.4%) and dilation with globally poor perfusion were found in three patients, aged 10 to 14, which had significant difference compared with the control group (EF=58.4±4.7%, P=0.001). The rest cases, aged 3 to 9 years, had normal LVF. In conclusion, from the 35 cases of DMD patients (aged 3 to 14 years), regional myocardial perfusion decrease was detected in multiple walls by (99m)Tc-MIBI G-MPI at an early stage, while left ventricular function decrease (3/35, 8.6%) appeared late at about 10 years of age or older as compared with the control group in this study.",,,,2012-07-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Exon skipping therapy is a leading therapeutic strategy being investigated for the treatment of this devastating genetic disease. AONs targeting exon 51 have progressed furthest in human clinical trials. Exon 51 skipping is applicable to a variety of dystrophin defects found in different patients. Due to the differences in original defect, the end result of the therapy will be different in each case. An open question is whether these differences will produce significant differences in the dystrophin protein so edited.

This study was conducted on a cohort of ambulatory patients with DMD from a network of Italian neuromuscular centers, evaluated longitudinally with the north star ambulatory assessment (NSAA) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) at study entry and after 12 months. Genotype at rs28357094 was determined after completion of the clinical evaluations. Patients were stratified in 2 groups according to a dominant model (TT homozygotes vs TG heterozygotes and GG homozygotes) and clinical data were retrospectively compared between groups.
Eighty patients were selected (age 4.1-19.3 years; mean 8.3 ± 2.7 SD). There were no differences in age or steroid treatment between the 2 subgroups. Paired t test showed a significant difference in both NSAA (p = 0.013) and 6MWT (p = 0.03) between baseline and follow-up after 12 months in patients with DMD carrying the G allele. The difference was not significant in the T subgroup. The analysis of covariance using age and baseline values as covariate and SPP1 genotype as fixed effect showed that these parameters are significantly correlated with the 12-month values.

Diagnosis was: cerebral palsy (13 cases), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (7), spinal amyotrophy (7), myelomeningocele (5), poliomyelitis (3), Friedreich's ataxia (2), Escobar syndrome (2), Steinert's disease (1), Charcot Marie Tooth disease (1). Main scoliosis Cobb angle averaged 94.05° (range, 34° to 165°), the curve was thoracic in 19 cases, thoracolumbar or lumbar in 22 cases. Kyphosis (T5-T12) averaged 42.86° (range, 7° to 90°), lordosis was 33.57°. The fusion was extended to the lumbar tract in 23 patients, to the sacrum in the other 18. Our results showed that, in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis, posterior instrumented fusion is a safe and effective procedure and is the treatment of choice for patients with limited respiratory function, as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy.

An established animal model of DMD is the mdx mouse, which is unable to express dystrophin. Inflammation, particularly the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), strongly contributes to necrosis in the dystrophin-deficient fibers of the mdx mice and in DMD. In this study we investigated whether the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreases TNF-α levels and protects the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice against necrosis.
Mdx mice (14 days old) received daily intraperitoneal injections of NAC for 14 days, followed by removal of the diaphragm muscle. Control mdx mice were injected with saline.
NAC reduced TNF-α and 4-HNE-protein adducts levels, inflammation, creatine kinase levels, and myonecrosis in diaphragm muscle.
NAC may be used as a complementary treatment for dystrophinopathies.

Phase 2 clinical trials in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have reported induction of dystrophin expression in muscle of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients by systemic administration of both phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) and 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino offers significantly higher efficiency than phosphorodiamidate morpholino, with the ability to induce near-normal levels of dystrophin, and restores function in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. We examined 1-year systemic efficacy of peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino targeting exon 23 in dystrophic mdx mice. The LD(50) of peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino was determined to be approximately 85 mg/kg. The half-life of dystrophin expression was approximately 2 months in skeletal muscle, but shorter in cardiac muscle. Biweekly injection of 6 mg/kg peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino produced >20% dystrophin expression in all skeletal muscles and ≤5% in cardiac muscle, with improvement in muscle function and pathology and reduction in levels of serum creatine kinase. Monthly injections of 30 mg/kg peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino restored dystrophin to >50% normal levels in skeletal muscle, and 15% in cardiac muscle. This was associated with greatly reduced serum creatine kinase levels, near-normal histology, and functional improvement of skeletal muscle.

This study aimed to examine emotional impact on participants in a paediatric exon-skipping trial.
Nineteen male children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and their parents, taking part in a dose-ranging study of an i.v. administered morpholino splice-switching oligomer (which can restore the reading frame in DMD and induce dystrophin expression) underwent a psychosocial/psychiatric examination at trial entry. Emotional impact was assessed at trial completion using questionnaires.
The mean child age was 8.9 years (SD 2.1); 13(68%) were attending mainstream school. Most families were well adjusted psychosocially at trial entry. Post-trial median child emotional impact scores were 5/10 (n= 18), but impact was rated as positive by 6/14 (42%), neutral/mixed by 5 (35%) and negative by 3 (21%). Median post-trial psychosocial/psychiatric change scores in children and parents were minimal. Actual post-trial negative impact was statistically significantly associated with higher expected impact at trial entry, at which time the families of the three children displaying actual negative impact reported higher family stress levels in combination with a variety of other psychosocial risks factors.
In carefully selected families with low levels of psychosocial stress/distress at trial entry, and with good support from paediatric research units (including psychiatric input when required), genetic trials in progressive disorders such as DMD can have a predominantly positive or neutral emotional impact.

22647146,Genetic therapeutic approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Human gene therapy,"Despite an expansive wealth of research following the discovery of the DMD gene 25 years ago, there is still no curative treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, there are currently many promising lines of research, including cell-based therapies and pharmacological reagents to upregulate dystrophin via readthrough of nonsense mutations or by upregulation of the dystrophin homolog utrophin. Here we review genetic-based therapeutic strategies aimed at the amelioration of the DMD phenotype. These include the reintroduction of a copy of the DMD gene into an affected tissue by means of a viral vector; correction of the mutated DMD transcript by antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping to restore the open reading frame; and direct modification of the DMD gene at a chromosomal level through genome editing. All these approaches are discussed in terms of the more recent advances, and the hurdles to be overcome if a comprehensive and effective treatment for DMD is to be found. These hurdles include the need to target all musculature of the body. Therefore any potential treatment would need to be administered systemically. In addition, any treatment needs to have a long-term effect, with the possibility of readministration, while avoiding any potentially detrimental immune response to the vector or transgene.",,,,2012-06-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The workshop was organized in response to a September 2009 European Medicines Agency meeting where a clear directive was given that an international consensus needs to be developed that provides a foundation for age-appropriate clinical outcome measures for use in clinical trials of emerging therapeutics for DMD. Data were presented from eight multicenter longitudinal datasets, representing nearly 1900 patients over a 20-year time period. This experience confirmed the feasibility of repeated evaluations performed at multiple sites and addressed several core issues in drug development for DMD, such as the 'new' natural history in the steroidera, reliability and sensitivity of specific outcome measures, as well as disease staging and patient selection. These data form a valuable asset for academic investigators, pharmaceutical sponsors and regulatory agencies involved in DMD therapeutics.

Treatment is limited to glucocorticoids that have the benefit of prolonging ambulation by approximately 2 years and preventing scoliosis. Finding a more satisfactory treatment should focus on maintaining long-term efficacy with a minimal side effect profile.
Authors discuss different therapeutic strategies that have been used in pre-clinical and clinical settings.
Multiple treatment approaches have emerged. Most attractive are molecular-based therapies that can express the missing dystrophin protein (exon skipping or mutation suppression) or a surrogate gene product (utrophin). Other approaches include increasing the strength of muscles (myostatin inhibitors), reducing muscle fibrosis and decreasing oxidative stress. Additional targets include inhibiting NF-κB to reduce inflammation or promoting skeletal muscle blood flow and muscle contractility using phosphodiesterase inhibitors or nitric oxide (NO) donors. The potential for each of these treatment strategies to enter clinical trials is a central theme of discussion. The review emphasizes that the goal of treatment should be to find a product at least as good as glucocorticoids with a lower side effect profile or with a significant glucocorticoid sparing effect.",,,,2012-05-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Exon skipping is targeted at the pre-mRNA level allowing one or more exons to be omitted to restore the reading frame. In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), clinical trials have been performed with two different oligomers, a 2'O-methyl-ribo-oligonucleoside-phosphorothioate (2'OMe) and a phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO). Both have demonstrated early evidence of efficacy. A second molecular approach involves suppression of stop codons to promote readthrough of the DMD gene. We have been able to establish proof of principle for mutation suppression using the aminoglycoside, gentamicin. A safer, orally administered, alternative agent referred to as Ataluren (PTC124) has been used in clinical trials and is currently under consideration for approval by the FDA. Using a gene therapy approach, we have completed two trials and have initiated a third. For DMD, we used a mini-dystrophin transferred in adeno-associated virus (AAV). In this trial an immune response was seen directed against transgene product, a quite unexpected outcome that will help guide further studies. For limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2D (alpha-sarcoglycan deficiency), the transgene was again transferred using AAV but in this study, a muscle specific creatine kinase promoter controlled gene expression that persisted for six months. A third gene therapy trial has been initiated with transfer of the follistatin gene in AAV directly to the quadriceps muscle. Two diseases with selective quadriceps muscle weakness are undergoing gene transfer including sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that abrogation of myostatin/ActRIIB signaling ameliorates pathology and function of dystrophic muscle in animal models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Therapeutic trials in healthy man and muscular dystrophy patients suggest feasibility of blockade strategies for potential clinical use. However, many key questions on the effect of myostatin/ActRIIB blockade remain unresolved; such as the underlying molecular mechanism that triggers muscle growth, the effect on muscle regeneration and adult muscle stem cell regulation and whether it causes long term metabolic alterations. Current therapeutic strategies aim to systemically abrogate myostatin/ActRIIB signaling. Although this ensures widespread effect on musculature, it also interferes with ActRIIB signaling in other tissues than skeletal muscle, thereby risking adverse effects.

DMD is one of the most devastating genetically linked neuromuscular diseases for which there is currently no cure. Most clinical studies for DMD utilize a standard protocol for measurement exploring pathophysiology, muscle strength and timed tasks. However, we propose that examining broader components of health as emphasized by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY) may be of great value to children and their families, and important outcomes for future clinical trials.
Fifty boys with DMD and 25 unaffected age-matched boys completed two self-report measures: the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment and the Pediatric Quality of Life InventoryTM 4.0. We investigated differences between the two groups with regard to participation in life activities and perceived quality of life (QoL). Additionally, we compared participation in activities and QoL in both cohorts of younger and older boys.
Participation in physical activities was significantly lower in boys with DMD than unaffected boys. Perceived QoL was markedly diminished in children with DMD relative to unaffected controls, except in the emotional domain. The amount of time boys engage in an activity, as well as participation in social activities, declined for our older boys with DMD but no changes were observed for our older unaffected boys. For both groups, QoL remained constant over time.
The ICF-CY provides a conceptual framework and specific terminology that facilitates investigation of the consequences of impairment in children and youth. Our study is one of the first to explore participation in a cohort of boys with DMD. It was not surprising that activities of choice for boys with DMD were less physical in nature than unaffected boys their age, but the consequences of less social engagement as the boys with DMD age is of great concern. Results from our study underscore the need to further evaluate activities that children elect to participate in, with special emphasis on facilitators and barriers to participation and how participation changes throughout the course of a disease.",,"Participation in physical activities was significantly lower in boys with DMD than unaffected boys.

22533380,Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: progress and challenges.,,Current gene therapy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common childhood neuromuscular disorder. It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that disrupt the open reading frame (ORF) preventing the production of functional dystrophin protein. The loss of dystrophin ultimately leads to the degeneration of muscle fibres, progressive weakness and premature death. Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) targeted to splicing elements within DMD pre-mRNA can induce the skipping of targeted exons, restoring the ORF and the consequent production of a shorter but functional dystrophin protein. This approach may lead to an effective disease modifying treatment for DMD and progress towards clinical application has been rapid. Less than a decade has passed between the first studies published in 1998 describing the use of AOs to modify the DMD gene in mice and the results of the first intramuscular proof of concept clinical trials. Whilst phase II and III trials are now underway, the heterogeneity of DMD mutations, efficient systemic delivery and targeting of AOs to cardiac muscle remain significant challenges.

22495301,Hsp72 preserves muscle function and slows progression of severe muscular dystrophy.,,Nature,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe and progressive muscle wasting disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the absence of the membrane-stabilizing protein dystrophin. Dystrophin-deficient muscle fibres are fragile and susceptible to an influx of Ca(2+), which activates inflammatory and muscle degenerative pathways. At present there is no cure for DMD, and existing therapies are ineffective. Here we show that increasing the expression of intramuscular heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) preserves muscle strength and ameliorates the dystrophic pathology in two mouse models of muscular dystrophy. Treatment with BGP-15 (a pharmacological inducer of Hsp72 currently in clinical trials for diabetes) improved muscle architecture, strength and contractile function in severely affected diaphragm muscles in mdx dystrophic mice. In dko mice, a phenocopy of DMD that results in severe spinal curvature (kyphosis), muscle weakness and premature death, BGP-15 decreased kyphosis, improved the dystrophic pathophysiology in limb and diaphragm muscles and extended lifespan. We found that the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA, the main protein responsible for the removal of intracellular Ca(2+)) is dysfunctional in severely affected muscles of mdx and dko mice, and that Hsp72 interacts with SERCA to preserve its function under conditions of stress, ultimately contributing to the decreased muscle degeneration seen with Hsp72 upregulation. Treatment with BGP-15 similarly increased SERCA activity in dystrophic skeletal muscles. Our results provide evidence that increasing the expression of Hsp72 in muscle (through the administration of BGP-15) has significant therapeutic potential for DMD and related conditions, either as a self-contained therapy or as an adjuvant with other potential treatments, including gene, cell and pharmacological therapies.",,,,2012-04-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Current AON design methods are semi-empirical, involving either trial-and-error and/or preliminary experimentations. Therefore, a rational approach to design efficient AONs to address the wide spectrum of patients' mutations is desirable. Retrospective studies have extracted many AON design variables, but they were not tested prospectively to design AONs for skipping DMD exons. Not only did the variables differ among the various studies, no numerical cutoff for each variable was inferred, which makes their use in AON design difficult. The challenge is to thus select a minimal set of key independent variables that can consistently design efficient AONs. In this prospective study, a novel set of design variables with respective cutoff values was used to design 23 novel AONs, each to skip one of nine DMD exons. Nineteen AONs were found to be efficacious in inducing specific exon skipping (83% of total), of which 14 were considered efficient (61% of total), i.e., they induced exon skipping in >25% of total transcripts. Notably, the satisfactory success rates were achieved by using only three design variables; namely, co-transcriptional binding accessibility of target site, presence of exonic splicing enhancers, and target length. Retrospective analyses revealed that the most efficient AON in every exon targeted has the lowest average cumulative position (ACP) score. Taking the prospective and retrospective studies together, we propose that design guidelines recommend using the ACP score to select the most efficient AON for each exon.",,,,2012-04-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, after systemic treatment the majority of the injected antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) will not end up in the intended tissue. This mistargeting of AONs might have detrimental effects, especially with long-term treatment and continuous accumulation of AONs. Further, even when no detrimental effects occur, mistargeted AONs are lost for exon skipping in the intended tissue. One way to reduce the amount of mistargeted AONs is by adding a peptide that specifically binds to and is taken up by the intended tissue.

Several groups have successfully induced exon skipping by AONs to reframe the mRNA in various patients carrying deletions, and phase I/II clinical trials are ongoing. The approach is based on targeting specific splicing motifs, both exonic and located on the exon borders, thus interfering with the spliceosome assembly by steric hindrance. Evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment with AONs in cells, animal models, and humans requires a sensitive, specific, and highly reproducible method. We have developed a real-time PCR-based protocol that uses the probe-based approach to recognize specific sequences internal to the target exon (exon-specific real-time assay).

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial comparing 12 months of daily treatment with PTX or placebo in corticosteroid-treated boys with DMD using a slow-release PTX formulation (~20 mg/kg/day). The primary outcome was the change in mean total quantitative muscle testing (QMT) score. Secondary outcomes included changes in QMT subscales, manual muscle strength, pulmonary function, and timed function tests. Outcomes were compared using Student t tests and a linear mixed-effects model. Adverse events (AEs) were compared using the Fisher exact test.
A total of 64 boys with DMD with a mean age of 9.9 ± 2.9 years were randomly assigned to PTX or placebo in 11 participating Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group centers. There was no significant difference between PTX and the placebo group in total QMT scores (p = 0.14) or in most of the secondary outcomes after a 12-month treatment. The use of PTX was associated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal or hematologic AEs.

22388933,Rescue of severely affected dystrophin/utrophin-deficient mice through scAAV-U7snRNA-mediated exon skipping.,,Human molecular genetics,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the absence of functional protein. Antisense-mediated exon skipping is one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of DMD and recent clinical trials have demonstrated encouraging results. However, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping for DMD still faces major hurdles such as extremely low efficacy in the cardiac muscle, poor cellular uptake and relatively rapid clearance from circulation, which means that repeated administrations are required to achieve some therapeutic efficacy. To overcome these limitations, we previously proposed the use of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), especially U7snRNA to shuttle the antisense sequences after vectorization into adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. In this study, we report for the first time the efficiency of the AAV-mediated exon skipping approach in the utrophin/dystrophin double-knockout (dKO) mouse which is a very severe and progressive mouse model of DMD. Following a single intravenous injection of scAAV9-U7ex23 in dKO mice, near-normal levels of dystrophin expression were restored in all muscles examined, including the heart. This resulted in a considerable improvement of their muscle function and dystrophic pathology as well as a remarkable extension of the dKO mice lifespan. These findings suggest great potential for AAV-U7 in systemic treatment of the DMD phenotype.",,,,2012-03-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
22359642,The effects of low levels of dystrophin on mouse muscle function and pathology.,,PloS one,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe progressive muscular disorder caused by reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, preventing the synthesis of functional dystrophin. As dystrophin provides muscle fiber stability during contractions, dystrophin negative fibers are prone to exercise-induced damage. Upon exhaustion of the regenerative capacity, fibers will be replaced by fibrotic and fat tissue resulting in a progressive loss of function eventually leading to death in the early thirties. With several promising approaches for the treatment of DMD aiming at dystrophin restoration in clinical trials, there is an increasing need to determine more precisely which dystrophin levels are sufficient to restore muscle fiber integrity, protect against muscle damage and improve muscle function.To address this we generated a new mouse model (mdx-Xist(Δhs)) with varying, low dystrophin levels (3-47%, mean 22.7%, stdev 12.1, n = 24) due to skewed X-inactivation. Longitudinal sections revealed that within individual fibers, some nuclei did and some did not express dystrophin, resulting in a random, mosaic pattern of dystrophin expression within fibers.Mdx-Xist(Δhs), mdx and wild type females underwent a 12 week functional test regime consisting of different tests to assess muscle function at base line, or after chronic treadmill running exercise. Overall, mdx-Xist(Δhs) mice with 3-14% dystrophin outperformed mdx mice in the functional tests. Improved histopathology was observed in mice with 15-29% dystrophin and these levels also resulted in normalized expression of pro-inflammatory biomarker genes, while for other parameters >30% of dystrophin was needed. Chronic exercise clearly worsened pathology, which needed dystrophin levels >20% for protection. Based on these findings, we conclude that while even dystrophin levels below 15% can improve pathology and performance, levels of >20% are needed to fully protect muscle fibers from exercise-induced damage.",,,,2012-02-24,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
22319206,mRNA transcript diversity creates new opportunities for pharmacological intervention.,,Molecular pharmacology,"Most protein coding genes generate multiple RNA transcripts through alternative splicing, variable 3' and 5'UTRs, and RNA editing. Although drug design typically targets the main transcript, alternative transcripts can have profound physiological effects, encoding proteins with distinct functions or regulatory properties. Formation of these alternative transcripts is tissue-selective and context-dependent, creating opportunities for more effective and targeted therapies with reduced adverse effects. Moreover, genetic variation can tilt the balance of alternative versus constitutive transcripts or generate aberrant transcripts that contribute to disease risk. In addition, environmental factors and drugs modulate RNA splicing, affording new opportunities for the treatment of splicing disorders. For example, therapies targeting specific mRNA transcripts with splice-site-directed oligonucleotides that correct aberrant splicing are already in clinical trials for genetic disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. High-throughput sequencing technologies facilitate discovery of novel RNA transcripts and protein isoforms, applications ranging from neuromuscular disorders to cancer.

This measure has shown reliability, validity and utility as a primary outcome measure in DMD clinical trials. Because loss of muscle function in DMD occurs against the background of normal childhood growth and development, younger children with DMD can show increase in distance walked during 6MWT over ~1 year despite progressive muscular impairment. In this study, we compare 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) data from DMD boys (n=17) and typically developing control subjects (n=22) to existing normative data from age- and sex-matched children and adolescents. An age- and height-based equation fitted to normative data by Geiger and colleagues was used to convert 6MWD to a percent-predicted (%-predicted) value in boys with DMD. Analysis of %-predicted 6MWD data represents a method to account for normal growth and development, and shows that gains in function at early ages represents stable rather than improving abilities in boys with DMD. Boys with DMD from 4-7 years of age maintain a stable 6MWD approximately 80% of that of typically developing peers, with the deficit progressing at a variable rate thereafter.",,,,2012-02-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Drug discovery,"Here, we discuss three RNA-based therapeutic technologies exploiting various oligonucleotides that bind to RNA by base pairing in a sequence-specific manner yet have different mechanisms of action and effects. RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotides downregulate gene expression by inducing enzyme-dependent degradation of targeted mRNA. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides block the access of cellular machinery to pre-mRNA and mRNA without degrading the RNA. Through this mechanism, steric-blocking oligonucleotides can redirect alternative splicing, repair defective RNA, restore protein production or downregulate gene expression. Moreover, they can be extensively chemically modified to acquire more drug-like properties. The ability of RNA-blocking oligonucleotides to restore gene function makes them best suited for the treatment of genetic disorders.

22248393,Long-term preservation of cardiac structure and function after adeno-associated virus serotype 9-mediated microdystrophin gene transfer in mdx mice.,,Human gene therapy,"Dystrophin plays an important role in muscle contraction, linking the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Mutations of the dystrophin gene leading to a complete loss of the protein cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), frequently associated with severe cardiomyopathy. Early clinical trials in DMD using gene transfer to skeletal muscle are underway, but gene transfer to dystrophic cardiac muscle has not yet been tested in humans. The aim of this study was to develop an optimized protocol for cardiac gene therapy in the mouse model of dystrophin deficiency (mdx), using a cardiac promoter for expression of a microdystrophin (μDys) transgene packaged into an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector (AAV9). In this study adult mdx mice were intravenously injected with 1×10(12) genomic particles of AAV9 vectors carrying a cDNA encoding μDys under the control of either a ubiquitously active cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or a cardiac-specific CMV-enhanced myosin light chain (MLC0.26) promoter. After 10 months, both AAV9 vectors led to sustained μDys expression in cardiac muscle, but the MLC promoter conferred about 4-fold higher protein levels. AAV9-CMV-MLC0.26-μDys resulted in significant protection of cardiac morphology and function as assessed by histopathology, echocardiography, and left ventricular catheterization. In conclusion, we established an AAV9-mediated gene transfer approach for efficient and specific long-term μDys expression in the hearts of mdx mice, resulting in a sustained therapeutic effect. Thus, this approach might be a basis for further translation into a treatment strategy for DMD-associated cardiomyopathy.",,,,2012-01-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

However, their prescription remains controversial due to the significant side effects associated with the chronic treatment. It is a common belief that the clinical efficacy of GCs is due to their transrepression of pro-inflammatory genes through inhibition of inflammatory transcription factors (i.e. NF-κB, AP-1) whereas the adverse side effects are attributed to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated transcription of target genes (transactivation). The past decade has seen an increased interest in the development of GR modulators that maintain the effective anti-inflammatory properties but lack the GR-dependent transcriptional response as a safe alternative to traditional GCs. Many of these analogues or ""dissociative"" compounds show potential promise in in vitro studies but fail to reach human clinical trials.

Preclinical studies of adeno-associated virus gene therapy for DMD have been described in mouse and dog models of this disease. However, low and transient expression of microdystrophin in dystrophic dogs and a lack of long-term microdystrophin expression associated with a CD8(+)  T-cell response in DMD patients suggests that the development of improved microdystrophin genes and delivery strategies is essential for successful clinical trials in DMD patients.
We have previously shown the efficiency of mRNA sequence optimization of mouse microdystrophin in ameliorating the pathology of dystrophic mdx mice. In the present study, we generated adeno-associated virus (AAV)2/8 vectors expressing an mRNA sequence-optimized canine microdystrophin under the control of a muscle-specific promoter and injected intramuscularly into a single canine X-linked muscular dystrophy (CXMDj) dog.
Expression of stable and high levels of microdystrophin was observed along with an association of the dystrophin-associated protein complex in intramuscularly injected muscles of a CXMDj dog for at least 8 weeks without immune responses. Treated muscles were highly protected from dystrophic damage, with reduced levels of myofiber permeability and central nucleation.
The data obtained in the present study suggest that the use of canine-specific and mRNA sequence-optimized microdystrophin genes in conjunction with a muscle-specific promoter results in high and stable levels of microdystrophin expression in a canine model of DMD.

22102647,Dystrophin quantification and clinical correlations in Becker muscular dystrophy: implications for clinical trials.,,Brain : a journal of neurology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that disrupt the open reading frame and prevent the full translation of its protein product, dystrophin. Restoration of the open reading frame and dystrophin production can be achieved by exon skipping using antisense oligonucleotides targeted to splicing elements. This approach aims to transform the Duchenne muscular dystrophy phenotype to that of the milder disorder, Becker muscular dystrophy, typically caused by in-frame dystrophin deletions that allow the production of an internally deleted but partially functional dystrophin. There is ongoing debate regarding the functional properties of the different internally deleted dystrophins produced by exon skipping for different mutations; more insight would be valuable to improve and better predict the outcome of exon skipping clinical trials. To this end, we have characterized the clinical phenotype of 17 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy harbouring in-frame deletions relevant to on-going or planned exon skipping clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and correlated it to the levels of dystrophin, and dystrophin-associated protein expression. The cohort of 17 patients, selected exclusively on the basis of their genotype, included 4 asymptomatic, 12 mild and 1 severe patient. All patients had dystrophin levels of >40% of control and significantly higher dystrophin (P = 0.013), β-dystroglycan (P = 0.025) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (P = 0.034) expression was observed in asymptomatic individuals versus symptomatic patients with Becker muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, grouping the patients by deletion, patients with Becker muscular dystrophy with deletions with an end-point of exon 51 (the skipping of which could rescue the largest group of Duchenne muscular dystrophy deletions) showed significantly higher dystrophin levels (P = 0.034) than those with deletions ending with exon 53. This is the first quantitative study on both dystrophin and dystrophin-associated protein expression in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy with deletions relevant for on-going exon skipping trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) aim to restore the reading frame by skipping of a specific exon(s), thereby allowing the production of a shorter, but semifunctional protein, as is found in the mostly more mildly affected patients with Becker muscular dystrophy. AONs are currently being investigated in phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials. Most of the participating patients are treated symptomatically with corticosteroids (mainly predniso[lo]ne) to stabilize the muscle fibers, which might affect the uptake and/or efficiency of AONs. Therefore the effect of prednisolone on 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate AON efficacy in patient-derived cultured muscle cells and the mdx mouse model (after local and systemic AON treatment) was assessed in this study. Both in vitro and in vivo skip efficiency and biomarker expression were comparable between saline- and prednisolone-cotreated cells and mice. After systemic exon 23-specific AON (23AON) treatment for 8 weeks, dystrophin was detectable in all treated mice. Western blot analyses indicated slightly higher dystrophin levels in prednisolone-treated mice, which might be explained by better muscle condition and consequently more target dystrophin pre-mRNA. In addition, fibrotic and regeneration biomarkers were normalized to some extent in prednisolone- and/or 23AON-treated mice.

The French dystrophinopathy database provided clinical, histochemical and molecular data of 278 DMD patients (mean longitudinal follow-up: 14.2 years). Diagnosis was based on mutation identification in the DMD gene. Three groups were defined according to the age at ambulation loss: before 8 years (group A); between 8 and 11 years (group B); between 11 and 16 years (group C).
Motor and respiratory declines were statistically different between the three groups, as opposed to heart involvement. When acquired, running ability was lost at the mean age of 5.41 (group A), 7.11 (group B), 9.19 (group C) years; climbing stairs ability at 6.24 (group A), 7.99 (group B), 10,42 (group C) years, and ambulation at 7.10 (group A), 9.25 (group B), 12.01 (group C) years.

21912442,"Molecular diagnosis of duchenne muscular dystrophy: past, present and future in relation to implementing therapies.",,The Clinical biochemist. Reviews,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the commonest and best-known of the muscular dystrophies. Being an X-linked disorder, it affects mainly boys. The disease gene was identified in 1987, with the majority of mutations demonstrated to be large-scale deletions. Current best practice molecular diagnosis includes multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) followed by direct sequencing of all exons at the genomic level, or from cDNA, in order to detect point and other small mutations. The difference between DMD and the allelic Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is whether the precise mutation in the gene is a null mutation or results in a modified still partially functional protein. Over the last few years, significant progress has been made in moving experimental therapies into clinical trials, with one of the most promising possible therapies being anti-sense oligonucleotide induced exon-skipping, which converts DMD to BMD. In order to maximise the benefit from future therapies, it will be necessary to start administering the therapies as early as possible in the life of the affected boys, before significant muscle loss occurs. This will require early diagnosis, which evidence suggests is best achieved through population screening. Population screening also allows the avoidance of multiple affected boys in families with no previous family history.",,,,2011-09-14,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
21892079,Impending therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Current opinion in neurology,"As the first genetic disease for which the culpable gene was identified by positional cloning, Duchenne muscular dystrophy has served as a paradigm for therapeutic approaches to neuromuscular disease, in which role it has proved especially testing. The large mass and broad distribution of the target tissue, skeletal muscle, have stretched the patience and ingenuity of those seeking therapeutic delivery of the largest known gene. The most promising recent advances are summarized in this article.
The main obstacle to genetic therapies has been the development of vectors able to efficiently deliver large, potentially therapeutic, genetic constructs to the large and widely dispersed mass of body musculature. Recombinant viral vectors that efficiently transduce muscle are unable to carry the full-length construct. Myogenic cells that are able both to carry full-length genes and to repair muscles are technically challenging to produce in sufficient quantity. A recent promising approach is the use of agents that obviate the mutation.
Although genetic and cell-mediated approaches are currently showing genuine promise in preclinical and clinical trials, there remains considerable interest in the development of agents that ameliorate the downstream pathology. One general challenge is the three-way tension between the interests of patients, regulators, and the biotechnology industry.",,,,2011-09-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We discuss here the potential of antisense-mediated RNA targeting approaches. We mainly focus on those that manipulate splicing (exon skipping and exon inclusion), but will also briefly discuss mRNA targeting. Classic knockdown of expression by mRNA targeting is only one possible application of antisense oligonucleotides (AON) in the control of gene function. Exon skipping and inclusion are based on the interference of AONs with splicing of pre-mRNAs. These are powerful, specific and particularly versatile techniques, which can be used to circumvent pathogenic mutations, shift splice variant expression, knock down proteins, or to create molecular models using in-frame deletions. Pre-mRNA targeting is currently used both as a research tool, e.g., in models for motor neuron disease, and in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. AONs are particularly promising in relation to brain research, as the modified AONs are taken up extremely fast in neurons and glial cells with a long residence, and without the need for viral vectors or other delivery tools, once inside the blood brain barrier. In this review we cover (1). The principles of antisense-mediated techniques, chemistry, and efficacy. (2) The pros and cons of AON approaches in the brain compared to other techniques of interfering with gene function, such as transgenesis and short hairpin RNAs, in terms of specificity of the manipulation, spatial, and temporal control over gene expression, toxicity, and delivery issues.

The cause is the absence of dystrophin, a large structural protein indispensable for muscle cell function and viability. The mdx mouse has become the standard animal model for pre-clinical evaluation of potential therapeutic treatments. Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of experimental compounds being evaluated in the mdx mouse. There is, however, much variability in the design of these pre-clinical experimental studies. This has made it difficult to interpret and compare published data from different laboratories and to evaluate the potential of a treatment for application to patients. The authors therefore propose the introduction of a standard study design for the mdx mouse model. Several aspects, including animal care, sampling times and choice of tissues, as well as recommended endpoints and methodologies are addressed and, for each aspect, a standard procedure is proposed.

These hopes were fueled by early reports of delivering new functional genes to dystrophic muscle in mouse models using gene therapy and stem cell transplantation. However, significant barriers have thwarted translation of these approaches to true therapies, including insufficient therapeutic material (eg, cells and viral vectors), challenges in systemic delivery, and immunological hurdles. An alternative approach is to repair the patient's own gene. Two innovative small-molecule approaches have emerged as front-line molecular therapeutics: exon skipping and stop codon read through. Both approaches are in human clinical trials and aim to coax dystrophin protein production from otherwise inactive mutant genes. In the clinically severe dog model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the exon-skipping approach recently improved multiple functional outcomes.

Over the last 2 decades, major advances in dystrophin biology and gene delivery technology have created an opportunity to treat DMD with gene therapy. Remarkable success has been achieved in treating dystrophic mice. Several gene therapy strategies, including plasmid transfer, exon skipping, and adeno-associated virus-mediated microdystrophin therapy, have entered clinical trials. However, therapeutic benefit has not been realized in DMD patients. Bridging the gap between mice and humans is no doubt the most pressing issue facing DMD gene therapy now. In contrast to mice, dystrophin-deficient dogs are genetically and phenotypically similar to human patients. Preliminary gene therapy studies in the canine model may offer critical insights that cannot be obtained from murine studies. It is clear that the canine DMD model may represent an important link between mice and humans. Unfortunately, our current knowledge of dystrophic dogs is limited, and the full picture of disease progression remains to be clearly defined. We also lack rigorous outcome measures (such as in situ force measurement) to monitor therapeutic efficacy in dystrophic dogs. Undoubtedly, maintaining a dystrophic dog colony is technically demanding, and the cost of dog studies cannot be underestimated.

21637003,Modulation of RNA splicing as a potential treatment for cancer.,,Bioengineered bugs,"Close to 90% of human genes are transcribed into pre-mRNA that undergoes alternative splicing, producing multiple mRNAs and proteins from single genes. This process is largely responsible for human proteome diversity, and about half of genetic disease-causing mutations affect splicing. Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) comprise an emerging class of antisense therapeutics that modify gene expression by directing pre-mRNA splice site usage. Bauman et al. investigated an SSO that up-regulated the expression of an anti-cancer splice variant while simultaneously eliminating an over-expressed cancer-causing splice variant.  This was accomplished by targeting pre-mRNA of the apoptotic regulator Bcl-x, which is alternatively spliced to express anti- and pro-apoptotic splice variants Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS, respectively. High expression of Bcl-xL is a hallmark of many cancers and is considered a general mechanism used by cancer cells to evade apoptosis. Redirection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing from Bcl-xL to -xS by SSO induced apoptotic and chemosensitizing effects in various cancer cell lines. Importantly, the paper shows that delivery of Bcl-x SSO using a lipid nanoparticle redirected Bcl-x splicing and reduced tumor burden in melanoma lung metastases. This was the first demonstration of SSO efficacy in tumors in vivo. SSOs are not limited to be solely potential anti-cancer drugs. SSOs were first applied to repair aberrant splicing in thalassemia, a genetic disease, they have been used to create novel proteins (e.g., ∆7TNFR1), and they have recently progressed to clinical trials for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. ",,,,2011-06-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

There is significant evidence demonstrating that increasing levels of the dystrophin-related protein, utrophin, in mouse models results in sarcolemmal bound utrophin and prevents the muscular dystrophy pathology. The aim of this work was to develop a small molecule which increases the levels of utrophin in muscle and thus has therapeutic potential.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) results from mutations that disrupt the DMD gene open reading frame causing an absence of dystrophin protein. Antisense oligonucleotide (AO)-mediated exon skipping has been shown to restore functional dystrophin in mdx mice and DMD patients treated intramuscularly in two recent phase 1 clinical trials. Critical to the therapeutic success of AO-based treatment will be the ability to deliver AOs systemically to all affected tissues including the heart. Here, we report identification of a series of transduction peptides (Pip5) as AO conjugates for enhanced systemic and particularly cardiac delivery. One of the lead peptide-AO conjugates, Pip5e-AO, showed highly efficient exon skipping and dystrophin production in mdx mice with complete correction of the aberrant DMD transcript in heart, leading to >50% of the normal level of dystrophin in heart. Mechanistic studies indicated that the enhanced activity of Pip5e-phosphorodiamidate morpholino (PMO) is partly explained by more efficient nuclear delivery.

This X-linked pathology is due to the absence of dystrophin in muscle fibers. This lack of dystrophin leads to the progressive muscle degeneration that is often responsible for the death of the DMD patients during the third decade of their life. There are currently no curative treatments for this disease but different therapeutic approaches are being studied. Gene therapy consists of introducing a transgene coding for full-length or a truncated version of dystrophin complementary DNA (cDNA) in muscles, whereas pharmaceutical therapy includes the use of chemical/biochemical substances to restore dystrophin expression or alleviate the DMD phenotype. Over the past years, many potential drugs were explored. This led to several clinical trials for gentamicin and ataluren (PTC124) allowing stop codon read-through. An alternative approach is to induce the expression of an internally deleted, partially functional dystrophin protein through exon skipping.

21453280,RNA splicing manipulation: strategies to modify gene expression for a variety of therapeutic outcomes.,,Current gene therapy,"Antisense oligomers initially showed promise as compounds to modify gene expression, primarily through RNaseH induced degradation of the target transcript. Expansion of the field has led to new chemistries capable of invoking different mechanisms, including suppression of protein synthesis by translational blockade and gene silencing using short interfering RNAs. It is now apparent that the majority of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed and non-protein coding RNAs have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression at many levels. This review considers potential therapeutic applications of antisense oligomers to modify gene expression, primarily by interfering with the process of exon recognition and intron removal during gene transcript splicing. While suppression of gene expression will be necessary to address some conditions, it is likely that antisense oligomer splice modification will have extensive clinical application. Pre-mRNA splicing is a tightly co-ordinated, multifactorial process that can be disrupted by antisense oligomers in a highly specific manner to suppress aberrant splicing, remove exons to by-pass nonsense or frame-shifting mutations or influence exon selection to alter spliceoform ratios. Manipulation of splicing patterns has been applied to a diverse range of conditions, including b-thalassemia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and certain cancers. Alternative exon usage has been identified as a major mechanism for generating diversity from a limited repertoire of genes in higher eukaryotes. Considering that the majority of all human primary gene transcripts are reportedly alternatively spliced, intervention at the level of pre-mRNA processing is likely to become increasingly significant in the fight against genetic and acquired disorders.",,,,2011-04-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
21446846,Antisense drug discovery and development.,,Future medicinal chemistry,"Numerous chemically modified oligonucleotides have been developed so far and show their own unique chemical properties and pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic characteristics. Among all non-natural nucleotides, to the best of our knowledge, only five chemistries are currently being tested in clinical trials: phosphorothioate, 2´-O-methyl RNA, 2´-O-methoxyethyl RNA, 2´,4´-bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid and the phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer. Since phosphorothioate modification can improve the pharmacokinetics of oligonucleotides, this modification is currently used in combination with all other modifications except phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer. For the treatment of metabolic, cardiovascular, cancer and other systemic diseases, the phosphorothioate class of drugs is obviously helpful, while superior efficacies can be observed in phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer compared to other classes of oligonucleotides for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy, and although the molecular mechanisms of the disease have been extensively investigated since the discovery of the gene in 1986, there is currently no effective treatment. However, new gene-based therapies have recently emerged with particular noted advances in using conventional gene replacement strategies, RNA-based technology and pharmacological approaches. While the proof of principle has been demonstrated in animal models, several clinical trials have recently been undertaken to investigate the feasibility of these strategies in patients. In particular, antisense-mediated exon skipping has shown encouraging results and holds promise for the treatment of dystrophic muscle.

21428760,Systemic administration of PRO051 in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.,,The New England journal of medicine,"Local intramuscular administration of the antisense oligonucleotide PRO051 in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy with relevant mutations was previously reported to induce the skipping of exon 51 during pre-messenger RNA splicing of the dystrophin gene and to facilitate new dystrophin expression in muscle-fiber membranes. The present phase 1-2a study aimed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and molecular and clinical effects of systemically administered PRO051.
We administered weekly abdominal subcutaneous injections of PRO051 for 5 weeks in 12 patients, with each of four possible doses (0.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mg per kilogram of body weight) given to 3 patients. Changes in RNA splicing and protein levels in the tibialis anterior muscle were assessed at two time points. All patients subsequently entered a 12-week open-label extension phase, during which they all received PRO051 at a dose of 6.0 mg per kilogram per week. Safety, pharmacokinetics, serum creatine kinase levels, and muscle strength and function were assessed.
The most common adverse events were irritation at the administration site and, during the extension phase, mild and variable proteinuria and increased urinary α(1)-microglobulin levels; there were no serious adverse events. The mean terminal half-life of PRO051 in the circulation was 29 days. PRO051 induced detectable, specific exon-51 skipping at doses of 2.0 mg or more per kilogram. New dystrophin expression was observed between approximately 60% and 100% of muscle fibers in 10 of the 12 patients, as measured on post-treatment biopsy, which increased in a dose-dependent manner to up to 15.6% of the expression in healthy muscle. After the 12-week extension phase, there was a mean (±SD) improvement of 35.2±28.7 m (from the baseline of 384±121 m) on the 6-minute walk test.

We describe that, as consequence of fibre damage, specific muscle-miRNAs are released in to the bloodstream of DMD patients and their levels correlate with the severity of the disease. The same miRNAs are abundant also in the blood of mdx mice and recover to wild-type levels in animals 'cured' through exon skipping. Even though creatine kinase (CK) blood levels have been utilized as diagnostic markers of several neuromuscular diseases, including DMD, we demonstrate that they correlate less well with the disease severity. Although the analysis of a larger number of patients should allow to obtain more refined correlations with the different stages of disease progression, we propose that miR-1, miR-133, and miR-206 are new and valuable biomarkers for the diagnosis of DMD and possibly also for monitoring the outcomes of therapeutic interventions in humans.

21410696,Moving towards meaningful measurement: Rasch analysis of the North Star Ambulatory Assessment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Developmental medicine and child neurology,"Reliable measurement of disease progression and the effect of therapeutic interventions in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) require clinically meaningful and scientifically sound rating scales. Therefore, we need robust evidence to support such tools. The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) is a promising, clinician-rated scale with potential uses spanning clinical practice and clinical trials. In this study, we used Rasch analysis to test its suitability in these roles as a measurement instrument.
NSAA data from 191 ambulant boys (mean age at assessment 7 y 8 mo, SD 2 y 4 mo; range 3 y 6 mo-15 y 5 mo) with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD were examined for psychometric properties including clinical meaning, targeting, response categories, model fit, reliability, dependency, stability, and raw to interval-level measurement. All analyses were performed using the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model.
Overall, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as being a reliable (high Person Separation Index of 0.91) and valid (good targeting, little misfit, no reversed thresholds) measure of ambulatory function in DMD. One item displayed misfit (lifts head, fit residual 6.9) and there was evidence for some local dependency (stand on right/left leg, climb and descend box step right/left leg, and hop on right/left leg, residual correlations >0.40), which we provide potential solutions for in future use of the NSAA. Importantly, our findings supported good clinical validity in that the hierarchy of items within the scale produced by the analyses was supported by clinical opinion, thus increasing the clinical interpretability of scale scores.

21399986,Genotype and phenotype characterization in a large dystrophinopathic cohort with extended follow-up.,,Journal of neurology,"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD, respectively) are allelic disorders with different clinical presentations and severity determined by mutations in the gene DMD, which encodes the sarcolemmal protein dystrophin. Diagnosis is based on clinical aspects and muscle protein analysis, followed by molecular confirmation. We revised the main aspects of the natural history of dystrophinopathies to define genotype-phenotype correlations in large patient cohorts with extended follow-up. We also specifically explored subjects carrying nucleotide substitutions in the DMD gene, a comparatively less investigated DMD/BMD subgroup. We studied 320 dystrophinopathic patients (205 DMD and 115 BMD), defining muscular, cardiac, respiratory, and cognitive involvement. We also subdivided patients according to the kind of molecular defect (deletions, duplications, nucleotide substitutions or other microrearrangements) and the mutation sites (proximal/distal to exon 45), studying phenotype-genotype correlations for each group. In DMD, mutation type did not influence clinical evolution; mutations located in distal regions (irrespective of their nature) are more likely to be associated with lower IQ levels (p = 0.005). BMD carrying proximal deletions showed a higher degree of cardiac impairment than BMD with distal deletions (p = 0.0046). In the BMD population, there was a strong correlation between the entity of muscle dystrophin deficiency and clinical course (p = 0.002). An accurate knowledge of natural history may help in the clinical management of patients. Furthermore, several clinical trials are ongoing or are currently planned, some of which aim to target specific DMD mutations: a robust natural history is therefore essential to correctly design these experimental trials.",,,,2011-03-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
21342350,Exon-skipping events in candidates for clinical trials of morpholino.,,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are caused by abnormalities in the DMD gene. The majority of DMD patients have out-of-frame deletion(s), which disrupt the reading frame; while some cases of DMD are caused by duplication or nonsense mutation(s). Most patients with BMD have in-frame deletion(s), which preserve the reading frame. The phenotype of BMD is generally milder than that of DMD. Antisense morpholino-mediated exon skipping, which changes out-of-frame deletions to in-frame deletions, is a promising therapeutic approach for DMD. It is necessary, however, to confirm the exon-skipping event in cells of DMD patients before the clinical trial.
Fibroblasts isolated from four DMD patients were induced to differentiate into the myogenic lineage by infection with Ad.CAGMyoD. The cells were then transfected with two types of morpholino. The exon-skipping event was analyzed on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Morpholino B30, which is located at the splicing enhancer of exon 51 of the DMD gene, yielded the desired exon 51-skipping event in all deletion patterns of cells tested. Morpholino I25, which is located at the exon donor, induced two different exon-skipping patterns, which are total or partial exon 51-skipping events. According to the sequence analysis, the unexpected unskipped regions were the 95 bp section and the 188 bp section of exon 51, showing that the cryptic splicing donor was newly produced with I25. Unfortunately, these cryptic splicing donors gave rise to out-of-frame patterns. Based on these in vitro results, B30 would presumably be an effective therapy. Interestingly, the cocktail of B30 and I25 appeared to yield a more efficient exon 51-skipping event.

21263136,Muscle histology vs MRI in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Neurology,"There are currently no effective treatments to halt the muscle breakdown in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), although genetic-based clinical trials are being piloted. Most of these trials have as an endpoint the restoration of dystrophin in muscle fibers, hence requiring sufficiently well-preserved muscle of recruited patients. The choice of the muscles to be studied and the role of noninvasive methods to assess muscle preservation therefore require further evaluation.
We studied the degree of muscle involvement in the lower leg muscles of 34 patients with DMD >8 years, using muscle MRI. In a subgroup of 15 patients we correlated the muscle MRI findings with the histology of open extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle biopsies. Muscle MRI involvement was assigned using a scale 0-4 (normal-severe).
In all patients we documented a gradient of involvement of the lower leg muscles: the posterior compartment (gastrocnemius > soleus) was most severely affected; the anterior compartment (tibialis anterior/posterior, popliteus, extensor digitorum longus) least affected. Muscle MRI showed EDB involvement that correlated with the patient's age (p = 0.055). We show a correlation between the MRI and EDB histopathologic changes, with MRI 3-4 grades associated with a more severe fibro-adipose tissue replacement. The EDB was sufficiently preserved for bulk and signal intensity in 18/22 wheelchair users aged 10-16.6 years.

By utilizing antisense oligonucleotides, splicing of the dystrophin transcript can be altered so that exons harbouring a mutation are excluded from the mature mRNA. Although this approach has been shown to be effective to restore partially functional dystrophin protein, the level of dystrophin protein that is necessary to rescue a severe muscle pathology has not been addressed. As zebrafish dystrophin mutants (dmd) resemble the severe muscle pathology of human patients, we have utilized this model to evaluate exon skipping. Novel dmd mutations were identified to enable the design of phenotype rescue studies via morpholino administration. Correlation of induced exon-skipping efficiency and the level of phenotype rescue suggest that relatively robust levels of exon skipping are required to achieve significant therapeutic ameliorations and that pre-screening analysis of exon-skipping drugs in zebrafish may help to more accurately predict clinical trials for therapies of DMD.",,,,2011-01-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Selective removal of exons flanking an out-of-frame DMD mutation can result in an in-frame mRNA transcript that may be translated into an internally deleted, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)-like, but functionally active dystrophin protein with therapeutic activity. Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) can be designed to bind to complementary sequences in the targeted mRNA and modify pre-mRNA splicing to correct the reading frame of a mutated transcript so that gene expression is restored. AO-induced exon skipping producing functional truncated dystrophin exon has been demonstrated in animal models of DMD both in vitro and in vivo, and in DMD patient cells in vitro in culture, and in DMD muscle explants. More recently, AO-mediated exon skipping has been confirmed in DMD patients in Phase I clinical trials. However, it should be noted that personalized molecular medicine may be necessary, since the various reading frame-disrupting mutations are spread across the DMD gene. The different deletions that cause DMD would require skipping of different exons, which would require the optimization and clinical trial workup of many specific AOs. This chapter describes the methodologies available for the optimization of AOs, and in particular phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), for the targeted skipping of specific exons on the DMD gene.",,,,2011-01-05,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Owing to the large size of the gene, the mutation rate in both germline and somatic cells is very high. Nearly 13-15% of DMD cases are caused by nonsense mutations leading to premature termination codons in the reading frame that results in truncated dystrophin protein. Currently there is no cure for DMD. The only available treatment is the use of glucocorticoids that have modest beneficial effects accompanied by significant side effects. Different therapeutic strategies have been developed ranging from gene therapy to exon skipping and nonsense mutation suppression to produce the full-length protein. These strategies have shown promise in the mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy where they have been reported to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype and correct the physiological defects in the membrane.

Systemic production of truncated but functional dystrophin proteins has been achieved in animal models. Furthermore, phase I/II clinical trials in United Kingdom and the Netherlands have demonstrated dystrophin induction by local and systemic administrations of antisense oligomers. However, long-term efficacy and potential toxicity remain to be determined. The present study examined 1-year systemic effect of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) treatment targeting mutated dystrophin exon 23 in mdx mice. PMO induced dystrophin expression dose-dependently and significantly improved skeletal muscle pathology and function with reduced creatine kinase (CK) levels by a regimen of 60 mg/kg biweekly administration. This regimen induced <2% dystrophin expression in the heart, but improved cardiac functions demonstrated by hemodynamics analysis. The results suggest that low levels of dystrophin induction may be able to provide detectable benefit to cardiac muscle with limited myopathy. Body weight, serum enzyme tests, and histology analysis showed no sign of toxicity in the mice treated with up to 1.5 g/kg PMO for 6 months.

Although there is no current effective treatment for these devastating diseases, various molecular strategies have been developed to restore the expressions of the associated defective proteins. In preclinical animal models, both viral and nonviral vectors have been shown to deliver recombinant versions of defective genes. Antisense oligonucleotides have been shown to modify the splicing mechanism of mesenger ribonucleic acid to produce an internally deleted but partially functional dystrophin in an experimental model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In addition, chemicals can induce readthrough of the premature stop codon in nonsense mutations of the dystrophin gene. On the basis of these preclinical data, several experimental clinical trials are underway that aim to demonstrate efficacy in treating these devastating diseases.",,,,2010-10-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Dystrophin-specific T cells were detected after treatment, providing evidence of transgene expression even when the functional protein was not visualized in skeletal muscle. Circulating dystrophin-specific T cells were unexpectedly detected in two patients before vector treatment. Revertant dystrophin fibers, which expressed functional, truncated dystrophin from the deleted endogenous gene after spontaneous in-frame splicing, contained epitopes targeted by the autoreactive T cells. The potential for T-cell immunity to self and nonself dystrophin epitopes should be considered in designing and monitoring experimental therapies for this disease.

Successful proof-of-principle in preclinical models has led to human clinical trials. However, it is still not known what percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers and what level of expression is necessary for functional improvement. This study directly address these key questions in the mdx mouse model of DMD. To achieve a significant variation in dystrophin expression, we locally administered into tibialis anterior muscles various doses of a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) designed to skip the mutated exon 23 from the mRNA of murine dystrophin. We found a highly significant correlation between the number of dystrophin-positive fibers and resistance to contraction-induced injury, with a minimum of 20% of dystrophin-positive fibers required for meaningful improvement. Furthermore, our results also indicate that a relatively low level of dystrophin expression in muscle fibers may have significant clinical benefits. In contrast, improvements in muscle force were not correlated with either the number of positive fibers or total dystrophin levels, which highlight the need to conduct appropriate functional assessments in preclinical testing using the mdx mouse.",,,,2010-10-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
20886387,Adeno-associated virus for the treatment of muscle diseases: toward clinical trials.,,Current opinion in molecular therapeutics,"Muscle diseases include muscular dystrophies, cardiomyopathies, neuromuscular and metabolic disorders. The loss of normal muscle structure and function is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy usually lose ambulation in their teenage years, and frequently experience severe respiratory problems and heart failure in later stages of life. These unmet medical needs have encouraged the development of genetic strategies targeting the underlying muscle disease processes. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been identified as promising gene delivery candidates because of their ability to transduce muscle tissue efficiently while transporting a genetic payload. There is currently significant momentum in the research of AAV-mediated delivery of muscle genes. Various AAV-based therapeutic strategies are undergoing preclinical and clinical testing, including the use of miniaturized and codon-optimized transgenes, exon skipping expression cassettes, novel tissue-specific promoters, AAV capsid mutants and chimeras, and localized intravascular administration procedures. These advancements in gene delivery have led to the generation of AAV vectors with targeted transgene expression, tissue-selective tropism and minimal off-target effects. This review describes advances in AAV gene therapy that are specific to the treatment of muscle diseases, and discusses the implications of their clinical application.",,,,2010-10-05,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In-frame deletions of the hinge 3 region of the dystrophin protein, which is encoded by exons 50 and 51, are predicted to cause a variety of phenotypes. Here, we performed functional analyses of muscle in the exon 52-deleted mdx (mdx52) mouse, to predict the function of in-frame dystrophin following exon 51-skipping, which leads to a protein lacking most of hinge 3. A series of AOs based on phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers was screened by intramuscular injection into mdx52 mice. The highest splicing efficiency was generated by a two-oligonucleotide cocktail targeting both the 5' and 3' splice sites of exon 51. After a dose-escalation study, we systemically delivered this cocktail into mdx52 mice seven times at weekly intervals. This induced 20-30% of wild-type (WT) dystrophin expression levels in all muscles, and was accompanied by amelioration of the dystrophic pathology and improvement of skeletal muscle function. Because the structure of the restored in-frame dystrophin resembles human dystrophin following exon 51-skipping, our results are encouraging for the ongoing clinical trials for DMD. Moreover, the therapeutic dose required can provide a suggestion of the theoretical equivalent dose for humans.",,,,2010-09-09,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In this investigation, it was hypothesised that steroid therapy is associated with morphological changes in the dystrophic muscle.
To test this hypothesis, two muscle biopsies were obtained (one biopsy before treatment, and the second 6 months following prednisone therapy) from 24 patients with dystrophies (18 DMD, 6 BMD). The participants were categorised into: control (6 specimens, normal muscle), untreated and treated groups. The muscle was evaluated for ultrastructural changes using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
In the untreated group, the muscle fibres were degenerated and of variable sizes. The myofibrils were thin with either complete loss of bands and/or abnormal banding patterns. The Z-lines were irregularly spaced and loosely registered. The mitochondria of the myofibrils were small, few, spherical and irregularly distributed. Numerous dendritic cells (DCs) with euchromatic nuclei, and multiple and long dendrites, were seen among the myofibrils. The collagen fibres among the muscle fibres (endomysium) were numerous and large. The satellite cells had euchromatic nuclei with clumps of heterochromatin.

20801085,"Treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with ciclosporin A: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial.",,The Lancet. Neurology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare X-linked progressive disease characterised by loss of ambulation at about age 10 years, with death in early adulthood due to respiratory and cardiac insufficiency. Steroids are effective at slowing the progression of muscle weakness; however, their use is limited by side-effects, prompting the search for alternatives. We assessed the effect of ciclosporin A as monotherapy and in combination with intermittent prednisone for the treatment of ambulant patients with this disorder.
Our study was a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre trial at trial sites of the German muscular dystrophy network, MD-NET, over 36 months. Ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were aged 5 years or older were randomly assigned to receive either ciclosporin A (3·5-4·0 mg/kg per day) or matching placebo. Allocation was done centrally with computer-generated random numbers. Patients and investigators were masked to the allocated treatment. After 3 months of treatment, both groups were also given intermittent prednisone for a further 12 months (0·75 mg/kg, alternating 10 days on with 10 days off). All patients who received at least one dose of study drug or placebo were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome measure was manual muscle strength measured on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. This trial is registered with the German clinical trial register DRKS, number DRKS00000445.
77 patients were randomly assigned to the ciclosporin A group and 76 to the placebo group; 73 patients on ciclosporin A and 73 on placebo received at least one dose and were available for efficacy analyses. 3 months of treatment with ciclosporin A alone did not show any significant improvement in primary outcome measures (mean change in the proportion of a possible total MRC score [%MRC] was -2·6 [SD 6·0] for patients on ciclosporin A and -0·8 [4·9] for patients on placebo; adjusted group difference estimate -0·88, 97·5% CI -2·6 to 0·9; p=0·26). The combination of ciclosporin A with intermittent steroids was not better than intermittent steroids alone over 12 months (mean change in %MRC was 0·7 [7·1] for patients on ciclosporin A and -0·3 [7·9] for patients on placebo; adjusted group difference estimate -0·85, -3·6 to 1·9; p=0·48). Numbers of adverse events (75 in patients on ciclosporin A and 74 on placebo) and serious adverse events (four with ciclosporin A and four with placebo) did not differ significantly between groups.
Ciclosporin A alone or in combination with intermittent prednisone does not improve muscle strength or functional abilities in ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but is safe and well tolerated.

20721765,Inferences for joint modelling of repeated ordinal scores and time to event data.,,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,"In clinical trials and other follow-up studies, it is natural that a response variable is repeatedly measured during follow-up and the occurrence of some key event is also monitored. There has been a considerable study on the joint modelling these measures together with information on covariates. But most of the studies are related to continuous outcomes. In many situations instead of observing continuous outcomes, repeated ordinal outcomes are recorded over time. The joint modelling of such serial outcomes and the time to event data then becomes a bit complicated. In this article we have attempted to analyse such models through a latent variable model. In view of the longitudinal variation on the ordinal outcome measure, it is desirable to account for the dependence between ordered categorical responses and survival time for different causes due to unobserved factors. A flexible Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) method based on exact likelihood is proposed that can simultaneously handle the longitudinal ordinal data and also the censored time to event data. A computationally more efficient MCEM method based on approximation of the likelihood is also proposed. The method is applied to a number of ordinal scores and survival data from trials of a treatment for children suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to examine the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators in the joint model under two different methods.",,,,2010-08-20,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We reliably quantified the time spend sitting, standing, lying, walking, the number of steps taken, the cadence, the number of walking episodes and their duration as well as how these were distributed over the day. Parameters possibly reflecting endurance, such as the duration of the walking episodes or the succession of two or three walking episodes lasting more than 30 s were the most improved after prednisolone treatment.

20691042,Physical training in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: the protocol of the No Use is Disuse study.,,BMC pediatrics,"""Use it or lose it"" is a well known saying which is applicable to boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Besides the direct effects of the muscular dystrophy, the increasing effort to perform activities, the fear of falling and the use of personal aids indirectly impair leg and arm functions as a result of disuse. Physical training could oppose this secondary physical deterioration. The No Use is Disuse (NUD) study is the first study in human subjects with DMD that will examine whether a low-intensity physical training is beneficial in terms of preservation of muscle endurance and functional abilities. The study consists of two training intervention studies: study 1 ""Dynamic leg and arm training for ambulant and recently wheelchair-dependent boys with DMD and, study 2 ""Functional training with arm support for boys with DMD who have been confined to a wheelchair for several years"". This paper describes the hypotheses and methods of the NUD study.
Study 1 is an explorative randomized controlled trial with multiple baseline measurements. Thirty boys with a DNA-established diagnosis of DMD will be included. The intervention consists of a six-months physical training during which boys train their legs and arms with active and/or assisted cycling training equipment. The primary study outcomes are muscle endurance and functional abilities, assessed with a Six-Minute Bicycle Test and the Motor Function Measure. Study 2 has a within-group repeated measurements design and will include ten boys with DMD who have already been confined to a wheelchair for several years. The six-months physical training program consists of 1) a computer-assisted training and 2) a functional training with an arm support. The primary study outcome is functional abilities of the upper extremity, assessed with the Action Research Arm Test.
The NUD study will fill part of the gap in the current knowledge about the possible effects of training in boys with DMD and will increase insight into what type of exercise should be recommended to boys with DMD. The study will finish at the end of 2010 and results are expected in 2011.

It is unclear whether asymptomatic mild cardiomyopathy should be treated with standard heart failure therapies.
We tested the effect of metoprolol on cardiac haemodynamics and pathology in two animal models for muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Treatment started at an early stage in the development of the cardiomyopathy. Metoprolol was given orally (2.5 mg/kg/day) over 8 weeks to mdx mice (model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and δ-sarcoglycan-deficient (Sgcd(null)) mice (model for Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F). In vivo pressure-volume loops, fibrosis, in vivo myocyte sarcolemmal injury, and β-adrenergic receptor mRNA were assessed. In β-blocked mdx mice, there was a beneficial reduction in afterload and restored contractility resulting in an increased stroke volume. In contrast, in Sgcd(null) mice, there was marked deterioration in haemodynamics (prolonged relaxation, Tau, and reduced stroke volume). Furthermore, challenging the β-blocked Sgcd(null) mice with the β-adrenergic agonist dobutamine led to markedly increased mortality. Patterns of sarcolemmal injury or β-adrenergic receptor mRNA could not account for this, though the acute rise in markers of active relaxation suggested abnormally high levels of intracellular calcium.

The mean maintenance dose of carvedilol in BB group was 7.85+/-2.80 mg/day. Clinical signs and cardiac function were monitored regularly and statistical analysis was done.
The survival rate free from primary endpoints (death, deterioration of heart failure and severe arrhythmia) was higher in the BB group. The survival rate free from all-cause death was also higher in the BB group, although not significantly higher. Patients with primary endpoints received lower maintenance doses of carvedilol and presented higher mean heart rates (HR) during the observation period. In the BB group, mean HR at enrollment and the reduction of mean HR were correlated with the change of ejection fraction.

A common characteristic is that the native splice sites remain intact thus retaining the potential for normal splicing. Antisense oligonucleotides (AO) have been shown to modulate the splicing pattern by steric hindrance of the recognition and binding of the splicing apparatus to the selected sequences. In the case of pseudoexons, AO force the use of the natural splice sites, recovering normally spliced transcripts encoding functional protein. This review summarizes the present knowledge of antisense splicing modulation as a molecular therapy approach for pseudoexon-activating mutations, with a focus in IMD. Although the feasibility of treatment for patients with IMD has yet to be proven, it appears to be clinically promising, as positive results have been reported in cellular and animal models of disease, and antisense therapy for splicing modulation is currently in the clinical trials phase for Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Here, we review the most recent advances in AO stability, targeting and delivery, and other issues to be considered for an effective treatment in the clinical setting.

This causes the ribosome to prematurely terminate its reading of the mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript and lack of production of a normal full-length protein. Such premature termination codon mutations occur in an estimated 10% to 15% of many genetically based disorders, including Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy. Therapeutic strategies have been developed to induce ribosomal read-through of nonsense mutations in mRNA and allow production of a full-length functional protein. Small-molecule drugs (aminoglycosides and ataluren [PTC124]) have been developed and are in clinical testing in patients with nonsense mutations within the dystrophin gene.

Mutation suppression of stop codons, successfully achieved in the mdx mouse using gentamicin, represents an important evolving treatment strategy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Two DMD cohorts received 14-day gentamicin (7.5mg/kg/day): Cohort 1 (n = 10) stop codon patients and Cohort 2 (n = 8) frameshift controls. Two additional stop codon DMD cohorts were gentamicin treated (7.5mg/kg) for 6 months: Cohort 3 (n = 12) dosed weekly and Cohort 4 (n = 4) dosed twice weekly. Pre- and post-treatment biopsies were assessed for dystrophin levels, as were clinical outcomes.
In the 14-day study, serum creatine kinase (CK) dropped by 50%, which was not seen in frameshift DMD controls. After 6 months of gentamicin, dystrophin levels significantly increased (p = 0.027); the highest levels reached 13 to 15% of normal (1 in Cohort 3, and 2 in Cohort 4), accompanied by reduced serum CK favoring drug-induced readthrough of stop codons. This was supported by stabilization of strength and a slight increase in forced vital capacity. Pretreatment stable transcripts predicted an increase of dystrophin after gentamicin. Readthrough efficiency was not affected by the stop codon or its surrounding fourth nucleotide. In 1 subject, antigen-specific interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay detected an immunogenic dystrophin epitope.
The results support efforts to achieve drug-induced mutation suppression of stop codons.

After 6 months of gentamicin, dystrophin levels significantly increased (p = 0.027); the highest levels reached 13 to 15% of normal (1 in Cohort 3, and 2 in Cohort 4), accompanied by reduced serum CK favoring drug-induced readthrough of stop codons. This was supported by stabilization of strength and a slight increase in forced vital capacity. Pretreatment stable transcripts predicted an increase of dystrophin after gentamicin. Readthrough efficiency was not affected by the stop codon or its surrounding fourth nucleotide.

In 1986, the first causative gene was identified for the most prevalent and best-characterized form of muscular dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Over the past 25 years, the number of other genes determined to cause different subtypes has grown rapidly. This review gives a synopsis of the 45 genetically defined types of muscular dystrophies and describes the clinical, pathologic, and molecular aspects of each disease. DNA diagnosis remains the most sensitive and specific method for differential diagnosis, but molecular diagnostics can be expensive and complex (because of multiple genes at multiple testing facilities) and reimbursement may be challenging to obtain. However, emerging DNA sequencing technologies (eg, single-molecule third-generation sequencing units) promise to dramatically reduce the complexity and costs of DNA diagnostics. Treatment for nearly all forms remains supportive and is aimed at preventing complications. However, several promising approaches have entered clinical trials, providing tangible hope that quality of life will improve for many patients in the near future.",,,,2010-05-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
20458276,Accurate quantification of dystrophin mRNA and exon skipping levels in duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,"Antisense oligonucleotide (AON)-mediated exon skipping aimed at restoring the reading frame is a promising therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that is currently tested in clinical trials. Numerous AONs have been tested in (patient-derived) cultured muscle cells and the mdx mouse model. The main outcome to measure AON efficiency is usually the exon-skipping percentage, though different groups use different methods to assess these percentages. Here, we compare a series of techniques to quantify exon skipping levels in AON-treated mdx mouse muscle. We compared densitometry of RT-PCR products on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, primary and nested RT-PCR followed by bioanalyzer analysis and melting curve analysis. The digital array system (Fluidigm) allows absolute quantification of skipped vs non-skipped transcripts and was used as a reference. Digital array results show that 1 ng of mdx gastrocnemius muscle-derived mRNA contains approximately 1100 dystrophin transcripts and that 665 transcripts are sufficient to determine exon-skipping levels. Quantification using bioanalyzer or densitometric analysis of primary PCR products resulted in values close to those obtained with digital array.

A secondary analysis was performed on 26 ambulatory DMD boys aged 3-11 y selected for a randomised trial of glutamine supplementation. We assessed fat free mass (FFM) and percentage fat mass (%FM) by BIA (monofrequency (50kHz) unit), ST measurements and a criterion method, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and repeated these measures 5 mo later at 3 outpatient clinical investigation centers in France.
When compared with DXA reference method, ST overestimated change in FFM (P<0.01), whereas BIA estimates did not differ from DXA. Concordance plots revealed that when compared with DXA, ST overestimated the increase in FFM (mean: 0.6 kg; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.99) which led to an underestimation in %FM change (mean: -1.4%; 95% CI: -2.6 to -0.2), whereas BIA estimated change in FFM (mean: -0.05 kg; 95% CI: -0.39 to 0.29) and %FM (mean: 1.3%; 95% CI: -0.06 to 2.7) more accurately.

As restoration of dystrophin expression is the end point of clinical trials, such residual dystrophin is a key factor in recruitment of patients and may also confound the analysis of dystrophin restoration in treated patients, if, as previously observed in the mdx mouse, revertant fibres increase with age. In 62% of the diagnostic biopsies reports of 65 DMD patients studied, traces or revertants were recorded with no correlation between traces or revertants, the patients' performance, or corticosteroids response. In nine of these patients, there was no increase in traces or revertants in biopsies taken a mean of 8.23 years (5.8-10.4 years) after the original diagnostic biopsy.

Eighteen patients received creatine monohydrate (Cr; 5 g/day for 8 weeks), while 15 received placebo (500 mg of vitamin C). Phosphorus metabolite ratios were determined from the right calf muscle of patients using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) both prior to (baseline) and after supplementation of Cr or placebo. In addition, metabolite ratios were determined in normal calf muscle of age and sex matched controls (n=8). Significant differences in several metabolite ratios were observed between controls and DMD patients indicating a lower energy state in these patients. Analysis using analysis of covariance adjusted for age and stature showed that the mean phosphocreatine (PCr)/inorganic phosphate (Pi) ratio in patients treated with Cr (4.7; 95% CI; 3.9-5.6) was significantly higher (P=.03) compared to the placebo group (3.3; 95% CI; 2.5-4.2). The mean percentage increase in PCr/Pi ratio was also more in patients <7 years of age compared to older patients after Cr supplementation indicating variation in therapeutic effect with the age. In the placebo group, significant reduction in PCr/Pi (P=.0009), PCr/t-ATP (P=.05) and an increase in phosphodiester (PDE)/PCr ratios was observed after supplementation. Further, in the placebo group, patients <7 years showed reduction of PCr/t-ATP and Pi/t-ATP compared to older patients (>7 years), after supplementation. These results imply that the significant difference observed in PCr/Pi ratio between the Cr and the placebo groups after supplementation may be attributed to a decrease of PCr in the placebo group and an increase in PCr in the Cr group. Changes in MMT score between the two groups was significant (P=.04); however, no change in functional scale (P=.19) was observed. Parents reported subjective improvement on Cr supplementation versus worsening in placebo (P=.02). Our results indicated that Cr was well tolerated and oral Cr significantly improved the muscle PCr/Pi ratio and preserved the muscle strength in short term.

However, since DMD patients are few in number and disease manifestations vary considerably in early and late stages of disease, obtaining the data needed for full evaluation of putative therapies may prove challenging. Should ambulation remain the focus of Phase 2/3 studies or should consideration be given to the primary causes of late-stage morbidity and mortality, e.g., cardiac and respiratory dysfunction related to reduced or absent dystrophin production?

The sample material obtained in muscle biopsies is limited and the measurement of multiple proteins is often restricted to conventional, non-quantitative assays, i.e. immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Here, we demonstrate that reverse protein arrays are a novel and excellent material-saving method for the measurement and quantification of changes in protein expression between healthy and diseased muscle tissue as well as cultured primary myotubes. We evaluated a set of antibodies and found reproducible differences between Duchenne muscular dystrophy/limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients and control samples for dystrophin, the sarcoglycans and the dystroglycans. As little as 10 mg of tissue is sufficient for the analysis of all diagnostically relevant proteins. The average coefficient of variation calculated for the sample signals confirmed that the method is highly reproducible. Thus, our experiments provide strong evidence that quantitative protein detection from very small amounts of muscle tissue is possible using reverse protein arrays. This technology may not only be of interest for diagnostic purposes, but also for protein quantification of multiple, follow-up biopsies during clinical trials when protein expression in muscle is considered an important outcome measure or biomarker.",,,,2010-03-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

DMD is the most common genetic form of muscular dystrophy in childhood. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate modalities of treatment. The NMM was developed based on interviews of patients with DMD and spinal muscular atrophy. To determine the PedsQL reliability and validity, we administered the NMM to patients with DMD and their caregivers.
Boys 8 to 18 years old with DMD were recruited from a neuromuscular disease clinic. At baseline, the child and caregiver completed the NMM and the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (GC). The NMM was repeated 2 to 6 weeks later. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha (internal consistency) and intraclass correlation (ICC) (test-retest consistency). Construct validity was assessed by comparing baseline child and caregiver NMM total scores with the GC Total Score, forced vital capacity, cardiac ejection fraction, and ambulatory status.
Forty-four children and their caregivers completed the study. Internal consistency reliability of the total scale score of the NMM was demonstrated (Child alpha = 0.85; Caregiver alpha = 0.87). Test-retest reliability of the NMM was also demonstrated (Child ICC = 0.75, P = 0.001; Caregiver ICC = 0.85, P < 0.001). Validity of the total scale score of the NMM when compared with the GC Total Scale Score was supported (Child r (41) = 0.63, P < 0.001; Caregiver r (42) = 0.64, P < 0.001). Validity of the NMM compared with forced vital capacity was also supported (Child r (38) = 0.35, P = 0.032; Caregiver r (39) = 0.41, P = 0.01).

20170628,Morpholinos and their peptide conjugates: therapeutic promise and challenge for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Biochimica et biophysica acta,"Exon-skipping efficacies of phosphodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) or the conjugates of PMOs with cell-penetrating peptides (PPMOs) have been tested in various animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), including mdx mice, utrophin-dystrophin double-knockout mice, and CXMD dogs, as well as in DMD patients in clinical trials. The studies have shown that PMOs can diffuse into leaky muscle cells, modify splicing of DMD transcripts, induce expression of partially functional dystrophin, and improve function of some skeletal muscles. PMOs are non-toxic, with a report of mdx mice tolerating a 3g/kg dose, and no drug-related safety issue in human has been reported. However, because of their poor cell uptake and rapid renal clearance, large and frequently repeated doses of PMOs are likely required for functional benefit in some skeletal muscles of DMD patients. In addition, PMOs do not enter cardiomyocytes sufficiently to relieve heart pathology, the efficacy of delivery to various muscles varies greatly, and delivery across the tissue of each skeletal muscle tissue is patchy. PPMOs enter cells at far lower doses, enter cardiomyocytes in useful quantities, and deliver more evenly to myocytes both when different muscles are compared and when assessed at the level of single muscle tissue sections. Compared to PMOs, far lower doses of PPMOs can restore dystrophin sufficiently to reduce disease pathology, increase skeletal and cardiac muscle functions, and prolong survival of animals. The biggest challenge for PPMO is determining safe and effective doses. The toxicity of PPMOs will require caution when moving into the clinic. The first PPMO-based DMD drug is currently in preclinical development for DMD patients who can benefit from skipping exon 50.",,,,2010-02-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for increasing ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in neuromuscular disease. Outcomes included ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, functional improvement, foot alignment, foot and ankle muscle strength, health-related quality of life, satisfaction with the intervention and adverse events.
Two authors independently selected papers, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
Four studies involving 149 participants met inclusion criteria for this review. Two studies assessed the effect of night splinting in a total of 26 children and adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between wearing a night splint and not wearing a night splint. One study assessed the efficacy of prednisone treatment in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. While a daily dose of prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg/day resulted in significant improvements in some strength and function parameters compared with placebo, there was no significant difference in ankle range of motion between groups. Increasing the prednisone dose to 1.5 mg/kg/day had no significant effect on ankle range of motion. One study evaluated early surgery in 20 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Surgery resulted in increased ankle dorsiflexion range at 12 months but functional outcomes favoured the control group. By 24 months, many boys in the surgical group experienced a relapse of achilles tendon contractures.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common childhood genetic disease, affecting one in 3500 newborn boys, causing progressive muscle weakness, heart and respiratory failure and premature death. No cure exists for this disease and a number of promising new molecular therapies are being intensively studied. Duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to mutations that disrupt the open-reading-frame in the DMD gene leading to the absence of the essential muscle protein dystrophin. Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. Recently this method was shown to be promising and safe in clinical trials both in The Netherlands and the UK. These trials studied direct antisense oligonucleotide injections into single peripheral lower limb muscles, whereas a viable therapy will need antisense oligonucleotides to be delivered systemically to all muscles, most critically to the heart, and ultimately to all other affected tissues including brain. There has also been considerable progress in understanding how such splice-correction methods could be applied to the treatment of related neuromuscular diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy, where defects of splicing or alternative splicing are closely related to the disease mechanism.",,,,2010-02-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
20145676,Therapeutic exon skipping for dysferlinopathies?,,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,"Antisense-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) currently tested in clinical trials. The aim is to reframe dystrophin transcripts using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). These hide an exon from the splicing machinery to induce exon skipping, restoration of the reading frame and generation of internally deleted, but partially functional proteins. It thus relies on the characteristic of the dystrophin protein, which has essential N- and C-terminal domains, whereas the central rod domain is largely redundant. This approach may also be applicable to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Myoshi myopathy (MM) and distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT), which are caused by mutations in the dysferlin-encoding DYSF gene. Dysferlin has a function in repairing muscle membrane damage. Dysferlin contains calcium-dependent C2 lipid binding (C2) domains and an essential transmembrane domain. However, mildly affected patients in whom one or a large number of DYSF exons were missing have been described, suggesting that internally deleted dysferlin proteins can be functional. Thus, exon skipping might also be applicable as a LGMD2B, MM and DMAT therapy. In this study we have analyzed the dysferlin protein domains and DYSF mutations and have described what exons are promising targets with regard to applicability and feasibility. We also show that DYSF exon skipping seems to be as straightforward as DMD exon skipping, as AONs to induce efficient skipping of four DYSF exons were readily identified.",,,,2010-02-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

20072625,A duchenne muscular dystrophy gene hot spot mutation in dystrophin-deficient cavalier king charles spaniels is amenable to exon 51 skipping.,,PloS one,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which afflicts 1 in 3500 boys, is one of the most common genetic disorders of children. This fatal degenerative condition is caused by an absence or deficiency of dystrophin in striated muscle. Most affected patients have inherited or spontaneous deletions in the dystrophin gene that disrupt the reading frame resulting in unstable truncated products. For these patients, restoration of the reading frame via antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach. The major DMD deletion ""hot spot"" is found between exons 45 and 53, and skipping exon 51 in particular is predicted to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in the greatest number of patients. Currently the mdx mouse is the most widely used animal model of DMD, although its mild phenotype limits its suitability in clinical trials. The Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model has a severe phenotype, but due to its large size, is expensive to use. Both these models have mutations in regions of the dystrophin gene distant from the commonly mutated DMD ""hot spot"".
Here we describe the severe phenotype, histopathological findings, and molecular analysis of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy (CKCS-MD). The dogs harbour a missense mutation in the 5' donor splice site of exon 50 that results in deletion of exon 50 in mRNA transcripts and a predicted premature truncation of the translated protein. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 51 in cultured myoblasts from an affected dog restored the reading frame and protein expression.
Given the small size of the breed, the amiable temperament and the nature of the mutation, we propose that CKCS-MD is a valuable new model for clinical trials of antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping and other therapeutic approaches for DMD.",,,,2010-01-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

There is no longer any doubt that antisense oligomers can redirect dystrophin gene processing and by-pass protein truncating mutations after direct injection into muscle. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in human dystrophic muscle, with trials in Leiden and London showing that two different oligomer chemistries can restore the reading-frame in selected DMD patients by excising dystrophin exon 51. Systemic delivery of both oligomer types into DMD patients has commenced with promising results but it remains to be established if this therapy will have measurable clinical benefits. Targeted removal of exon 51 will only be directly applicable to about one in ten DMD individuals, and the immediate challenges include development of appropriate and effective delivery regimens, and extending splice-switching therapies to other dystrophin gene lesions. The success of induced exon skipping has spawned a number of ""fusion therapies"", including vector-mediated dystrophin exon skipping and ex vivo viral delivery of splice-switching antisense molecules into myogenic stem cells, followed by implantation, which may address long term oligomer delivery issues. This review summarizes the pivotal events leading to the completion of the first proof-of-concept trials and speculates on some of the scientific, ethical, regulatory and commercial challenges facing targeted exon skipping for the treatment of DMD.",,,,2010-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
20030232,[Establishment of an evaluation method for muscular dystrophy and a patient registration system for clinical trials].,,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,"About 20 years have passed since the discovery of the causative protein of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in 1987, and treatments targeting causative factors such as exon skipping, read-through of stop codons, and the upregulation of utrophin are approaching practical levels. In Japan, also, clinical trials are planned as the final stage of treatment development. In this field, an appropriate outcome measure has not been established due to the lack of experience in clinical trials. Treatments for muscular dystrophy are deemed effective only when increases in the muscle mass and muscle strength and improvements in the ADL and QOL as well as biological marker levels at target points have been demonstrated. The Muscular Dystrophy Clinical Study Group has addressed the development of these evaluation methods since 2002. Also, as treatments for muscular dystrophy being developed today are so-called tailor-made treatments aimed at specific mutations, a system that facilitates identification of the type and site of mutation in each individual must be prepared. The Gene Analysis Center was only just established in the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry in 2009. Also, it is expected to be difficult to secure a sufficient number of subjects to start a clinical trial in a short period. Therefore, the Registry of Muscular Dystrophy (REMUDY), a system for the registration of patients with muscular dystrophy including their clinical and genetic information was implemented. This system, which provides information concerning the number of patients required by the protocol to researchers and pharmaceutical companies and the latest information regarding the development of treatments to patients, is expected to serve as a prototype for the establishment of the basis of clinical trials against rare diseases.",,,,2009-12-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
20030230,[Exon skipping therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy by using antisense Morpholino].,,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the lack of dystrophin protein at the sarcolemma. Exon skipping by antisense oligonucleotides is a novel method to restore the reading frame of the mutated DMD gene, and rescue dystrophin production. We recently reported that systemic delivery of Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeting exon 6 and 8 of the canine DMD gene, efficiently recovered functional dystrophin proteins at the sarcolamma of dystrophic dogs, and improved performance of affected dogs without serious side effects (Yokota et al., Ann Neurol. 65 (6): 667-676, 2009). To optimize therapeutic antisense Morpholinos for more frequent mutations of the DMD gene, we designed antisense Morpholinos targeting exon 51 of the mouse DMD gene, and injected them separately or in combination into the muscles of mdx52 mice, in which exon 52 has been deleted by a gene targeting technique (Araki et al., 1997). We also tried systemic delivery of antisense Morpholino to skip exon 51 in mdx52 mice. It is important to verify the effectiveness and side effects of antisense Morpholino in experimental animal models such as dystrophic dogs or mdx52 mice, before clinical trials in DMD patients.",,,,2009-12-25,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
20021451,Personalised genetic intervention for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: antisense oligomers and exon skipping.,,Current molecular pharmacology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) arises from protein-truncating mutations in the large dystrophin gene that preclude synthesis of a functional protein that primarily stabilizes muscle fibre membranes. The absence of dystrophin leads to this most common and serious form of childhood muscle-wasting. Since the identification of the dystrophin gene in 1987, cell and gene repair or replacement therapies have been evaluated for DMD treatment and one genetic intervention, exon skipping, is now in clinical trials. Antisense oligomers have been designed to redirect dystrophin splicing patterns so that targeted exons may be removed from a defective dystrophin pre-mRNA to either restore the reading frame of a deletion, or excise an in-frame exon corrupted by a nonsense mutation or micro-insertion/deletion. This review discusses the evolution of oligomer induced exon skipping, including in vitro applications, evaluation of different oligomer chemistries, the treatment of animal models and alternative exon skipping strategies involving viral expression cassettes and ex vivo manipulation of stem cells. The discussion culminates with the current clinical trials and the great challenges that lie ahead. The major obstacle to the implementation of personalised genetic treatments to address the many different mutations that can lead to DMD, are considered to be establishing effective treatments for the different patients and their mutations. Furthermore, the view of regulatory authorities in assessing preclinical data on potentially scores of different but class-specific compounds will be of paramount importance in expediting the clinical application of exon skipping therapy for this serious and relentlessly progressive muscle wasting disease.",,,,2009-12-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In order to search for small molecule and genetic modulators of AON-dependent and independent exon skipping, we screened approximately 10,000 known small molecule drugs, >17,000 cDNA clones, and >2,000 kinase- targeted siRNAs against a 5.6 kb luciferase minigene construct, encompassing exon 71 to exon 73 of human dystrophin. As a result, we identified several enhancers of exon skipping, acting on both the reporter construct as well as endogenous dystrophin in mdx cells. Multiple mechanisms of action were identified, including histone deacetylase inhibition, tubulin modulation and pre-mRNA processing. Among others, the nucleolar protein NOL8 and staufen RNA binding protein homolog 2 (Stau2) were found to induce endogenous exon skipping in mdx cells in an AON-dependent fashion. An unexpected but recurrent theme observed in our screening efforts was the apparent link between the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of exon skipping.",,,,2009-12-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We selected 28 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The patients were receiving noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support and presented FVC values < 60% of predicted. Peak cough flow (PCF) was measured, with the patient seated, at four time points: at baseline, during a spontaneous maximal expiratory effort (MEE); during an MEE while receiving chest compression; during an MEE after air stacking with a manual resuscitation bag; and during an MEE with air stacking and compression (combined technique). The last three measurements were conducted in random order. The results were compared using Pearson's correlation test and ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by Tukey's post-hoc test (p < 0.05).
The mean age of the patients was 20 + or - 4 years, and the mean FVC was 29 + or - 12%.

19907501,"Dystrophin restoration in skeletal, heart and skin arrector pili smooth muscle of mdx mice by ZM2 NP-AON complexes.",,Gene therapy,"Potentially viable therapeutic approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are now within reach. Indeed, clinical trials are currently under way. Two crucial aspects still need to be addressed: maximizing therapeutic efficacy and identifying appropriate and sensible outcome measures. Nevertheless, the end point of these trials remains painful muscle biopsy to show and quantify protein restoration in treated boys. In this study we show that PMMA/N-isopropil-acrylamide+ (NIPAM) nanoparticles (ZM2) bind and convey antisense oligoribonucleotides (AONs) very efficiently. Systemic injection of the ZM2-AON complex restored dystrophin protein synthesis in both skeletal and cardiac muscles of mdx mice, allowing protein localization in up to 40% of muscle fibers. The mdx exon 23 skipping level was up to 20%, as measured by the RealTime assay, and dystrophin restoration was confirmed by both reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, we verified that dystrophin restoration also occurs in the smooth muscle cells of the dorsal skin arrector pili, an easily accessible histological structure, in ZM2-AON-treated mdx mice, with respect to untreated animals. This finding reveals arrector pili smooth muscle to be an appealing biomarker candidate and a novel low-invasive treatment end point. Furthermore, this marker would also be suitable for subsequent monitoring of the therapeutic effects in DMD patients. In addition, we demonstrate herein the expression of other sarcolemma proteins such as alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-sarcoglycans in the human skin arrector pili smooth muscle, thereby showing the potential of this muscle as a biomarker for other muscular dystrophies currently or soon to be the object of clinical trials.",,,,2009-11-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) provide the ideal model to optimize vector delivery across a vascular barrier and provide accurate dose estimates for widespread transduction. To address vascular delivery and dosing in rhesus macaques, we have generated a fusion construct that encodes an eight amino-acid FLAG epitope at the C-terminus of micro-dystrophin to facilitate translational studies targeting DMD. Intramuscular (IM) injection of AAV8.MCK.micro-dys.FLAG in the tibialis anterior (TA) of macaques demonstrated robust gene expression, with muscle transduction (50-79%) persisting for up to 5 months. Success by IM injection was followed by targeted vascular delivery studies using a fluoroscopy-guided catheter threaded through the femoral artery. Three months after gene transfer, >80% of muscle fibers showed gene expression in the targeted muscle. No cellular immune response to AAV8 capsid, micro-dystrophin, or the FLAG tag was detected by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) at any time point with either route. In summary, an epitope-tagged micro-dystrophin cassette enhances the ability to evaluate site-specific localization and distribution of gene expression in the NHP in preparation for vascular delivery clinical trials.",,,,2009-11-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The purpose of this study was to describe the use and reliability of accelerometry in gait assessment of dogs with muscular dystrophy. Eight healthy and 11 GRMD adult dogs underwent three gait assessment sessions, using accelerometry. Three-axial recordings of accelerations were performed, and gait variables calculated. Total power, force and regularity of accelerations, stride length and speed, normalized by height at withers, stride frequency, and cranio-caudal power were significantly decreased, whereas medio-lateral power was significantly increased in GRMD dogs. Moreover, these variables were repeatable within and between sessions. Accelerometry provides reliable variables which highlight specific gait patterns of GRMD dogs, describing objectively and quantitatively their slow, short-stepped, and swaying gait. As it is easy to set-up, quick to perform and inexpensive, accelerometry represents a useful tool, to assess locomotion during pre-clinical trials.",,,,2009-10-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
19796079,Development of antisense-mediated exon skipping as a treatment for duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-wasting disease caused by frame shifting and nonsense mutations in the dystrophin gene. Through skipping of an (additional) exon from the pre-mRNA, the reading frame can be restored. This can be achieved with antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), which induce exon skipping by binding to splice sites or splice enhancer sites. The resulting protein will be shorter but at least partially functional. So far, exon skipping has been very successful in cell cultures, in mouse and dog models, and even in a first exploratory study in patients. Current research mainly focuses on optimization of systemic AON delivery. Here we give an overview of the available mouse models. To obtain the most informative results for future clinical application, research may have to move from the currently preferred mdx mouse to mouse models more comparable to patients, such as the utrophin/dystrophin-negative mouse and the hDMD mouse models. Further, we briefly discuss two AON backbone chemistries that are currently in clinical trials for DMD exon skipping. We propose that different chemistries should be further developed in parallel in order to hasten the transfer of the exon skipping therapy to the clinic.",,,,2009-10-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
19751179,Clinical applications of creatine supplementation on paediatrics.,,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,"Creatine plays a central role in energy metabolism and is synthesized in the liver, kidney and pancreas. In healthy patients, it is transported via the blood stream to the muscles, heart and brain with high and fluctuating energy demands by the molecule creatine transporter. Creatine, although naturally synthesized in the human body, can be ingested in the form of supplements and is commonly used by athletes. The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical applications of creatine supplementation on paediatrics. Creatine metabolism disorders have so far been described at the level of two synthetic steps, guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT) and arginine: glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), and at the level of the creatine transporter 1(CrT1). GAMT and AGAT deficiency respond positively to substitutive treatment with creatine monohydrate whereas in CrT1 defect, it is not able to replenish creatine in the brain with oral creatine supplementation. There are also data concerning the short and long-term therapeutic benefit of creatine supplementation in children and adults with gyrate atrophy (a result of the inborn error of metabolism with ornithine delta- aminotransferase activity), muscular dystrophy (facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, Becker dystrophy, Duchenne dystrophy and sarcoglycan deficient limb girdle muscular dystrophy), McArdle's disease, Huntington's disease and mitochondria-related diseases.

Neurology,"Mutations that disrupt the open reading frame and prevent full translation of DMD, the gene that encodes dystrophin, underlie the fatal X-linked disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oligonucleotides targeted to splicing elements (splice switching oligonucleotides) in DMD pre-mRNA can lead to exon skipping, restoration of the open reading frame, and the production of functional dystrophin in vitro and in vivo, which could benefit patients with this disorder.
We did a single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in patients with DMD recruited nationally, to assess the safety and biochemical efficacy of an intramuscular morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide (AVI-4658) that skips exon 51 in dystrophin mRNA. Seven patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy with deletions in the open reading frame of DMD that are responsive to exon 51 skipping were selected on the basis of the preservation of their extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle seen on MRI and the response of cultured fibroblasts from a skin biopsy to AVI-4658. AVI-4658 was injected into the EDB muscle; the contralateral muscle received saline. Muscles were biopsied between 3 and 4 weeks after injection. The primary endpoint was the safety of AVI-4658 and the secondary endpoint was its biochemical efficacy. This trial is registered, number NCT00159250.
Two patients received 0.09 mg AVI-4658 in 900 microL (0.9%) saline and five patients received 0.9 mg AVI-4658 in 900 microL saline. No adverse events related to AVI-4658 administration were reported. Intramuscular injection of the higher-dose of AVI-4658 resulted in increased dystrophin expression in all treated EDB muscles, although the results of the immunostaining of EDB-treated muscle for dystrophin were not uniform. In the areas of the immunostained sections that were adjacent to the needle track through which AVI-4658 was given, 44-79% of myofibres had increased expression of dystrophin. In randomly chosen sections of treated EDB muscles, the mean intensity of dystrophin staining ranged from 22% to 32% of the mean intensity of dystrophin in healthy control muscles (mean 26.4%), and the mean intensity was 17% (range 11-21%) greater than the intensity in the contralateral saline-treated muscle (one-sample paired t test p=0.002). In the dystrophin-positive fibres, the intensity of dystrophin staining was up to 42% of that in healthy muscle. We showed expression of dystrophin at the expected molecular weight in the AVI-4658-treated muscle by immunoblot.
Intramuscular AVI-4658 was safe and induced the expression of dystrophin locally within treated muscles. This proof-of-concept study has led to an ongoing systemic clinical trial of AVI-4658 in patients with DMD.

DMD is characterized by a deficiency of the muscle dystrophin as a result of mutations in the dystrophin gene. Currently, no effective treatment for DMD is available. Two promising treatments strategies have been proposed specifically for correcting the mutations in the dystrophin gene. Induction of exon skipping using antisense oligonucleotides is expected to correct the out-of-frame mutation into in-frame mutation of the translational reading frame of dystrophin mRNA. This strategy enables the production of truncated dystrophin production in DMD patients with out-of-frame exon-deletion mutations in the dystrophin gene. Our first treatment with antisense oligonucleotides against exon 19 was successful and resulted in the production of dystrophin in the skeletal muscle of a DMD patient with exon 20 deletion. It is anticipated that exon skipping will be applied extensively for the correction of deletion mutations. Induction of the read-through effect using gentamycin or PTC124 is expected to produce dystrophin in DMD patients with nonsense mutation. The treatment with PTC124 is currently under clinical trial.

The scale was specifically designed for ambulant children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and includes 17 items that are relevant for this cohort. Thirteen Italian centers participated in the study. In the first phase of the study we provided two training videos and an example of the scale performed on a child. After the first session of training, all the 13 examiners were asked to send a video with an assessment performed in their centre and to score all the videos collected. There were no difficulties in performing the items and in obtaining adequate videos with a hand held camera but the results showed a poor interobserver reliability (<.5). After a second training session with review and discussion of the videos previously scored, the same examiners were asked to score three new videos. The results of this session had an excellent interobserver reliability (.995). The level of agreement was maintained even when the same videos were rescored after a month, showing a significant intra-observer reliability (.95).

So far, there is no effective treatment but new gene-based therapies are currently being developed with particular noted advances in using conventional gene replacement strategies, RNA-based approaches, or cell-based gene therapy with a main focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy and current treatments are far from adequate.

Proof-of-concept of exon skipping has been obtained in animal models, and most recently in clinical trials; this approach represents a promising therapy for a subset of patients. In addition, gene-delivery-based strategies exist both for antisense-induced reading frame restoration, and for highly efficient delivery of functional dystrophin mini- and micro-genes to muscle fibres in vivo and muscle stem cells ex-vivo.

Validity was established in a group of patients aged 6-60 years with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy being the most frequent diagnosis in the population tested.
Our aim was to check the validity of the MFM in a hospital department specialized in neuromuscular diseases in the follow-up of adult out-patients presenting a myopathy, such population being very different from the MFM validation group in terms of age and sub-groups of myopathy.
One hundred patients were randomly selected in the Reference Center for Neuromuscular Diseases of Nice (France) between 2005 and 2007. Were collected: the MFM score, manual muscular testing (MMT) of lower and upper limb, face and spine, Brooke and Vignos scores. MFM and its three dimensions D1 (standing position and transfers), D2 (axial and proximal limb motor function) and D3 (distal motor function) were compared to the other scores with the Spearman Correlation Coefficient and the Principal Component Analysis.
Patients were aged 18-78 years. The most frequent diagnoses were Steinert's Muscular Dystrophy (DM1) and Facio-ScapuloHumeral Dystrophy (FSHD) (30% and 29%). MFM was significantly correlated to all other scores except for Face MMT. However, Face MMT was correlated to D1 and D2 in DM1 patients and to D2 in FSHD patients.
Our results confirm the validity of the MFM in adult patients with muscular diseases. However, the MFM global score and its three dimensions D1, D2 and D3 are variously correlated with the facial and axial muscle testing.

19523340,Growth factor coinjection improves the migration potential of monkey myogenic precursors without affecting cell transplantation success.,,Cell transplantation,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited disease and a main target of myogenic cell transplantation (MT). After the failure of the first clinical trials with DMD patients, the poor migration of transplanted cells has been suspected to be a major problem for a more effective clinical application of MT. Previous investigations suggested that the quantity and dispersion of myofibers containing donor cell nuclei might be improved by increasing the migration of the transplanted cells outside the injection sites. Because the coinjection of motogenic factors with human myoblasts enhanced their intramuscular migration following MT in SCID mice, the present study aimed to investigate whether this approach was appropriate to increase MT success in muscles of nonhuman primates. In vitro studies indicated that IGF-1 or bFGF increased components of proteolytic systems involved in myoblast migration. In vitro and in vivo experiments also demonstrated that coinjection of bFGF or IGF-1 was able to improve monkey myogenic cell migration and invasion. Sixty hours after MT in skeletal muscle tissue, the migration distances reached by monkey myoblasts increased by nearly twofold when one of the growth factors was coinjected with the cells. However, long-term observations in adult monkeys suggest that promigratory treatments are not intrinsically sufficient to improve the success of MT. Even if short-term observations reveal that grafted cells are not always trapped inside the injection site and in spite of the fact that both factors enhanced transplanted cell migration, myofibers including grafted cell nuclei were still restrained to the injection trajectory without notable difference in their amount or their dispersion. The incapacity of transplanted cells to fuse with undamaged myofibers, which are located outside the injection sites, is a priority problem to solve in order to improve transplantation success and reduce the number of injections required for the treatment of DMD patients.",,,,2009-06-16,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Study participants (n = 42) had a mean age of 15.5 yr, a short stature (height -2.4 SD), a relatively high BMI (+1.7 SD), and a high body fat fraction (41.9% or +2.8 SD). Abdominal CT confirmed the high fat mass and disclosed a high fraction of visceral fat. As expected, insulin resistance was increased. As compared to placebo, metformin intake for 6 months exerted an insulin sensitizing effect and lowered weight (mean difference of 2 kg within 6 months, p = 0.007) and BMI (p = 0.016). Weight loss appeared to be primarily due to loss of visceral fat ( approximately 20% vs. placebo; p < 0.0001). Results were similar across diagnostic subgroups. In conclusion, metformin treatment for 6 months was associated with a rise in insulin sensitivity and with a reduction of visceral adiposity in children and adolescents with a primary muscle disorder or with a neural tube defect.

19486303,Exon-skipping therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene for which no mutation-targeted therapy has been available thus far. However, exon-skipping mediated by antisense oligonucleotides (AOs), which are short single-strand DNAs, has considerable potential for DMD therapy, and clinical trials in DMD patients are currently underway. This exon-skipping therapy changes an out-of-frame mutation into an in-frame mutation, aiming at conversion of a severe DMD phenotype into a mild phenotype by restoration of truncated dystrophin expression. Recently, stable and less-toxic AOs have been developed, and their higher efficacy was confirmed in mice and dog models of DMD. In this review, we briefly summarize the genetic basis of DMD and the potential and perspectives of exon skipping as a promising therapy for this disease.",,,,2009-06-03,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Three studies were performed. Two studies included only physiotherapy-treated patients, with 13 patients (males mean age 11y 7mo, SD 1y 10mo, range 8-14y) in the 3-month study and 41 patients (males mean age 14y 1mo, SD 5y 5mo, range 6-32y) in the 1-year study. A third study compared 12 patients treated with steroids with 12 age- and motor-function-matched untreated patients (males mean age of treated patients 10y 2mo, SD 2y 2mo range 6-14) over a 12-month period.
Over 3 months, the MFM D1 subscore (standing and transfers) decreased significantly (-4.7%; p<0.01). Over 1 year, all MFM subscores decreased significantly: -4.9% for D1 (p<0.01); -7.7% for D2 (axial and proximal motor capacity; p<0.01); -4.3% for D3 (distal motor capacity; p=0.03); and -5.8% for the total score (p<0.01). A threshold value for loss of ambulation and a predictive value 1 year before loss were estimated (total score 70% and D1 subscore 40%). Compared with the controls, patients treated with steroids had more stable total scores (-0.59 vs -5.87; p=0.02) and D2 subscores (0.98 vs -8.50; p<0.01).
These results support the use of the MFM in everyday patient management to prepare for loss of ambulation and in clinical trials to follow up patients receiving various treatments.","Three studies were performed.

19440974,Identification of three distinguishable phenotypes in golden retriever muscular dystrophy.,,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a human disease characterized by progressive and irreversible skeletal muscle degeneration caused by mutations in genes coding for important muscle proteins. Unfortunately, there is no efficient treatment for this disease; it causes progressive loss of motor and muscular ability until death. The canine model (golden retriever muscular dystrophy) is similar to DMD, showing similar clinical signs. Fifteen dogs were followed from birth and closely observed for clinical signs. Dogs had their disease status confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis and genotyping. Clinical observations of musculoskeletal, morphological, gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal features allowed us to identify three distinguishable phenotypes in dystrophic dogs: mild (grade I), moderate (grade II) and severe (grade III). These three groups showed no difference in dystrophic alterations of muscle morphology and creatine kinase levels. This information will be useful for therapeutic trials, because DMD also shows significant, inter- and intra-familiar clinical variability. Additionally, being aware of phenotypic differences in this animal model is essential for correct interpretation and understanding of results obtained in pre-clinical trials.",,,,2009-05-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We evaluated the functional benefit of 4 months oral glutamine in DMD.
30 ambulant DMD boys were included in this double-blind, randomized crossover trial with 2 intervention periods: glutamine (0.5 g/kg/d) and placebo, 4 months each, separated by a 1-month wash-out, at 3 outpatient clinical investigation centers in France. Functional benefit was tested by comparing glutamine versus placebo on change in walking speed at 4 months. Secondary outcome measures were: 2-minute walk test, work, power, muscle mass (urinary creatinine), markers of myofibrillar protein breakdown (urinary 3-methyl-histidine/creatinine), serum creatine phospho-kinase, body composition (fat free mass, fat mass percentage), safety and oral nutrient intake. There was no improvement in the primary end point (walking speed) or in secondary measures of muscle function (2-minute walk test, work, power) in the glutamine group compared with placebo. However, subjects receiving glutamine or placebo showed no deterioration in functional measures over the course of the 9-month trial. No differences in muscle mass, markers of protein breakdown or serum creatine phosho-kinase were observed, except for a blunted increase in fat free mass in the glutamine group which led to a greater increase in fat mass percentage. Glutamine was safe and well-tolerated.
This trial did not identify additional benefit of 4 months oral glutamine over placebo on muscle mass or function in ambulatory DMD boys. Although apparently safe, current data cannot support routine supplementation in this population as a whole, until further research proves otherwise.

This is most applicable to the majority of cases which arise when genetic defects cause frame shift mutations, and induced exon skipping of out-of-phase exons restores the reading frame. However, the consequences to the edited protein so produced have not been considered. In many cases alternative routes to restoring the reading frame are possible, and we show in a test case involving exon 44 that the resulting differently edited proteins greatly vary in stability, with one of them very similar to normal unskipped dystrophin, and the other much less stable as assessed by the thermodynamics of folding as well as resistance to proteolysis. This has implications for the design of optimal therapeutic exon skipping strategies, which presumably wish to result repairs with as much fidelity to normal dystrophin as possible.",,,,2009-03-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The objective of this study was to identify the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic origin of these alterations.
Twenty-five male patients (15 with DMD, 10 controls, aged 10-18 years) were studied. Patients were anaesthetized with propofol and sufentanil. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored by acceleromyography. Patients received a single intravenous dose of 0.3 mg kg(-1) rocuronium. In five patients of the DMD group, pharmacokinetic modelling was performed from arterial rocuronium concentrations. The time course of neuromuscular block was analysed with a sigmoid E(max) model including an effect compartment.
The pharmacokinetics of rocuronium in DMD patients were Vc 63 +/- 14 ml kg(-1), Cl 3.0 +/- 1.0 ml min(-1) kg(-1), half-lives 2.0 +/- 0.6, 20 +/- 10 and 129 +/- 98 min, SE.

This approach is mutation specific, but as the majority of DMD patients have deletions that cluster in hotspot regions, the skipping of a small number of exons is applicable to relatively large numbers of patients. To assess the actual applicability of the exon skipping approach, we here determined for deletions, duplications and point mutations reported in the Leiden DMD mutation database, which exon(s) should be skipped to restore the open reading frame. In theory, single and double exon skipping would be applicable to 79% of deletions, 91% of small mutations, and 73% of duplications, amounting to 83% of all DMD mutations. Exon 51 skipping, which is being tested in clinical trials, would be applicable to the largest group (13%) of all DMD patients. Further research is needed to determine the functionality of different in-frame dystrophins and a number of hurdles has to be overcome before this approach can be applied clinically.",,,,2009-01-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

This article focuses on two severe forms of muscular dystrophies and provides genetic data for a large cohort of Hungarian patients diagnosed within the last few years by the authors. The Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which is located on chromosome Xp21. The genetic analysis of dystrophin is usually performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects approximately 95% of all deletions but does not distinguish between one and two copies of the exons investigated. The present work, therefore, concentrates on the improvement of the diagnostic panel for the analysis of DMD/BMD in Hungary. Radioactively labelled cDNA probes, encompassing the whole dystrophin gene detect all the deletions and the analysis is quantitative. In addition, the new multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique was recently introduced that enabled more reliable and faster quantitative detection of the entire dystrophin gene. The genomic basis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is associated with contraction of the D4Z4 repeat region in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. In case of FSHD, molecular genetic criteria still have to be improved because of the complexity of the disorder.",,,,2008-11-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
18974551,"Exon skipping and Duchenne muscular dystrophy: hope, hype and how feasible?",,Neurology India,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common and serious form of childhood muscle wasting is generally caused by protein-truncating mutations in the large DMD gene. Specific removal of an exon from a defective DMD gene transcript has the potential to allow synthesis of a semi-functional dystrophin, thereby reducing the severity and presumably progression of muscle wasting. The efficacy of this treatment will vary greatly between the different mutations that preclude the synthesis of a functional dystrophin. Restoration of the reading frame from a large multi-exon genomic deletion, typically greater than 36 exons, may lead to synthesis of a protein with only partial function and limited clinical benefit, whereas excising a nonsense mutation in a redundant exon should generate a near normal dystrophin. A clinical trial has recently confirmed proof-of-principle that exclusion of Exon 51 from human dystrophin mRNAs, carrying frame-shifting deletions adjacent to this exon, results in dystrophin expression. No major side-effects after local administration of the antisense oligomer were reported. Additional trials are underway, targeting the same exon but using an oligomer of different backbone chemistry. If functional dystrophin synthesis is demonstrated, and safety issues are addressed, subsequent trials will involve systemic delivery. Great challenges are ahead, some technical; establishing an effective delivery regimen, some ethical; choosing subsequent targets for therapy, and others of an administrative and regulatory nature.",,,,2008-11-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
18843663,Calcium antagonists for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle condition starting in childhood, leading to severe disability and a shortened life span. It is due to severe deficiency of the protein dystrophin which performs both structural and signalling roles within skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Calcium accumulates in dystrophic muscle cells and plays a role in cell damage. It has been hypothesised that use of calcium antagonists might reduce this calcium load and its toxic effect on muscle cells.
To evaluate the effects of calcium antagonists on muscle function and muscle strength in people with DMD.
The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (February 2008), MEDLINE (from January 1950 to March 2008) and EMBASE (from January 1947 to March 2008) were searched. Search terms were 'calcium antagonists' or 'calcium channel blocker' or 'dantrolene' or 'verapamil' or 'nifedipine' or 'flunarizine' or 'diltiazem' or 'amlodipine' or 'nicardipine' and 'Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne'. Bibliographies in reports of any trials were also searched.
All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of any calcium antagonist in people with DMD.
Both authors assessed all identified trials for inclusion in the study on the basis of whether they fulfilled the selection criteria. Both authors extracted data from the trials and assessed the methodological quality. Had there been more than one trial of the same intervention and outcome of sufficient methodological quality, we had planned to undertake a meta-analysis.
Five randomised or quasi-randomised double-blind trials fulfilled the selection criteria, but were not sufficiently comparable to undertake a meta-analysis. The drugs studied were verapamil (8 participants), diltiazem (56 participants), nifedipine (105 participants) and flunarizine (27 participants). There were limitations in the description of blinding and randomisation, and definition of outcome measures. One trial, using verapamil, showed a difference between groups in muscle force measured by ergometry, but also revealed cardiac side effects. The numbers of people included in the trials were low, and so the studies may not have included enough people for sufficient power to detect small differences in muscle force or function between placebo and control groups. In addition, calcium antagonists were in an early stage of development and some of the second generation drugs that have a better side effect profile, such as amlodipine, have not been studied.

We studied the effect of endurance training on conditioning in patients with the dystrophinopathy, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Eleven patients with BMD and seven matched, healthy subjects cycled 50, 30 min sessions at 65% of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) over 12 weeks, and six patients continued cycling for 1 year. VO(2max), muscle biopsies, echocardiography, plasma creatine kinase (CK), lower extremity muscle strength and self-reported questionnaires were evaluated before, after 12 weeks and 1 year of training. Endurance training for 12 weeks, improved VO(2max) by 47 +/- 11% and maximal workload by 80 +/- 19% in patients (P < 0.005). This was significantly higher than in healthy subjects (16 +/- 2% and 17 +/- 2%). CK levels did not increase with training, and number of central nuclei, necrotic fibres and fibres expressing neonatal myosin heavy chain did not change in muscle biopsies. Strength in muscles involved in cycle exercise (knee extension, and dorsi- and plantar-flexion) increased significantly by 13-40%. Cardiac pump function, measured by echocardiography, did not change with training. All improvements and safety markers were maintained after 1 year of training.

Studies using the mdx model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy have found evidence of enhanced mitochondrial function, reduced intra-cellular calcium and improved performance with CrM supplementation. Clinical trials in patients with Duchenne and Becker's muscular dystrophy have shown improved function, fat-free mass, and some evidence of improved bone health with CrM supplementation. In contrast, the improvements in function in myotonic dystrophy and inherited neuropathies (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth) have not been significant. Some studies in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies have shown improved muscle endurance and body composition, yet other studies did not find significant improvements in patients with mitochondrial cytopathy. Lower-dose CrM supplementation in patients with McArdle's disease (myophosphorylase deficiency) improved exercise capacity, yet higher doses actually showed some indication of worsened function. Based upon known cellular pathologies, there are potential benefits from CrM supplementation in patients with steroid myopathy, inflammatory myopathy, myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, and fatty acid oxidation defects. Larger randomized control trials (RCT) using homogeneous patient groups and objective and clinically relevant outcome variables are needed to determine whether creatine supplementation will be of therapeutic benefit to patients with neuromuscular or neurometabolic disorders. Given the relatively low prevalence of some of the neuromuscular and neurometabolic disorders, it will be necessary to use surrogate markers of potential clinical efficacy including markers of oxidative stress, cellular energy charge, and gene expression patterns.",,,,2008-07-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Specific removal of an exon flanking a genomic deletion using antisense oligonucleotide intervention during pre-RNA processing can restore the reading frame and could potentially reduce disease severity. We describe a rare dystrophin gene rearrangement; inversion of approximately 28 kb, flanked by a 10-bp duplication and an 11-kb deletion, which led to the omission of exons 49 and 50 from the mature mRNA and the variable inclusion of several pseudoexons. In vitro transfection of cultured patient cells with antisense oligonucleotides directed at exon 51 induced efficient removal of that exon, as well as one of the more commonly included pseudoexons, suggesting closely coordinated splicing of these exons. Surprisingly, several antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) directed at this pseudoexon had no detectable effect on the splicing pattern, while all AOs directed at the other predominant pseudoexon efficiently excised that target. Antisense oligomers targeting dystrophin exon 51 for removal are currently undergoing clinical trials.

18386226,The therapeutic potential of antisense-mediated exon skipping.,,Current opinion in molecular therapeutics,"Antisense-mediated exon skipping is an approach that uses antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) to modulate splicing by hiding specific sites essential for exon inclusion from the splicing machinery. AONs that block aberrant splice sites can restore normal splicing, whereas AONs targeting alternative splice sites can switch splicing patterns from detrimental to beneficial isoforms or produce non-functional mRNAs that lead to gene knockdown. Furthermore, AONs have also been used to restore a disrupted reading frame, thereby generating semi-functional proteins instead of non-functional proteins. Proof-of-concept has been obtained for each of the above AON applications in vitro and for some applications in vivo.

18384691,Nanopolymers improve delivery of exon skipping oligonucleotides and concomitant dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle of mdx mice.,,BMC biotechnology,"Exon skipping oligonucleotides (ESOs) of 2'O-Methyl (2'OMe) and morpholino chemistry have been shown to restore dystrophin expression in muscle fibers from the mdx mouse, and are currently being tested in phase I clinical trials for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). However, ESOs remain limited in their effectiveness because of an inadequate delivery profile. Synthetic cationic copolymers of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are regarded as effective agents for enhanced delivery of nucleic acids in various applications.
We examined whether PEG-PEI copolymers can facilitate ESO-mediated dystrophin expression after intramuscular injections into tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mdx mice. We utilized a set of PEG-PEI copolymers containing 2 kDa PEI and either 550 Da or 5 kDa PEG, both of which bind 2'OMe ESOs with high affinity and form stable nanoparticulates with a relatively low surface charge. Three weekly intramuscular injections of 5 microg of ESO complexed with PEI2K-PEG550 copolymers resulted in about 500 dystrophin-positive fibers and about 12% of normal levels of dystrophin expression at 3 weeks after the initial injection, which is significantly greater than for injections of ESO alone, which are known to be almost completely ineffective. In an effort to enhance biocompatibility and cellular uptake, the PEI2K-PEG550 and PEI2K-PEG5K copolymers were functionalized by covalent conjugation with nanogold (NG) or adsorbtion of colloidal gold (CG), respectively. Surprisingly, using the same injection and dosing regimen, we found no significant difference in dystrophin expression by Western blot between the NG-PEI2K-PEG550, CG-PEI2K-PEG5K, and non-functionalized PEI2K-PEG550 copolymers. Dose-response experiments using the CG-PEI2K-PEG5K copolymer with total ESO ranging from 3-60 microg yielded a maximum of about 15% dystrophin expression. Further improvements in dystrophin expression up to 20% of normal levels were found at 6 weeks after 10 twice-weekly injections of the NG-PEI2K-PEG550 copolymer complexed with 5 microg of ESO per injection. This injection and dosing regimen showed over 1000 dystrophin-positive fibers. H&E staining of all treated muscle groups revealed no overt signs of cytotoxicity.
We conclude that PEGylated PEI2K copolymers are efficient carriers for local delivery of 2'OMe ESOs and warrant further development as potential therapeutics for treatment of DMD.",,"We examined whether PEG-PEI copolymers can facilitate ESO-mediated dystrophin expression after intramuscular injections into tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mdx mice.

Twenty-eight Duchenne muscular dystrophy subjects with proven dystrophin gene mutations were enrolled. Included were 14 ambulatory and 14 nonambulatory patients with approximately half of each cohort taking corticosteroids. Twenty normal males served as controls. Initial blood samples for serum GGT and creatine kinase were taken between 8AM and 9AM and redrawn 8 hours later to test for variability. Between blood draws, subjects resumed normal activities in a play environment or could leave the clinic. Not a single duchenne muscular dystrophy patient showed a GGT outside the control range at any time point, while creatine kinase levels were 14 to 200 times normal.

18279756,Deflazacort use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: an 8-year follow-up.,,Pediatric neurology,"Data reported here were collected over an 8-year period for 79 Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, 37 of whom were treated with deflazacort. Mean length of treatment was 66 months. Treated boys stopped walking at 11.5 +/- 1.9 years, compared with 9.6 +/- 1.4 years for untreated boys. Cardiac function was better preserved with the use of deflazacort, as shown by a normal shortening fraction in treated (30.8 +/- 4.5%) vs untreated boys (26.6 +/- 5.7%, P < 0.05), a higher ejection fraction (52.9 +/- 6.3% treated vs 46 +/- 10% untreated), and lower frequency of dilated cardiomyopathy (32% treated vs 58% untreated). Scoliosis was much less severe in treated (14 +/- 2.5 degrees ) than in untreated boys (46 +/- 24 degrees ). No spinal surgery was necessary in treated boys. Limb fractures were similarly frequent in treated (24%) and untreated (26%) boys, but vertebral fractures occurred only in the treated group (7/37) (compared with zero for the untreated group). In both groups, body weight excess tripled between the ages of 8 and 12 years. All untreated patients grew normally (>4 cm/year), as opposed to only 15% of treated boys. Deflazacort improves cardiac function, prolongs walking, and seems to eliminate the need for spinal surgery, although vertebral fractures and stunted growth occur.

18254031,Glucocorticoid corticosteroids for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscular dystrophy of childhood. This incurable disease is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is one of the major aims of treatment.
The aim of this review was to assess whether glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize or improve muscle strength and walking in boys with DMD.
This is an update of the Cochrane systematic review first published in 2004 (Manzur 2004). We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (August 2006) using the term 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'. We also searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2006), CINAHL and LILACS (January 1982 to August 2006). We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts in this disease to help identify other trials, checked the references in the identified trials and hand searched the abstracts of relevant journals.
Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised trials.
all patients with a definite diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Types of interventions: glucocorticoids such as prednisone, prednisolone, deflazacort or others, with a minimum treatment period of three months.
prolongation of walking (independent walking without long leg calipers).
strength outcome measures, manual muscle strength testing using Medical Research Council strength scores, functional outcome measures and adverse events.
We identified six randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for our review, and one of these (Beenakker 2005) is a new addition to this update, as it was published subsequent to our first review (Manzur 2004). Two review authors independently selected the trials for the review and assessed methodological quality. Data extraction and inputting were double-checked.
data from one small study used prolongation of walking as an outcome measure and did not show significant benefit.
The meta-analysis of the results from four randomised controlled trials with altogether 249 participants showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function over six months. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), nine metres walking time, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade and forced vital capacity. One randomised controlled trial with altogether 28 participants showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize muscle strength and function for up to two years. The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day, given in a daily dose regime. Not enough data were available to compare efficacy of prednisone with deflazacort. Adverse effects: Excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance and excessive hair growth were all more common with glucocorticoid corticosteroids than placebo. Long-term adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy could not be evaluated because of the short-term duration of the randomised studies.Non-randomised studies: A number of non-randomised studies with important efficacy and adverse effects data are tabulated and discussed.
There is evidence from randomised controlled studies that glucocorticoid corticosteroid therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy improves muscle strength and function in the short-term (six months to two years). The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day, given daily. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common but not clinically severe. Long-term benefits and hazards of glucocorticoid treatment cannot be evaluated from the currently published randomised studies. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits but also identify clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment. These benefits and adverse effects have implications for future research studies and clinical practice.",,,,2008-02-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We studied 40 patients with DMD from our university hospital clinic and 80 healthy, age-matched controls. Hand strength was evaluated by handgrip and pinch dynamometries, and by manual testing. Physical disability was measured with a functional scale. Hand weakness was present since early stages in patients with DMD. However, hand strength tended to increase with age in the first decade, although never reaching the control values. Decrease of strength occurred later. Handgrip and pinch dynamometry values were significantly correlated with global hand strength, which were inversely correlated with functional capacity only in the group older than 10 years.

18202836,Animal models for genetic neuromuscular diseases.,,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,"The neuromuscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases, caused by mutations in genes coding sarcolemmal, sarcomeric, and citosolic muscle proteins. Deficiencies or loss of function of these proteins leads to variable degree of progressive loss of motor ability. Several animal models, manifesting phenotypes observed in neuromuscular diseases, have been identified in nature or generated in laboratory. These models generally present physiological alterations observed in human patients and can be used as important tools for genetic, clinic, and histopathological studies. The mdx mouse is the most widely used animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although it is a good genetic and biochemical model, presenting total deficiency of the protein dystrophin in the muscle, this mouse is not useful for clinical trials because of its very mild phenotype. The canine golden retriever MD model represents a more clinically similar model of DMD due to its larger size and significant muscle weakness. Autosomal recessive limb-girdle MD forms models include the SJL/J mice, which develop a spontaneous myopathy resulting from a mutation in the Dysferlin gene, being a model for LGMD2B. For the human sarcoglycanopahties (SG), the BIO14.6 hamster is the spontaneous animal model for delta-SG deficiency, whereas some canine models with deficiency of SG proteins have also been identified. More recently, using the homologous recombination technique in embryonic stem cell, several mouse models have been developed with null mutations in each one of the four SG genes. All sarcoglycan-null animals display a progressive muscular dystrophy of variable severity and share the property of a significant secondary reduction in the expression of the other members of the sarcoglycan subcomplex and other components of the Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Mouse models for congenital MD include the dy/dy (dystrophia-muscularis) mouse and the allelic mutant dy(2J)/dy(2J) mouse, both presenting significant reduction of alpha2-laminin in the muscle and a severe phenotype. The myodystrophy mouse (Large(myd)) harbors a mutation in the glycosyltransferase Large, which leads to altered glycosylation of alpha-DG, and also a severe phenotype. Other informative models for muscle proteins include the knockout mouse for myostatin, which demonstrated that this protein is a negative regulator of muscle growth. Additionally, the stress syndrome in pigs, caused by mutations in the porcine RYR1 gene, helped to localize the gene causing malignant hypertermia and Central Core myopathy in humans. The study of animal models for genetic diseases, in spite of the existence of differences in some phenotypes, can provide important clues to the understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders and are also very valuable for testing strategies for therapeutic approaches.",,,,2008-01-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
18160687,Local dystrophin restoration with antisense oligonucleotide PRO051.,,The New England journal of medicine,"Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is associated with severe, progressive muscle weakness and typically leads to death between the ages of 20 and 35 years. By inducing specific exon skipping during messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing, antisense compounds were recently shown to correct the open reading frame of the DMD gene and thus to restore dystrophin expression in vitro and in animal models in vivo. We explored the safety, adverse-event profile, and local dystrophin-restoring effect of a single, intramuscular dose of an antisense oligonucleotide, PRO051, in patients with this disease.
Four patients, who were selected on the basis of their mutational status, muscle condition, and positive exon-skipping response to PRO051 in vitro, received a dose of 0.8 mg of PRO051 injected into the tibialis anterior muscle. A biopsy was performed 28 days later. Safety measures, composition of mRNA, and dystrophin expression were assessed.
PRO051 injection was not associated with clinically apparent adverse events. Each patient showed specific skipping of exon 51 and sarcolemmal dystrophin in 64 to 97% of myofibers. The amount of dystrophin in total protein extracts ranged from 3 to 12% of that found in the control specimen and from 17 to 35% of that of the control specimen in the quantitative ratio of dystrophin to laminin alpha2.

American journal of roentgenology,"Clinical trials involving patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are hindered by the lack of suitable objective end points. The purpose of this study was to examine whether muscle lipid infiltration measured with the three-point Dixon MRI technique has value as a marker of disease severity.
Disease severity in nine boys (mean age, 8.6 +/- 2.7 years) with Duchenne muscular dystrophy was determined with the functional ability scale of Brooke and associates. Functional scores were compared with strength measurements obtained by manual testing of muscles of the lower extremities, knee extensor strength measured with an isokinetic dynamometer, and muscle fat percentage in the quadriceps and hamstrings determined with the three-point Dixon MRI technique.
MRI measurements of fat infiltration had stronger correlation (p < 0.05) with functional grade than did measurements obtained with manual muscle testing (p = 0.07) or quantitative strength measured with the isokinetic dynamometer (p = 0.54). Muscle fat percentage did not correlate with strength measurements from manual or dynamometer muscle testing but increased with age in subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

17981565,Clinical approaches in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using oligonucleotides.,,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,"Duchenne Muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most severe forms of hereditary diseases in muscles. The identification and characterization of dystrophin, the gene responsible for the disease has lead to the development of potential gene therapy treatments for this disorder. The complex structure and size of the dystrophin gene represent a challenge for some gene therapy approaches such as gene replacement mediated by viral vectors. Others, including oligonucleotide-mediated gene therapies have allowed forms of manipulation in the dystrophin gene not possible with other disorders. The use of oligonucleotides to modulate gene expression has shown to be a feasible alternative treatment to DMD. Antisense-mediated technologies have made outstanding progress in the last decade and two phase I clinical trials for exon skipping in DMD are already in progress. Gene correction mediated by oligonucleotides faces much greater obstacles, but the outcome of the approach, permanent correction of the gene defect, represents an ideal treatment to the disease. Gene therapy mediated by antisense oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide mediated gene editing have the potential to have a primary role in gene therapy applications to muscles, but they are still far from representing an effective cure. Factors like safety and sustained beneficial effects in patients will have to be considered in detail before this technology can become applicable to the treatment of muscles disorders. Ultimately the need for production of oligonucleotides in large scale and the cost of treatment for each individual patient will play a big role in the feasibility of these approaches in DMD.",,,,2007-11-06,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
17942817,Albuterol increases lean body mass in ambulatory boys with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy.,,Neurology,"Albuterol is a beta-2 agonist that has been demonstrated to increase muscle strength in studies in animals and humans. Based on a pilot study of extended-release albuterol Repetabs in children with dystrophinopathies, the authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a crossover design.
Fourteen boys with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy, 6 to 11 years old, completed two treatment periods (albuterol and placebo), 12 weeks each, separated by a 12-week washout period. As the albuterol Repetab formulation was no longer available, an alternate extended release albuterol was used (Volmax, 12 mg per day). Outcome measurements included 1) lean body mass, 2) fat mass, 3) isometric knee extensor and flexor moments, 4) manual muscle testing, and 5) timed functional tests.
Lean body mass was significantly higher for subjects following albuterol treatment compared to placebo treatment, while fat mass was significantly lower. No differences were found in isometric knee moments or manual muscle tests. Time to run/walk 30 feet was improved following albuterol.
Short-term treatment with extended release albuterol may increase lean body mass, decrease fat mass, and improve functional measures in patients with dystrophinopathies. However, the significant change in strength of specific muscle groups found in the pilot study was not observed in the present study. These findings may be attributed to differences in the drug release and kinetics between Repetab and Volmax formulations as they affect the concentration of available beta-2 receptors on the muscle cell surface differently.",,"Lean body mass was significantly higher for subjects following albuterol treatment compared to placebo treatment, while fat mass was significantly lower.

There is no cure for DMD and current treatment options focus primarily on respiratory assistance, comfort care, and delaying the loss of ambulation. Recent works support the idea that stem cells can contribute to muscle repair as well as to replenishment of the satellite cell pool. Here we tested the safety of autologous transplantation of muscle-derived CD133+ cells in eight boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in a 7-month, double-blind phase I clinical trial. Stem cell safety was tested by measuring muscle strength and evaluating muscle structures with MRI and histological analysis.

We have completed a study that directly deals with the following key issues that can be directly adapted to a gene therapy clinical trial using rAAV considering the following criteria: 1) A regional vascular delivery approach that will protect the patient from widespread dissemination of virus; 2) an approach to potentially facilitate safe passage of the virus for efficient skeletal muscle transduction; 3) the use of viral doses to accommodate current limitations imposed by vector production methods; 4) and at the same time, achieve a clinically meaningful outcome by transducing multiple muscles in the lower limb to prolong ambulation.
The capacity of AAV1, AAV6 or AAV8 to cross the vascular endothelial barrier carrying a micro-dystrophin cDNA was compared under identical conditions with delivery through a catheter placed in the femoral artery of the mdx mouse. Transduction efficiency was assessed by immuno-staining using an antibody (Manex1a) that recognizes the N-terminus of micro-dystrophin. The degree of physiologic correction was assessed by measuring tetanic force and protection from eccentric contraction in the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL). The vascular delivery paradigm found successful in the mouse was carried to the non-human primate to test its potential translation to boys with DMD.
Regional vascular delivery resulted in transduction by rAAV8.micro-dystrophin reaching 94.5 +/- 0.9 (1 month), 91.3 +/- 3.1 (2 months), and 89.6 +/- 1.6% (3 months). rAAV6.micro-dystrophin treated animals demonstrated 87.7 +/- 6.8 (1 month), 78.9 +/- 7.4 (2 months), and 81.2 +/- 6.2% (3 months) transduction.

17885779,Safety and efficacy of carvedilol therapy for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to muscular dystrophy.,,Pediatric cardiology,"By the age of 20 years, almost all patients with Duchenne's or Becker's muscular dystrophy have experienced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition that contributes significantly to their morbidity and mortality. Although studies have shown carvedilol to be an effective therapy for patients with other forms of DCM, few data exist concerning its safety and efficacy for patients with muscular dystrophy. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carvedilol for patients with DCM.
A clinical trial at an outpatient clinic investigated 22 muscular dystrophy patients, ages 14 to 46 years, with DCM and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50%. Carvedilol up-titrated over 8 weeks then was administered at the maximum or highest tolerated dose for 6 months. Baseline and posttreatment cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), echocardiography, and Holter monitoring were recorded.
Carvedilol therapy was associated with a modest but statistically significant improvement in CMR-derived ejection fraction (41% +/- 8.3% to 43% +/- 8%; p < 0.02). Carvedilol also was associated with significant improvements in both the mean rate of pressure rise (dP/dt) during isovolumetric contraction (804 +/- 216 to 951 +/- 282 mmHg/s; p < 0.05) and the myocardial performance index (0.55 +/- 0.18 to 0.42 +/- 0.15; p < 0.01). A trend toward improved shortening fraction, E/E' ratio, and isovolumetric relaxation time also was observed. Two patients had runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia exceeding 140 beats per minute (bpm) before carvedilol administration.

We examined the possibility of moving forward with gene therapy, an approach that demonstrates promise for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gene therapy is not limited to replacement of defective genes but also includes strategies using surrogate genes with alternative but effective means of improving cellular function or repairing gene mutations. The first viral-mediated gene transfer for any muscle disease was carried out at Columbus Children's Research Institute and Ohio State University for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D, and the first viral-mediated trial of gene transfer for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is under way at the same institutions. These studies, consisting of intramuscular injection of virus into a single muscle, are limited in scope and represent phase 1 clinical trials with safety as the primary end point. These initial clinical studies lay the foundation for future studies, providing important information about dosing, immunogenicity, and viral serotype in humans.

17767400,Comparative analysis of antisense oligonucleotide sequences for targeted skipping of exon 51 during dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing in human muscle.,,Human gene therapy,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the absence of functional protein. In the majority of cases these are out-of-frame deletions that disrupt the reading frame. Several attempts have been made to restore the dystrophin mRNA reading frame by modulation of pre-mRNA splicing with antisense oligonucleotides (AOs), demonstrating success in cultured cells, muscle explants, and animal models. We are preparing for a phase I/IIa clinical trial aimed at assessing the safety and effect of locally administered AOs designed to inhibit inclusion of exon 51 into the mature mRNA by the splicing machinery, a process known as exon skipping. Here, we describe a series of systematic experiments to validate the sequence and chemistry of the exon 51 AO reagent selected to go forward into the clinical trial planned in the United Kingdom. Eight specific AO sequences targeting exon 51 were tested in two different chemical forms and in three different preclinical models: cultured human muscle cells and explants (wild type and DMD), and local in vivo administration in transgenic mice harboring the entire human DMD locus. Data have been validated independently in the different model systems used, and the studies describe a rational collaborative path for the preclinical selection of AOs for evaluation in future clinical trials.",,,,2007-09-05,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Although preliminary data support the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on left ventricular (LV) function, our aim was to examine the long-term impact of a preventive treatment with perindopril on mortality in children with DMD.
Patients with DMD between the ages of 9.5 and 13 years presenting with normal LV ejection fraction were included in this prospective study. They were randomly assigned for 3 years to perindopril, 2 to 4 mg (group 1), or placebo (group 2) in a double-blind protocol, followed by open-label treatment with perindopril for up to 10 years. Survival rate at 10 years in each group is reported.
There were 28 patients assigned to group 1 and 29 to group 2. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. At the end of the 10 years' follow-up period, survival status was available for all included patients: 26 (92.9%) of 28 patients in group 1 were alive at 10 years versus 19 (65.5%) of 29 in group 2 (P = .02).

Without mechanical ventilation (MV), morbidity and mortality are highly likely towards the end of the second decade of life. The present review reports evidence and clinical implications regarding DMD patients treated with MV. There is no doubt that nocturnal hypercapnia precedes daytime hypercapnia. Historical comparisons have provided evidence that non-invasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) at night is effective and improves quality of life and survival by 5-10 years. By contrast, the optimal criteria and timing for initiation of NIPPV are inconsistent. A recent randomized study however demonstrated the benefits of commencing NIPPV as soon as nocturnal hypoventilation is detected (Ward S, et al., Randomised controlled trial of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for nocturnal hypoventilation in neuromuscular and chest wall disease patients with daytime normocapnia. Thorax 2005; 60: 1019-24). The respective role of the three hypotheses of the indirect action of nocturnal NIPPV on daytime blood gases may be complimentary; the main improvement may be due to improved ventilatory response to CO2. The ultimate time to offer full time ventilation with the most advantageous interface is lacking in evidence. Full time NIV is possible with a combination of a nasal mask during the night and a mouthpiece during the day, however tracheostomy may be provided when mechanical techniques of cough-assistance are useless to treat chronic cough insufficiency.",,,,2007-08-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
17620231,[Mechanical ventilation in chronic ventilatory insufficiency].,,"Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)","Mechanical ventilation has become an important treatment option in chronic ventilatory failure. There are different diseases which lead to ventilatory failure and to home mechanical ventilation (HMV). A primary loss of in- and expiratory muscle strength is the reason for respiratory deterioration in neuromuscular disease. In most of these diseases ventilatory failure develops because of the progressive character of muscular damage. Initially, ventilatory failure can be found during night-time. In the case of hypercapnia at daytime, life expectancy is strongly reduced, especially in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. HMV leads to a prolongation of life and to an increase in quality of life, if bulbar involvement is not severe. Impressive clinical improvements under HMV have been found in restrictive disorders of the rib cage like kyphoscoliosis or posttuberculosis sequelae, with an increase of quality of life, walking distance and a decrease in pulmonary hypertension. Only few data are published about long-term results of HMV in Obesity Hypoventilation. In terms of retrospective analyses of clinical data HMV seems to improve survival in this population. Some patients only need CPAP treatment, but most patients have to be treated with ventilatory support. The application of HMV in patients with chronic ventilatory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is growing, but there are controversial results in randomised clinical trials. Analysis of these data suggest better results of HMV in patients with severe hypercapnia, with the application of higher effective ventilatory pressure and a ventilator mode with a significant reduction in the work of breathing. Under such conditions HMV leads to a reduction of hypercapnia, an improvement in sleep quality, walking distance and quality of life, but until now there is no evidence in reduction of mortality in COPD.",,,,2007-07-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Myocardial strain imaging by tissue Doppler echocardiography is a new method for assessing regional myocardial function. We hypothesized that this method might be useful for the early detection of subclinical myocardial involvement in DMD patients.
Myocardial radial strain of the left ventricle was measured in 25 DMD patients (age: 14.8 +/- 3.1 years) with a normal left ventricular shortening fraction and 25 age-matched healthy controls.
Peak systolic radial strain of the posterior wall in a short-axis view of the left ventricle was significantly lower in DMD patients compared to control subjects (P < 0.0001). In the interventricular septum, peak systolic radial strain was not significantly different between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis differentiated DMD patients from control patients with 92% sensitivity and 92% specificity, when the cutoff value for systolic peak strain of the posterior wall was 61%. When radial strain was measured separately for the inner and outer halves of the posterior wall, a systolic negative strain was more frequently observed in the outer half than in the inner half of the posterior wall (6/25 vs. 0/25, P < 0.05).

17555369,Potential of oligonucleotide-mediated exon-skipping therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Expert opinion on biological therapy,"Many of the mutations associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy can potentially be rescued by exon-skipping therapy, targeting selected exons of prespliced mRNA for the dystrophin gene with antisense oligonucleotides, thereby restoring reading frames. The recent development of antisense oligonucleotides with higher stability and lower toxicity, such as morpholinos, has made it possible to restore dystrophin efficiently in dystrophic mice in vivo with no obvious side effects. There seems little doubt that such exon-skipping therapy is destined to proceed to the clinical application stage in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One of the remaining issues to be addressed is the skipping of multiple exons because such multi-exon skipping therapy could expand the potential patient target population to include 80% of those with duplication mutations and 90% of those with deletion mutations. At present, this multi-exon skipping strategy is being investigated in dystrophic dogs as well as dystrophic mice. There are several challenges that still need to be overcome, including the low uptake of antisense oligonucleotides into the heart and the need to design efficient, nontoxic, cost-effective oligonucleotides.

In children who are still able to walk as well as in those who are wheelchair-bound, corticosteroids have been found to stabilize muscle strength for a period of time. Controlled clinical observations have shown that some boys remain ambulatory for years longer than reported in natural history data. The two main steroids used are prednisone/prednisolone and deflazacort. They are probably equally effective in stabilizing muscle strength but may have different side-effect profiles; for instance, deflazacort causes less weight gain. The exact mechanism by which steroids slow the dystrophic process is under investigation. DMD children treated long term also seem to develop other complications of the condition less frequently. For instance, they develop respiratory insufficiency later and have fewer cardiac symptoms. The therapeutic value of corticosteroids is limited, but these drugs represent the best treatment option currently available.",,,,2007-06-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The aim of this study was to identify quantitative indices that would help characterize the dystrophic dog non-invasively using NMR imaging. Two-month-old dystrophic dogs and healthy control animals were scanned at 4T. Standard T2- and T1-weighted images, fat-saturated T1-weighted images pre- and post-gadolinium chelate injection were acquired and kinetics of muscle enhancement were studied over a 2-h period.

Our previous findings supported the idea that dystrophin and associated proteins, absent or greatly reduced in DMD, are degraded in dystrophin-deficient muscle by the proteasomal-dependent pathway. Indeed, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 of skeletal muscles from mdx mice--a spontaneous mouse model of DMD--as well as from DMD patients, effectively rescued the expression and correct cellular localization of dystrophin and associated proteins. These promising results led us to further explore the use of proteasome inhibitors as a therapy for DMD. Therefore, we directed our attention towards two new dipeptide boronic acid inhibitors blocking the proteasomal-dependent degradation pathway: Velcade (bortezomib or PS-341) and MLN273 (PS-273). The exciting aspect of this development is that these drugs have already progressed to preclinical and clinical trials, in different fields than muscular dystrophy. Indeed, Velcade has been already FDA-approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and its side effects had been already explored and managed. Promisingly, MLN273 is currently in the preclinical trial phase. Here, we test the effectiveness of Velcade and MLN273 by local injection into the gastrocnemius muscle of mdx mice. We show the rescue of expression and membrane localization of alpha-dystroglycan, beta-dystroglycan, alpha-sarcoglycan, and dystrophin after Velcade and MLN273 localized treatment, versus untreated (PBS only) mdx mice. Intriguingly, we also show that localized treatment with Velcade and MLN273 reduces the activation of Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NFkB). Because the NFkB pathway has been shown to be involved in inflammation responses in myopathies and DMD, our current results may have important clinical implications. Clearly, more investigations are needed, but our results emphasize the effectiveness of the pharmacological approach as a potential treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",,,,2007-05-15,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Additional approaches to myostatin inhibition have been shown to have beneficial effects in vivo. Blockade of myostatin activity with the myostatin prodomain resulted in increases in muscle mass, enhanced muscle function, and histological improvement of the dystrophic muscle in mdx mice and mutant caveolin-3 transgenic mice (a model of LGMD1C). Treatment with an extracellular ligand-binding domain of the myostatin receptor, ActRIIB, resulted in prominent muscle mass increases in LGMD1C model mice.

We have previously demonstrated that direct intramuscular injection of AAV2 or AAV6 in wild-type random-bred dogs resulted in a robust immune response to capsid or capsid-associated proteins. We now demonstrate that a brief course of immunosuppression with a combination of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine (CSP), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is sufficient to permit long-term and robust expression of a canine micro-dystrophin (c-micro-dys) transgene in the skeletal muscle of a dog model for DMD (canine X-linked muscular dystrophy, or cxmd dog) and that its expression restored localization of components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex at the muscle membrane.

Myocardial markers such as MB type of creatine kinase (CK-MB), heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) and cardiac troponins are expected to evaluate active myocardial degeneration. However, their availabilities in these patients have not been examined yet.
Participants were 129 patients with dystrophinopathies; 100 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 25 Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and 4 DMD/BMD carriers.

TA range and age at loss of standing with KAFOs were prospectively assessed in nine DMD patients who underwent serial casting prior to rehabilitation into KAFOs and compared to a group of 20 DMD patients who had TA (group II) or TA and iliotibial band (ITB) surgical resection (group III). TA range after casting was reduced at least to plantargrade/neutral in 8 of the 9 patients studied although patients who had surgery had better correction of TA angles.

The results of this pilot study suggest that serial casting of the TAs can be considered in DMD patients with moderate TA contractures and in whom there are no significant iliotibial band (ITB) tightness, although this intervention is probably not as effective as surgery in maintaining long-term TA range. This procedure may therefore be considered both in patients with medical contraindication to surgery, and also in patients or families who are not prepared to cope with the stress and discomfort of TA surgery.",,,,2007-02-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Prevention of limb deformities, rehabilitation in knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs) and glucocorticoids prolong walking and standing, and might reduce scoliosis. We evaluated possible predictive factors for scoliosis development in a large DMD population.
Case notes of 123 DMD boys, > or = 17 years, followed at our centre between 1992 and 2002 were reviewed. Univariate analysis was used to relate two outcome measures (age at onset of scoliosis and severity at 17 years) with (i) glucocorticoids treatment; (ii) ages at (a) loss of independent ambulation, (b) rehabilitation into KAFOs, (c) loss of standing, (iii) forced vital capacity (FVC) (%) between 11 and 12 years and (iv) lower limb contractures.
In total, 37/123 boys (30%) received intermittent prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day, 10 day/month) for a median 1-year (2 months-9 years), starting between 7.7 and 12.4 years (mean 9.5). About 96/123 (78%) were rehabilitated into KAFOs at 10.2+/-1.6 years. Age at loss of ambulation in KAFOs was 12.3+/-1.9 years and at loss of standing 12.8+/-2.1 years. About 95/123 (77%) boys developed scoliosis (Cobb angle >30 degrees ). Mean age+/-S.D. at scoliosis onset was 12.7+/-1.6 years. Forty-three boys (35%) had scoliosis surgery by 15+/-1.2 years. Later age at loss of ambulation (p<0.0001) and longer duration of prednisolone treatment (p=0.01) related to later scoliosis onset.

Our data indicate a significant association between prolonged ambulation and a reduced risk of scoliosis development. Glucocorticoid administration, in our series, appear to be associated with a later onset of scoliosis, but did not alter the severity at 17 years, probably reflecting the shorter overall glucocorticoid exposure in this population.",,"In total, 37/123 boys (30%) received intermittent prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day, 10 day/month) for a median 1-year (2 months-9 years), starting between 7.7 and 12.4 years (mean 9.5). About 96/123 (78%) were rehabilitated into KAFOs at 10.2+/-1.6 years. Age at loss of ambulation in KAFOs was 12.3+/-1.9 years and at loss of standing 12.8+/-2.1 years.

17253553,Surgery for scoliosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Scoliosis in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy is usually progressive and treated with surgery. However, it is unclear whether the existing evidence is sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support a recommendation for spinal surgery for most people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and scoliosis.
The objectives of this systematic review were to determine the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients with scoliosis. We intended to test whether spinal surgery is effective in increasing life expectancy, improving respiratory function, improving quality of life and overall functioning; and whether spinal surgery is associated with severe adverse effects.
We searched the specialized registers of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group and Cochrane Back Group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2006), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to Jan 2006), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2006), and the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database (January 2006). No language restrictions were imposed.
Controlled clinical trials using random or quasi-random allocation of treatment evaluating all forms of spinal surgery for scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were to be included in the review. The control interventions would have been no treatment, non-operative treatment, or a different form of spinal surgery.
Two authors examined the search results and evaluated the study characteristics against inclusion criteria to decide which ones would be included in the review.
A total of 402 studies were identified from electronic searching. Thirty-six studies were relevant but none met the inclusion criteria for the review, because they were not clinical trials but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series.
Since there were no randomized controlled clinical trials available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, no evidence-based recommendation can be made for clinical practice. Patients should be informed about the uncertainty of benefits and potential risks of surgery for scoliosis. Randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery, in terms of patients' quality of life, functional status, respiratory function and life expectancy.",,,,2007-01-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
17222213,The effects of glucocorticoid therapy on the inflammatory and dendritic cells in muscular dystrophies.,,International journal of experimental pathology,"Various clinical trials have documented the therapeutic benefit of glucocorticoids (GCs) in enhancing muscle strength and slowing disease progression of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD). We hypothesized that GCs may have relevance to the differential anti-inflammatory effect on mononuclear inflammatory cells (MICs) and Dendritic cells (DCs) infiltrating the dystrophic muscles. In this prospective study, two muscle biopsies were obtained (before and after 6-month prednisone therapy) from 30 patients with dystrophies (DMD = 18; BMD = 6; and limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) = 6). MICs and DCs infiltrating the muscles were examined using mouse monoclonal antibodies and immunoperoxidase staining methods. Muscle strength was evaluated monthly by manual testing, motor ability and timed tests. Prednisone therapy was associated with: (i) functional improvement of overall motor disability, in upper limbs of DMD (P < 0.001) and BMD (P < 0.01) and lower limbs of DMD (P < 0.001) and BMD (P < 0.05); (ii) histological improvement such as fibre size variation (DMD, P < 0.01; BMD, P < 0.05), internalization of nuclei (DMD, P < 0.05), degeneration and necrosis (DMD and BMD, P < 0.01), regeneration (DMD, P < 0.001; BMD, P < 0.01) and endomysial connective tissue proliferation (DMD, P < 0.01; BMD, P < 0.05) and (iii) reduction of total MICs (P < 0.01) and DCs (P < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between the degree of improvement in overall motor disability and reduction of DCs numbers (In upper limbs; r = 0.638, P < 0.01 for DMD and r = 0.725, P < 0.01 for BMD, in Lower limbs; r = 0.547, P < 0.05 for DMD and r = 0.576, P < 0.05 for BMD). Such improvements and changes of MICs/DCs were absent in LGMD. In DMD/BMD, prednisone therapeutic effect was associated with reduced MICs and DCs numbers.

Saline was injected in the contralateral gastrocnemius. The patient was immunosuppressed with tacrolimus. The protocol of cell transplantation was well tolerated and did not cause permanent sequels. Some injected sites were biopsied at 1, 14 and 18 months post-transplantation. Muscles were replaced by fat and fibrosis. In the cell-grafted site of the gastrocnemius, 27.5% of the myofiber profiles expressed donor-derived dystrophin 1 month post-transplantation and 34.5% 18 months post-transplantation. The contralateral gastrocnemius was dystrophin-negative. Myofibers were virtually absent in the biceps brachii, where only two dystrophin-positive myofibers were observed. In conclusion, a ""high-density injection"" protocol was feasible for intramuscular cell-transplantation in a DMD patient and long-term expression of donor-derived dystrophin was observed.",,,,2006-12-05,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A decade of experimental work has revealed many properties of myoblasts, including the stability of resulting hybrid myofibers without immune suppression, the persistence of transgene expression, and the lack of tumorigenicity. Early phase clinical trials also showed that myoblast-based therapy is a promising approach for many intractable clinical conditions, including both muscle-related and non-muscle-related diseases. The potential application of myoblast therapy may be in the treatment of genetic muscle diseases, cardiomyocyte damaged heart diseases, and urinary incontinence. This review will provide an overview of myoblast biology, along with discussion of the potential application in clinical medicine.

17096300,Drug evaluation: PTC-124--a potential treatment of cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,"PTC-124, a 1,2,4-oxadiazole compound, is in development by PTC Therapeutics Inc as an orally active small molecule that can override nonsense stop translation signals to produce full-length proteins. PTC-124 is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials against cystic fibrosis (CF) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The functional properties of PTC-124 are similar to the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin, but the two compounds are chemically distinct and PTC-124 does not exhibit any antibiotic characteristics. In vitro experiments showed PTC-124 to be superior to gentamicin at ribosomal read-through of nonsense mutations. In vivo investigations revealed that PTC-124 was effective in restoring the production of full-length protein in animal models of CF and DMD. Phase I clinical trials reported that PTC-124 was well tolerated in healthy patients. The author concludes that the encouraging results observed to date make PTC-124 an attractive option for further well-designed, long-term human studies on larger sample populations. The author also predicts that if results continue to be positive, PTC-124 could also be trialed in other single gene disorders with nonsense mutations such as hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, retinitis pigmentosa, bullous skin diseases and lysosomal storage disorders.",,,,2006-11-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
17076269,Redirecting splicing to address dystrophin mutations: molecular by-pass surgery.,,Progress in molecular and subcellular biology,"Mutations in the dystrophin gene that prevent synthesis of a functional protein lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common serious childhood muscular dystrophy. The major isoform is produced in skeletal muscle and the size of the dystrophin gene and complexity of expression have posed great challenges to the development of a therapy for DMD. Considerable progress has been made in the areas of gene and cell replacement, yet it appears that any potential therapy for DMD is still some years away. Other approaches are being considered, and one that has generated substantial interest over the last few years is induced exon skipping. Antisense oligonucleotides have been used to block abnormal splice sites and force pre-mRNA processing back to the normal patterns. This approach is re-interpreted to address the more common dystrophin mutations, where normal splice sites are targeted to induce abnormal splicing, resulting in specific exon exclusion. Selected exon removal during processing of the dystrophin pre-mRNA can by-pass nonsense mutations or restore a disrupted reading frame arising from genomic deletions or duplications. Attributes of the dystrophin gene that have hampered gene replacement therapy may be regarded as positive features for induced exon skipping, which may be regarded as a form of by-pass surgery at the molecular level. In humans, antisense oligonucleotides have been more generally applied to down-regulate specific gene expression, for the treatment of acquired conditions such as malignancies and viral infections. From interesting in vitro experiments several years ago, the dystrophin exon-skipping field has progressed to the stage of planning for clinical trials.",,,,2006-11-02,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The endpoints included quantitative muscle tests (QMTs), timed function tests, forced vital capacity (FVC), and manual muscle tests (MMT). Thirty-one ambulatory subjects with DMD (mean age 8.9 years; range 5-16 years) were evaluated at eight sites by 15 newly trained evaluators as a test of interrater reliability of outcome measures. Both total QMT score [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.96] and individual QMT assessments (ICC 0.85-0.96) were highly reliable. Forced vital capacity and all timed function tests were also highly reliable (ICC 0.97-0.99). MMT was the least reliable assessment method (ICC 0.61). These data suggest that primary surrogate outcome measures in large multicenter clinical trials in DMD should use QMT, FVC, or time function tests to obtain maximum power and greatest sensitivity.",,,,2006-09-14,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
16874449,Therapeutic restoration of dystrophin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Journal of muscle research and cell motility,"It is 20 years since the discovery of the genetic defect causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This X-linked progressive and fatal myopathy is due to the absence of a functional version of a critical sub-sarcolemmal protein called dystrophin that appears to act both as a structural and as a signalling molecule in the muscle fibre. A number of molecular approaches have been developed to restore the expression of dystrophin in DMD patients. Pre-clinical experiments have demonstrated the potential of delivery of recombinant versions of the DMD gene using viral or non-viral vectors and importantly several of these systems are compatible with vascular delivery, an essential feature as all muscles are affected in this condition. Other studies have shown that antisense oligonucleotides can modify the splicing of the primary transcript to provide an internally truncated but still functional protein. Alternatively, in approximately 10-20% of cases it is possible to chemically persuade the translational machinery to read-through a pre-mature stop codon. The pre-clinical results of the last 4 years have encouraged the development of clinical trials for all of the above.",,,,2006-07-29,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In total, 42 DMD patients aged 15-33 yrs, normocapnic at night with NIPPV and receiving MIPPV since end-diurnal hypercapnia, were studied. Transcutaneous CO2 tension (Pt,CO2) was prospectively monitored at the end of the day, before and after MIPPV initiation. Vital capacity (VC), breathing pattern and maximal inspiratory strength were measured. Patients were asked to score the presence (1 point) or absence (0 point) of seven respiratory-linked symptoms before and after MIPPV establishment. Survival rates reached 88, 77, 58 and 51% after 1, 3, 5 and 7 yrs, respectively. The mean survival rate was 31 yrs. VC stabilised during 5 yrs with MIPPV. Symptom scores significantly decreased and Pt,CO2 normalised during the day (8.17 +/- 2.22 to 5.78 +/- 0.73 kPa). No accident and minor side-effects were observed in this 184 cumulated patient-yrs study. In conclusion, daytime mouthpiece ventilation is safe, prolongs survival and stabilises vital capacity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.

16864930,Beta-blocker therapy for cardiac dysfunction in patients with muscular dystrophy.,,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,"In muscular dystrophy, cardiac function deteriorates with time and heart failure is one of the major causes of death. Although the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and beta-blockers improves cardiac function in adults, little is known about the efficacy of those drugs in patients with muscular dystrophy.
The effect of the beta-blocker, carvedilol, and/or ACEI on ventricular function in patients with muscular dystrophy was studied. Carvedilol and an ACEI were given to 13 patients (ACEI group; mean age 18 years, range 7-27 years), and an ACEI only to 15 patients (carvedilol group; mean age 15 years, range 8-29 years). Diagnoses included Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n=25), Fukuyama muscular dystrophy (n=2), and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (n=1). Echocardiographic parameters of the left ventricle were measured during the 2-3 years of follow-up. In the carvedilol group, combination therapy of carvedilol and an ACEI for 2 years resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS). In the ACEI group, there was no significant change in LVFS. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased in the ACEI group, but not in the carvedilol group.

Out of the 67 DMD patients enrolled in this study, 44 were put on prednisolone therapy and 23 served as controls. All patients were followed-up at two-monthly intervals for two years and thereafter they continued to take their respective medications till their chair-bound stage; then the drug was gradually withdrawn. In the treatment group 24 patients could not continue the trial because of adverse effects - 14 due to excessive obesity, 3 due to measles, 4 due to pulmonary tuberculosis, 2 due to recurrent throat and chest infection and 1 due to an unexplained high leukocyte count. Of the remaining 20 patients in the treatment group, steroid therapy was stopped in 5 patients as there was no improvement in power in six months. Fifteen patients in the treatment group and 19 patients in the control group could be followed regularly for 2 years and then up to chair-bound stage. Outcome parameters included fall frequency, peak expiratory flow rate, limb muscle power, ability to lift weights, time taken in getting up from squatting position, walking 9 metres and climbing 13 stairs. Maximum improvement was noted between 2 and 4 months while mild improvement in some parameters continued up to six months. All parameters remained stabilised for 1 year or so, after which there was slight deterioration. Deterioration at 2 years was, however, less than the natural course of events noted in control patients. Prednisolone treated patients and controls became chair bound at the mean age of 169 +/- 9 and 132 +/- 8 months respectively. Till the ideal stage of the disease and the type or dosage of starting steroid therapy is defined by specially designed studies, 0.75 mg/Kg/day prednisolone therapy may be started in DMD patients at the stage of frequent falls ( > 10 / day) on walking or increased get-up time ( > 10 s) as observed while testing Gowers' sign; this improves muscle power and timing of motor performance within 2-4 months of onset of therapy in about 75% of those who tolerate this therapy, with a possible gain of approximately 3 years in terms of independent walking.",,,,2006-06-21,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
16724091,Antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping restores dystrophin expression in vitro in a canine model of DMD.,,Gene therapy,"Manipulation of pre-mRNA splicing by antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) offers considerable potential for a number of genetic disorders. One of these is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), where mutations in the dystrophin gene typically result in premature termination of translation that causes a loss of functional protein. AOs can induce exon skipping such that the mutation is by-passed and the reading frame restored, producing an internally deleted protein similar to that found in the milder Becker muscular dystrophy. To date, this approach has been applied to the mdx mouse model in vitro and in vivo and in human myoblast cultures. Here, we report the application of AO-directed exon skipping to induce dystrophin expression in vitro in a canine model of DMD, golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD). The efficacy of 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (2OMe), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) and peptide-linked PMOs (PMO-Pep) to induce dystrophin expression was assessed. The 2OMe chemistry was only effective for short-term induction of corrected transcript and could not induce detectable dystrophin protein. The PMO chemistry generally induced limited exon skipping at only high concentrations; however, a low level of dystrophin protein was produced in treated cells. Use of the PMO-Pep, applied here for the first time to a DMD model, was able to induce high and sustained levels of exon skipping and induced the highest level of dystrophin expression with no apparent adverse effects upon the cells. The induction of dystrophin in the GRMD model offers the potential for further testing of AO delivery regimens in a larger animal model of DMD, in preparation for application in human clinical trials.",,,,2006-05-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Cultured MPCs obtained from one of the patient's parents were implanted in 0.25 or 1 cm of a Tibialis anterior in 9 patients with DMD. MPC injections were placed 1 to 2 mm from each other, and a similar pattern of saline injections was done in the contralateral muscle. The patients were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus. Muscle biopsies were performed at the injected sites 4 weeks later. In the biopsies of the cell-grafted sites, there were myofibers expressing donor's dystrophin in 8 patients. The percentage of myofibers expressing donor's dystrophin varied from 3.5% to 26%. Evidence of small myofiber neoformation was observed in some patients. Donor-derived dystrophin transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the cell-grafted sites in all patients. The protocol of immunosuppression was sufficient to obtain these results, although it is not certain whether acute rejection was efficiently controlled in all the cases. In conclusion, intramuscular allotransplantation of normal MPCs can induce the expression of donor-derived dystrophin in skeletal muscles of patients with DMD, although this expression is restricted to the sites of MPC injection.",,,,2006-05-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Histological studies of many neuromuscular diseases indicated that loss of motor-nerve and/or skeletal-muscle function might be due to excessive cell death by apoptosis. Recent studies have confirmed this possibility by showing that pathology in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, congenital muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy and collagen-VI deficiency, but not Duchenne muscular dystrophy, is significantly ameliorated by genetic or pharmacological interventions that have been designed to inhibit apoptosis.

Muscles from dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mice, a well-characterized animal model for DMD, were injected with antisense constructs that restore the open reading frame in the Dmd gene. Synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) complexed with different carriers to enhance cellular uptake and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-expressed antisense sequences were evaluated. Muscular gene expression profiles were analyzed on oligonucleotide microarrays.
Polyethylenimine (PEI)-complexed AONs restored the reading frame slightly more effectively than uncomplexed, F127- or Optison-complexed AONs. However, PEI induced the expression of many immune genes, reflecting an aggravation of the inflammation present in untreated mdx mice. Expression profiles in Optison and F127-injected muscles were similar to those of saline treated muscles, implying that these carriers did not evoke adverse responses. Due to moderate levels of exon skipping, a significant shift toward wild-type expression levels was not detected. Injection with rAAV vectors resulted in much higher production of dystrophin and greatly improved the histological appearance of the muscle. Depending on the efficacy of the treatment, the expression of genes previously shown to be elevated in muscular dystrophies, partly or completely returned to wild-type expression levels. Reductions in inflammation and fibrosis were among the most prominent changes observed.
Expression profiling is a powerful tool for the evaluation of both desired and adverse effects of new pharmacological therapies. It is sensitive and detects changes that are not histologically visible. In addition, its ability to simultaneously monitor a large number of different biological processes not only reduces the number of different assays required in preclinical research and clinical trials, but may also assist in the early detection of potential side effects.",,"Polyethylenimine (PEI)-complexed AONs restored the reading frame slightly more effectively than uncomplexed, F127- or Optison-complexed AONs.

To improve nutritional support in DMD, we tested whether oral supplementation with glutamine for 10 d decreased whole-body protein degradation significantly more than did an isonitrogenous amino acid control mixture.
Twenty-six boys with DMD were included in this randomized, double-blind parallel study; they received an oral supplement of either glutamine (0.5 g . kg(-1) . d(-1)) or an isonitrogenous, nonspecific amino acid mixture (0.8 g . kg(-1) . d(-1)) for 10 d.

16550930,Myoblast transfer therapy: is there any light at the end of the tunnel?,,Acta myologica : myopathies and cardiomyopathies : official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology,"Myoblast transfer therapy (MTT) was proposed in the 70's as a potential treatment for muscular dystrophies, based upon the early results obtained in mdx mice: dystrophin expression was restored in this model by intramuscular injections of normal myoblasts. These results were quickly followed by clinical trials for patients suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in the early 90's, based mainly upon intramuscular injections of allogenic myoblasts. The clinical benefits obtained from these trials were minimal, if any, and research programs concentrated then on the various pitfalls that hampered these clinical trials, leading to numerous failures. Several causes for these failures were identified in mouse models, including a massive cell death of myoblasts following their injection, adverse events involving the immune system and requiring immunosuppression and the adverse events linked to it, as well as a poor dispersion of the injected cells following their injection. It should be noted that these studies were conducted in mouse models, not taking into account the fundamental differences between mice and men. One of these differences concerns the regulation of proliferation, which is strictly limited by proliferative senescence in humans. Although this list is certainly not exhaustive, new therapeutic venues were then explored, such as the use of stem cells with myogenic potential, which have been described in various populations, including bone marrow, circulating blood or muscle itself. These stem cells presented the main advantage to be available and not exhausted by the numerous cycles of degeneration/regeneration which characterize muscle dystrophies. However, the different stem candidates have shown their limits in terms of efficiency to participate to the regeneration of the host. Another issue was raised by clinical trials involving the injection of autologous myoblasts in infacted hearts, which showed that limited targets could be aimed with autologous myoblasts, as long as enough spared muscle was available. This resulted in a clinical trial for the pharyngeal muscles of patients suffering from Oculo-Pharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). The results of this trial will not be available before 2 years, and a similar procedure is being studied for Fascio-Scapulo-Humeral muscular Dystrophy (FSHD). Concerning muscular dystrophies which leave very few muscles spared, such as DMD, other solutions must be found, which could include exon-skipping for the eligible patients, or even cell therapy using stem cells if some cell candidates with enough efficiency can be found. Recent results concerning mesoangioblasts or circulating AC133+ cells raise some reasonable hope, but still need further confirmations, since we have learned from the past to be cautious concerning a transfer of results from mice to humans.",,,,2006-03-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
16550929,Myoblast transplantation: clinical trials and perspectives. Mini-review.,,Acta myologica : myopathies and cardiomyopathies : official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology,"Myoblast transplantation (MT) is proposed to challenge the repair of striated muscles in various pathological conditions. Indeed, myoblasts are of easy procurement and expansion from small muscle biopsies. They are naturally able to participate to skeletal muscle regeneration through cell-cell fusion, leading to the formation of new or hybrid muscle fibers. In an autologous context, MT relies on the localized increased muscle generative capacity brought by large number of myoblasts : cells may be transferred from a clinically unaffected area to the disabled territory. In an heterologous context, MT further allows to transfer a non-pathologic, donor genome into the disabled recipient muscle fibers. Autologous approaches are then developed as localized repairs are mandated, while heterologous approaches are used in the context of generalized, advanced degenerative diseases. Whatever the immunological situation, however, MT is hampered by several issues, mainly the poor survival and the limited migratory ability of the myoblasts. Some solutions are emerging, which recently allowed the set-up of new clinical trials in dedicated indications.",,,,2006-03-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Individuals with nocturnal hypercapnia but daytime normocapnia were randomised to a control group or nocturnal NIV to examine whether nocturnal hypoventilation is a valid indication for NIV.
Forty eight patients with congenital neuromuscular or chest wall disease aged 7-51 years and vital capacity<50% predicted underwent overnight respiratory monitoring. Twenty six with daytime normocapnia and nocturnal hypercapnia were randomised to either nocturnal NIV or to a control group without ventilatory support. NIV was started in the control group if patients fulfilled preset safety criteria.
Peak nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (Tcco2) did not differ between the groups, but the mean (SD) percentage of the night during which Tcco2 was >6.5 kPa decreased in the NIV group (-57.7 (26.1)%) but not in controls (-11.75 (46.1)%; p=0.049, 95% CI -91.5 to -0.35).

16145697,Spirometry is affected by intelligence and behavior in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Pediatric pulmonology,"Children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have progressive respiratory muscle weakness. Spirometry monitors progress, but is effort-dependent. Intelligence quotients (IQ) average one standard deviation below normal, and behavioral disturbance is common. Our aim was to assess if impaired intelligence or behavior influences spirometry in children with DMD, and if computerized visual incentives (CVI) are beneficial. Forty-seven boys with DMD, of mean age 12.6 years (range, 6-19), were recruited. Full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ, and parent-and-teacher-reported oppositional behavior scores, were recorded. Each was divided into moderate, mild, and no impairment groups. A randomized crossover design was applied to performing spirometry with or without CVI first. A Jaeger Masterscope (version 4.60) was used. Linear regression defined the relationship between spirometry and both IQ and behavior scores. The paired Student's t- test compared spirometry performed with and without CVI for the overall group and subgroups. Boys with DMD can adequately perform spirometry. There is an association between %FEV1 and %FVC with full-scale (r = 0.50, P = 0.002; r = 0.49, P = 0.003, respectively), performance (r = 0.68, P < 0.0005; r = 0.68, P < 0.0005, respectively) and verbal (r = 0.39, P = 0.043; r = 0.36, P = 0.037, respectively) IQ, but not with parent (P = 0.77, P = 0.70, respectively) or teacher (P = 0.90, P = 0.90, respectively)-reported oppositional behavior scores. The effect of CVI was significant in those with moderate full-scale (P = 0.03), performance (P = 0.002), and verbal (P = 0.02) intellectual impairment, and moderately severe teacher-reported oppositional behavior (P = 0.02).

16114261,[About a phase I gene therapy clinical trial with a full-length dystrophin gene-plasmid in Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy].,,Journal de la Societe de biologie,"This is the first gene transfer trial in Duchenne/Becker patients. The aim of the study was to provide evidence on transgene expression and safety of the intramuscular administration of a plasmid containing a full-length dystrophin CDNA. Nine Duchenne/Becker patients, distributed in three cohorts of three patients, were injected into their radialis muscles either once with 200 microg (first cohort) or 600 microg (second cohort) or twice, two weeks apart, with 600 microg plasmidic DNA (third cohort). The patients were enrolled sequentially upon evaluation of the data by an independant pilot committee. In the biopsies taken three weeks after the initial injection from the injected site, the plasmid was detected in all patients. An exogenous dystrophin expression was found in 6/9 patients. The level of expression was low, up to 6 % of weak complete sarcolemmal labelling, and up to 26% of partial sarcolemmal staining. Dystrophin in RNAs were detected by nested RT-PCR in five out of the six biopsies with exogenous dystrophin-positive fibers. Interestingly, neither humoral or cellular antidystrophin responses were observed. No local or general adverse effects were seen.

16096005,The mechanism of naked DNA uptake and expression.,,Advances in genetics,"The administration of naked nucleic acids into animals is increasingly being used as a research tool to elucidate mechanisms of gene expression and the role of genes and their cognate proteins in the pathogenesis of disease in animal models (Herweijer and Wolff, 2003; Hodges and Scheule, 2003). It is also being used in several human clinical trials for genetic vaccines, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, peripheral limb ischemia, and cardiac ischemia (Davis et al., 1996; Romero et al., 2002; Tsurumi et al., 1997). Naked DNA is an attractive non-viral vector because of its inherent simplicity and because it can easily be produced in bacteria and manipulated using standard recombinant DNA techniques. It shows very little dissemination and transfection at distant sites following delivery and can be readministered multiple times into mammals (including primates) without inducing an antibody response against itself (i.e., no anti-DNA antibodies generated) (Jiao et al., 1992). Also, contrary to common belief, long-term foreign gene expression from naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) is possible even without chromosome integration if the target cell is postmitotic (as in muscle) or slowly mitotic (as in hepatocytes) and if an immune reaction against the foreign protein is not generated (Herweijer et al., 2001; Miao et al., 2000; Wolff et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 2004). With the advent of intravascular and electroporation techniques, its major restriction--poor expression levels--is no longer limiting and levels of foreign gene expression in vivo are approaching what can be achieved with viral vectors. Direct in vivo gene transfer with naked DNA was first demonstrated when efficient transfection of myofibers was observed following injection of mRNA or pDNA into skeletal muscle (Wolff et al., 1990). It was an unanticipated finding in that the use of naked nucleic acids was the control for experiments designed to assess the ability of cationic lipids to mediate expression in vivo. Subsequent studies also found foreign gene expression after direct injection in other tissues such as heart, thyroid, skin, and liver (Acsadi et al., 1991; Hengge et al., 1996; Kitsis and Leinwand, 1992; Li et al., 1997; Sikes and O'Malley 1994; Yang and Huang, 1996). However, the efficiency of gene transfer into skeletal muscle and these other tissues by direct injection is relatively low and variable, especially in larger animals such as nonhuman primates (Jiao et al., 1992). After our laboratory had developed novel transfection complexes of pDNA and amphipathic compounds and proteins, we sought to deliver them to hepatocytes in vivo via an intravascular route into the portal vein. Our control for these experiments was naked pDNA and we were once again surprised that this control group had the highest expression levels (Budker et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1997). High levels of expression were achieved by the rapid injection of naked pDNA in relatively large volumes via the portal vein, the hepatic vein, and the bile duct in mice and rats. The procedure also proved effective in larger animals such as dogs and nonhuman primates (Eastman et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1997). The next major advance was the demonstration that high levels of expression could also be achieved in hepatocytes in mice by the rapid injection of naked DNA in large volumes simply into the tail vein (Liu et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999). This hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) procedure is proving to be a very useful research tool not only for gene expression studies, but also more recently for the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Lewis et al., 2002; McCaffrey et al., 2002). The intravascular delivery of naked pDNA to muscle cells is also attractive particularly since many muscle groups would have to be targeted for intrinsic muscle disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. High levels of gene expression were first achieved by the rapid injection of naked DNA in large volumes via an artery route with both blood inflow and outflow blocked surgically (Budker et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2001). Intravenous routes have also been shown to be effective (Hagstrom et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2001). For limb muscles, the ability to use a peripheral limb vein for injection and a proximal, external tourniquet to block blood flow renders the procedure to be clinically viable. This review concerns itself with the mechanism by which naked DNA is taken up by cells in vivo. A greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in the uptake and expression of naked DNA, and thus connections between postulated mechanisms and expression levels, is emphasized. Inquiries into the mechanism not only aid these practical efforts, but are also interesting on their own account with relevance to viral transduction and cellular processes. The delivery to hepatocytes is first discussed given the greater information available for this process, and then uptake by myofibers is discussed.",,,,2005-08-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
16085461,Splicing intervention for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Current opinion in pharmacology,"The manipulation of pre-mRNA to alter gene transcript splicing patterns offers considerable potential for many genetic disorders. In particular, the targeted removal of one or more exons from a gene transcript can skip over, or compensate for, disease-causing mutations. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy, is one such disorder that could benefit from this strategy. Splicing modulation can convert a DMD phenotype into the less severe allelic Becker-like phenotype. Recent studies using antisense oligonucleotide-targeted exon skipping to induce near normal dystrophin in vivo in animal models, and in vitro in DMD cell lines, highlight the promise of this approach. On the basis of these successes, human clinical trials could be realized in the near future.",,,,2005-08-09,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
16084084,Terminal antisense oligonucleotide modifications can enhance induced exon skipping.,,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,"Induction of specific exon skipping during the processing of the dystrophin gene transcript is being pursued as a potential therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Antisense oligonucleotides directed at motifs involved in pre-mRNA processing can manipulate dystrophin exon incorporation in the mature gene transcript. We have compared the exon skipping ability of oligodeoxyribonucleotides with compounds of the identical sequence incorporating 2'-O-methyl modified bases. Antisense oligonucleotides composed entirely of 2'-O-methyl modified bases on a phosphorothioate backbone were consistently more efficient at inducing exon skipping than comparable oligodeoxyribonucleotides. Chimeric antisense oligonucleotides, mixtures of unmodified and 2'-O-methyl modified bases, induced intermediate levels of exon skipping. In addition, we describe terminal modifications that may be incorporated into the 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotides to further enhance efficiency of exon skipping. Our findings suggest that 2'-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotides should be considered for human clinical trials involving targeted exon skipping in dystrophin gene expression in preference to oligodeoxyribonucleotides.",,,,2005-08-09,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

A retrospective analysis of intra-and postoperative (up to 36 h) estimated blood losses was performed in 156 patients undergoing spinal surgery for: DMD (n = 31), idiopathic scoliosis (IS) (n = 70), poliomyelitis (n = 10), cerebral palsy (CP) (n = 28), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (n = 17). Platelet aggregation and bleeding times were also investigated in DMD patients. Immunohistochemistry for dystrophin was performed in platelets, megakaryocytes and blood vessels of normal tissues. DMD patients showed significantly higher intraoperative estimated blood losses (DMD: 3495+/-890 ml; IS: 2269+/-804 ml; poliomyelitis: 2582+/-1252 ml; CP: 2071+/-683 ml; SMA: 2464+/-806 ml; P < 0.05), while postoperative blood losses were similar among different groups. Higher estimated blood losses in DMD were independent of the duration of surgery, body weight, gender, age, vertebral levels or preoperative Cobb angle. DMD children had significantly prolonged bleeding times, but retained normal platelet function. From control samples dystrophin was expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, but not in platelets. DMD appears to be characterized by immediate bleeding during highly-invasive surgery and increased bleeding time without platelet abnormalities. Considering dystrophin expression in normal vascular smooth muscle cells, these results altogether suggest a selective defect of primary hemostasis in DMD, likely to be due to impaired vessel reactivity.",,,,2005-07-13,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Detection of left ventricular dysfunction in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) has relied on 2-dimensional imaging yet often these images are suboptimal. This study was undertaken to determine if DTV and the myocardial performance index (MPI) could provide additional diagnostic information in DMD. We determined in 31 patients and 13 age-matched control subjects the prevalence of both abnormal DTV of the mitral annulus and abnormal MPI. Mean values for early diastolic DTV were significantly lower for patients compared with control subjects (P < .001) and were abnormally low in 86% of patients. The MPI was abnormal in 79% of patients. All but one patient with DMD had either abnormal DTV or abnormal MPI yet 19% had normal fractional shortening.

15922766,Human muscle hardness assessment during incremental isometric contraction using transient elastography.,,Journal of biomechanics,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between biceps brachii hardness using the transient elastography technique, and its activity level by quantifying the surface electromyographic signal (sEMG). Ten healthy subjects volunteered for this protocol. To assess the maximal biceps brachii myoelectric activity (sEMG-RMSm), subjects had to achieve their maximal voluntary contraction trial during an elbow flexion effort. They were then asked to perform an isometric biceps sEMG-RMS ramp trial in elbow flexion from 0% to 50% of their sEMG-RMSm in 120 s. A low-frequency pulse was sent every 5 s during all trials by an innovative shear elasticity probe previously placed over the belly of the biceps brachii allowing the calculation of a transverse shear modulus. The main results of this study were (i) the finding of a systematic linear relationship between the biceps brachii transverse shear moduli and the corresponding sEMG-RMS values. This was not the case when plotting transverse shear modulus versus the elbow flexion torque production. Therefore, the computation of a hardness index from the slope of individual transverse shear modulus-sEMG-RMS linear relationship was enabled; (ii) It was also found that the higher is the rest shear modulus, the lower is the hardness index, indicating that the transverse shear modulus change during contraction depends on its level at rest. Therefore, this non-invasive technique could be useful in the medical field to explore deep muscles which are unreachable by classical testing methods. It could also be applied for the follow-up of neuromuscular diseases inducing stiffness changes such as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",,,,2005-06-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

15851877,Onset and duration of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Anesthesiology,"In patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) the response to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is scarcely documented and conflicting. The current study was conducted to determine the time to peak effect and the time for complete spontaneous recovery after a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium in patients with DMD.
Twenty-four patients (12 with DMD, 12 controls, aged 10-16 yr) were studied. All patients were anesthetized with propofol and fentanyl/remifentanil. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored by acceleromyography. After induction all patients received a single dose of 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium. The complete time course of onset and spontaneous recovery were recorded
Significant (P < 0.01) increase in the onset times to 95% neuromuscular block was observed in DMD patients (median, 203 s; range, 90-420 s) compared with controls (median, 90 s; range, 60-195 s). The time between rocuronium administration and recovery of first twitch of the train-of-four to 90% was significantly (P < 0.01) prolonged in DMD compared with controls (median, 132 min; range, 61-209 min versus 39 min; 22-55 min). The recovery index was also significantly prolonged in the DMD group compared with controls (median, 28 min, range, 15-70 min versus 8 min; 3-14 min).
The most striking and surprising result of this study is the delayed onset of blockade in DMD after a standard dose of rocuronium.

Part A,"Mutations in the DMD gene result in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Readily available clinical tests detect only deletions of one exon or greater, which are found in approximately 60% of cases. Mutational analysis of other types of DMD mutations, such as premature stop codons and small frameshifting insertions or deletions, has historically been hampered by the large size of the gene. We have recently reported a method that allows the rapid and economical sequencing of the entire coding region of the DMD gene, and that is more sensitive than methods based on single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) screening or other preliminary screening steps. Here we use single condition amplification/internal primer (SCAIP) sequencing analysis, in combination with multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) analysis of duplications, to report the frequency of mutations in a large cohort of unselected dystrophinopathy patients from a single clinic. Our results indicate that 7% of dystrophinopathy patients do not have coding region mutations, suggesting that intronic mutations are not uncommon. The availability of rapid and thorough mutation analysis from peripheral blood samples, along with an improved estimate of the percentage of non-coding region mutations, will be of benefit for improved genetic counseling and in identification of cohorts for clinical trials.",,,,2005-02-22,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy between the ages of 8 and 15 years and who had four or more years of deflazacort treatment were reviewed. Diagnostic criteria included males with proximal muscle weakness evident before 5 years, increased serum creatine kinase and genetic testing and/or a muscle biopsy consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Thirty-seven boys were treated with protocol-N using deflazacort at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg per day for the first 20 days of the month and no deflazacort for the remainder of the month. Boys with osteoporosis received daily vitamin D and calcium. Deflazacort treatment started between 4 and 8 years of age. Thirty-two were treated with protocol-T using deflazacort at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg per day, plus daily vitamin D and calcium. Treatment started between 6 and 8 years of age. All boys were monitored every 4-6 months. The results were compared with age-matched controls in the two groups (19 for protocol-N and 30 for protocol-T). For the boys treated with protocol-N, 97% were ambulatory at 9 years (control, 22%), 35% at 12 years (control, 0%), 25% at 15 years (control, 0%). For the 32 boys treated with protocol-T, 100% were ambulatory at 9 years (control, 48%), 83% at 12 years (control, 0%) and 77% at 15 years (control, 0%). No aids or leg braces were used for ambulation. In boys 13 years and older, a scoliosis of >20 degrees developed in 30% of the boys on protocol-N, 16% on protocol-T and 90% of controls. For protocol-N, no cataracts were observed while in protocol-T, 30% of boys had asymptomatic cataracts that required no treatment. Fractures occurred in 19% (control 16%) of boys on protocol-N and 16% (control, 20%) of boys on protocol-T. This report illustrates: (a) the importance of collaborative studies in developing treatment protocols in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and (b) the long-term beneficial effects of deflazacort treatment in both protocols.

The mean ages were 6.8 +/- 2.1 years (range 2.5-12.5) and 7.0 +/- 1.3 years (range 5.0-9.0), respectively. We assessed muscle strength, 10-m walking, ankle contracture, and loss of independent walking ability age and onset of scoliosis. Treatment regimen was oral prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg on alternate days, plus vitamin D 600-1200 units/day and a calcium-enriched diet. After a follow-up period of 2.75 +/- 1.1 years (range 1.5-5) and when compared with controls, there was a statistically significant change in muscle strength between the two groups after 12 months (P < 0.05).

One potential therapy for DMD involves transplantation of myoblasts from normal individuals. Unfortunately, myoblast allografts are particularly immunogenic and transplant tolerance in dystrophic (mdx/mdx) mice has not yet been achieved despite using strategies successful in other allograft models. Here, we attempted to induce 'central tolerance' using either haplo- or fully allogeneic bone marrow after conditioning with low-dose (3 Gy) whole body irradiation and anti-CD154 or anti-CD45RB mAbs. With one exception, these mice lacked persistent chimerism, long-term survival of myoblast allografts, or tolerance. In contrast, the addition of anti-CD45RB to anti-CD154 uniformly resulted in long-lived high-level mixed chimerism, long-term (>100 days) engraftment of allogeneic myoblasts and deletion of donor-reactive cells. Moreover, all recipients exhibited tolerance to second myoblast allografts or donor-specific tolerance to skin transplants performed >80 days after the initial graft. Thus, we now report that anti-CD45RB synergizes with anti-CD40L to promote stable mixed chimerism and robust tolerance to myoblast allografts for the first time. This novel protocol may be applicable to future clinical trials in myoblast transplantation for treatment of DMD and for transplantation of other immunogenic allografts.",,,,2004-07-23,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

To date, the relationship between clinical stage, prognosis and myocardial damage has not been evaluated by radionuclear cardiac imaging. The main goal of this study was to elucidate the relationship of quantitative indices of myocardial damage obtained by radionuclear cardiac imaging ([201Tl] and [123I] BMIPP) to clinical stage and incidence of severe cardiac events in patients with Duchenne-type muscular dystrophy (DMD).
The study population consisted of 28 male patients with DMD. The average age at the beginning of observation was 19.1 +/- 7.4 yrs. Nuclear tomographic imaging was performed using [201Tl] and [123I] BMIPP. The mid-ventricular short axial slices were classified into four anatomical regions, and the normalized count data in these areas (TL, BM) were obtained. The endpoint was the occurrence of heart failure during the follow up period.
Thirteen cases of heart failure occurred during the 5-year follow-up period, including three cases with cardiac death due to congestive heart failure.

This incurable disease is characterised by muscle wasting and loss of walking ability leading to complete wheelchair dependence by 13 years of age. Prolongation of walking is one of the major aims of treatment.
The aim of this review was to assess whether glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize or improve muscle strength and walking in boys with DMD.
We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialised register (October 2003) using the term 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'. We also searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2003), CINAHL and LILACS (January 1982 to October 2003). We wrote to authors of published studies and other experts in this disease to help identify other trials, checked the references in the identified trials and handsearched the abstracts of relevant journals.
Types of studies: randomised or quasi-randomised trials.
all patients with a definite diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Types of interventions: glucocorticoids such as prednisone, prednisolone, deflazacort or others, with a minimum treatment period of three months.
prolongation of walking (independent walking without long leg calipers).
strength outcome measures, manual muscle strength testing using Medical Research Council strength scores, functional outcome measures and adverse events.
We identified five randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria for our review. Two reviewers independently selected the trials for the review and assessed methodological quality. Data extraction and inputting were double-checked.
data from one small study used prolongation of walking as an outcome measure and did not show significant benefit.
The meta-analysis of the results from three randomised controlled trials showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function over six months. Improvements were seen in time taken to rise from the floor (Gowers' time), nine metres walking time, four-stair climbing time, ability to lift weights, leg function grade and forced vital capacity. One randomised controlled trial showed that glucocorticoid corticosteroids stabilize muscle strength and function for up to two years. The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day. Not enough data were available to compare efficacy of prednisone with deflazacort.Adverse effects: Excessive weight gain, behavioural abnormalities, cushingoid appearance and excessive hair growth were all more common with glucocorticoid corticosteroids than placebo. Long-term adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy could not be evaluated because of the short-term duration of the randomised studies.Non-randomised studies: a number of non-randomised studies with important efficacy and adverse effects data are tabulated and discussed.
There is evidence from randomised controlled studies that glucocorticoid corticosteroid therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy improves muscle strength and function in the short-term (six months to two years). The most effective prednisolone regime appears to be 0.75 mg/kg/day. In the short term, adverse effects were significantly more common but not clinically severe. Long-term benefits and hazards of glucocorticoid treatment cannot be evaluated from the currently published randomised studies. Non-randomised studies support the conclusions of functional benefits but also indicate clinically significant adverse effects of long-term treatment.

One such agent is the anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) oxandrolone, which has been used in such clinical situations as HIV-related muscle wasting, severe burn injury, trauma following major surgery, neuromuscular disorders and alcoholic hepatitis for over 30 years. In the US, oxandrolone is the only AAS that is US FDA-approved for restitution of weight loss after severe trauma, major surgery or infections, malnutrition due to alcoholic cirrhosis, and Duchenne's or Becker's muscular dystrophy. Our review of the use of oxandrolone in the treatment of catabolic disorders, HIV and AIDS-related wasting, neuromuscular and other disorders provides strong evidence of its clinical efficacy. Improvements in body composition, muscle strength and function, status of underlying disease or recovery from acute catabolic injury and nutritional status are significant in the vast majority of well designed trials. However, oxandrolone has not yet been studied in sarcopenia.Unlike other orally administered C17alpha-alkylated AASs, the novel chemical configuration of oxandrolone confers a resistance to liver metabolism as well as marked anabolic activity. In addition, oxandrolone appears not to exhibit the serious hepatotoxic effects (jaundice, cholestatic hepatitis, peliosis hepatis, hyperplasias and neoplasms) attributed to the C17alpha-alkylated AASs. Oxandrolone is reported to be generally well tolerated and the most commonly documented adverse effects are transient elevations in transaminase levels and reductions in high density lipoprotein cholesterol level.However, optimal risk:benefit ratios for oxandrolone and other agents in its class will need to be refined before widespread clinical acceptance of AASs as a therapeutic option in sarcopenia and other chronic wasting conditions.",,,,2004-03-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

American volume,"Scoliosis due to progressive muscle weakness occurs in almost all males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and it progresses relentlessly. Previous studies have shown that corticosteroid treatment slows the decline in muscle strength and stabilizes muscle strength in patients with this disease. We hypothesized that steroids may also attenuate the development of scoliosis. The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of scoliosis in male patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who received steroids with a control group of such patients who did not.
A group of seven to ten-year-old boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were able to walk were enrolled in a nonrandomized comparative study to determine the effect of deflazacort (a derivative of prednisone) on muscle strength and pulmonary function. Thirty patients were treated with deflazacort (treatment group), and twenty-four were not (control group). The patients were matched for age and pulmonary function at baseline. To assess the development of scoliosis, the patients in each group were followed for at least five years. Survival curves were plotted to determine the chance of scoliosis of >/=="" BORDER=""0"">20 degrees developing. The difference between the groups with respect to the chance of scoliosis developing was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis.
A curve of >/=="" BORDER=""0"">20 degrees developed during the follow-up period in sixteen (67%) of the twenty-four patients in the control group but in only five (17%) of the thirty patients in the treatment group. Fifteen of the twenty-four patients in the control group underwent spine surgery, at a mean age of thirteen years, whereas only five of the thirty patients in the treatment group underwent spine surgery, at a mean age of fifteen years. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant difference between the two groups with regard to development of scoliosis of >/=="" BORDER=""0"">20 degrees (p < 0.001). Cataracts developed in ten patients in the treatment group, and stress fractures developed in three patients in the treatment group. Patients in the treatment group weighed a mean of 3.7 kg more than did those in the control group.
Steroid treatment slows the progression of scoliosis in males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, longer-term evaluation will be necessary to determine if the treatment prevents the development of scoliosis or just delays its onset. At the very least, steroid treatment delays the need for spinal surgery.

However, the discovery of the DMD gene about 20 years ago has allowed a change in the focus of therapeutic strategy dramatically toward delivery of the missing gene/protein. Indeed, some degree of success has been achieved in preclinical animal studies using such strategies, and gene therapy trials are currently underway in humans.

One sequence consisted of (1) assisted mucus clearance technique (AMCT, which involves forced expiratory technique and manual assisted cough), (2) endotracheal suctioning, (3) nebulizer administration of 5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for 5 min, (4) a second AMCT session, (5) endotracheal suctioning, (6) 45 min after the end of the nebulizer treatment a third AMCT session, (7) endotracheal suctioning. The other treatment sequence was the same except that it included IPV during the 5-min nebulizer treatment. The collected secretions were weighed. Vital capacity was measured once, before the treatments. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, airway resistance, and peak expiratory flow were measured before and at 45 min after the treatments. Mean values were compared using analysis of variance with repeated measures.
In patients with hypersecretion the mean +/- SD weight of the collected secretions was significantly higher with IPV (6.53 +/- 4.77 g vs 4.57 +/- 3.50 g, p = 0.01). Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxyhemoglobin saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, airway resistance, and peak expiratory flow did not differ statistically between the 2 treatments.

12966700,Gentamicin administration in Duchenne patients with premature stop codon. Preliminary results.,,Acta myologica : myopathies and cardiomyopathies : official journal of the Mediterranean Society of Myology,"Aim of the study was to investigate whether the administration of gentamicin could restore dystrophin expression in striated muscles of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy caused by premature stop codon, as reported in mdx mice. Four Duchenne patients, still ambulant or in wheelchair stage for less than 4 months, selected among those with point mutations resulting in premature stop codons, received two 6-day cycles of gentamicin sulfate, at an interval of 7 weeks, according to the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second University of Naples. A muscle biopsy was performed after the second cycle of administration; the specimens were analysed by both immuno-histochemistry and Western blotting. Skeletal muscle changes were monitored by dynamic tests and Creatine Kinase values; at the beginning and end of treatment, cardiac and respiratory status was evaluated by electrocardiography, echocardiography, acoustic densitometry and vital capacity. Side-effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were also monitored. Three out of four patients, who had the most permissive UGA as stop codon, showed positive results. In one patient, there was a dramatic re-expression of dystrophin by both immuno-histochemistry and Western blot; in two patients, dystrophin positive fibres were seen by the antibody to the rod domain with immuno-histochemistry; the fourth patient, with UAA as stop codon, showed no expression of dystrophin at all. These results suggest that gentamicin is able to recover dystrophin expression in a subset of Duchenne patients with nonsense mutations, raising the possibility of the first pharmacological treatment for muscular dystrophy.",,,,2003-09-12,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, Dissertation Abstracts, Health Star, PsychINFO and Cochrane, were searched using the following inclusion criteria: 1) A randomized controlled trial comparing DFZ with placebo or another therapy; 2) Male participants age 2-18 years with DD; 3) Outcomes of (a) any form of strength or functional testing, or (b) any form of side effect.
Fifteen studies of potential relevance were identified, with five meeting the inclusion criteria. These five studies included 291 children and were published in English language journals between 1994 and 2000. Two studies compared DFZ versus placebo, two studies compared DFZ with prednisone and one study had both placebo and prednisone comparisions. Two large trials were identified that have not been published in article format.

12750741,Pharmacological strategies for muscular dystrophy.,,Nature reviews. Drug discovery,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal, genetic disorder whose relentless progression underscores the urgency for developing a cure. Although Duchenne initiated clinical trials roughly 150 years ago, therapies for DMD remain supportive rather than curative. A paradigm shift towards developing rational therapeutic strategies occurred with identification of the DMD gene. Gene- and cell-based therapies designed to replace the missing gene and/or dystrophin protein have achieved varying degrees of success. However, pharmacological strategies not designed to replace dystrophin per se appear promising, and can circumvent many hurdles hampering gene- and cell-based therapy. Here, we will review present pharmacological strategies, in particular those dealing with functional substitution of dystrophin by utrophin and enhancing muscle progenitor commitment by myostatin blockade, with a view toward facilitating drug discovery for DMD.",,,,2003-05-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

After placebo, no change was observed in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and resistance to fatigue, whereas total joint stiffness (TJS) was increased by approximately 25% (P < 0.05). The patients receiving Cr did not show any change in TJS, improved MVC by 15% (P = 0.02), and almost doubled their resistance to fatigue (P < 0.001). In patients still independent of a wheelchair (n = 5), bone mineral density increased by 3% (P < 0.05), and urinary excretion of collagen type I cross-linking N-telopeptide declined to about one third (P < 0.001) after Cr.

12657225,A preliminary randomized study of growth hormone administration in Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophies.,,European heart journal,"Since growth hormone (GH) has proven beneficial in experimental heart failure, and the natural history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is frequently complicated by the development of dilated cardiomyopathy, we administered GH to six patients with DMD and 10 with BMD, with the evidence of cardiac involvement.
Patients were randomized to receive for 3 months either placebo or recombinant human GH, in a double-blind fashion. In GH-treated patients, left ventricular (LV) mass increased by 16% in BMD and by 29% in DMD (both p<0.01), with a significant increase of relative wall thickness (+19%). Systemic blood pressure remained unchanged, while LV end-systolic stress fell significantly by 13% in BMD and by 33% in DMD, with a slight increase of systolic function indexes. No changes were observed related to cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle function in the patient groups during the treatment period, nor any side effects were observed. Brain natriuretic peptide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha circulating levels were elevated at baseline. While brain natriuretic peptide decreased by 40%, cytokine levels did not exhibit significant variations during the treatment period.
The 3-month GH therapy in patients with DMD and BMD induces a hypertrophic response associated with a significant reduction of brain natriuretic peptide plasma levels and a slight improvement of systolic function, no changes in skeletal muscle function, and no side effects.",,,,2003-03-27,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Muscle function was evaluated by timed tests, and muscle strength with a hand-held myometer. After 55 months of treatment, the five patients (mean age 8.3 years) in the prednisone group were still able to get up from the floor, whereas two of the three in the control group had lost this ability. Side effects included a decline in growth rate in the prednisone-treated patients and excessive weight gain in one control and three treated patients. Because steroids are effective in prolonging function, but not in recovering lost function, we propose that treatment be started with low-dose prednisone in DMD patients as soon as the diagnosis is definite.",,,,2003-01-28,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
12467746,High dose weekly oral prednisone improves strength in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,"Daily prednisone improves strength in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but side effects are almost universal. We used a different dosing regimen of prednisone to determine if benefit to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy might be maintained with fewer side effects. Twice weekly oral prednisone was given each Friday and Saturday (5mg/kg/dose). This total dose is twice as high as the daily low dosage prednisone regimen (0.75 mg/kg/day). Twenty boys (8.0+/-1.2 years) were treated. Historical control groups included 18 untreated boys (6.1+/-1.6 years) and four boys (7.3+/-0.6 years) treated with daily prednisone. Strength (using a hand-held manometer and grip meter) and timed functional testing were measured. There was an improvement in upper extremity strength for 95% of boys (n=20) at 6 months using quantitative strength testing. Improvement in lower extremity strength occurred in all boys with antigravity quadriceps strength (17/17). The improvement (P=0.001 for proximal upper extremities; P=0.002 for grip; and P<0.0001 for proximal lower extremities) was significant compared to untreated boys. Sixteen boys were treated continuously for more than 12 months (22+/-1.5 months). Of these, 15 remained significantly stronger than prior to treatment and 8/16 showed additional gains in strength after six months of treatment. Six boys were on the weekly prednisolone 2 years or longer without interruption. All six had upper and lower extremity strength at follow-up that was as good or better than at baseline. Functional testing improved in boys less than 8 years without contractures. Three boys without antigravity quadriceps strength at the start of treatment lost the ability to walk unassisted within 6 months. Eight other boys lost the ability to ambulate unassisted between 12 and 24 months of treatment. In each, progressive contractures developed. Linear growth was maintained in all boys on weekly treatment. Obesity rates did not differ from untreated boys. Twice weekly prednisone improved strength over 6-12 months in the majority of boys, but did not slow contracture development. Sustained benefit beyond 12 months is possible with fewer side effects compared to daily prednisone.",,,,2002-12-07,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
12362416,Altered regional brain glucose metabolism in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a pet study.,,Muscle & nerve,"The basis for cognitive impairment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is not well understood but may be related to abnormal expression of dystrophin in brain. The aim of this study was to determine whether regional brain glucose metabolism is altered in children with DMD and whether such metabolic disturbances are localized to regions shown to be normally rich in dystrophin expression. Ten boys (mean age, 11.8 years) with DMD and 17 normal adults as a control group (mean age, 27.6 years) underwent 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) and neuropsychological evaluation. The PET data were analyzed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The SPM analysis showed five clusters of decreased glucose metabolism in children with DMD, including the medial temporal structures and cerebellum bilaterally and the sensorimotor and lateral temporal cortex on the right side. At the voxel level, significant glucose hypometabolism was found in the right postcentral and middle temporal gyri, uncus, and VIIIB cerebellar lobule, as well as in the left hippocampal gyrus and cerebellar lobule. The neuropsychological profile of the DMD group revealed borderline nonverbal intellectual functioning, impaired manual dexterity bilaterally, borderline cognitive functioning, and internalizing behavioral difficulties. Our findings demonstrate region-specific hypometabolism, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in DMD children. As the regions showing hypometabolism on PET include those normally rich in dystrophin expression, it will be important to determine whether the hypometabolic regions also show cytoarchitectural abnormalities related to the lack of dystrophin.",,,,2002-10-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
12221405,Pulsed Doppler tissue imaging in dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy.,,Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography,"Cardiac dysfunction is a primary feature in patients and female carriers of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Conventional echocardiography and pulsed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) were performed in 28 patients with BMD, in 20 female carriers, and in 38 control participants (20 men and 18 women). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was lower in BMD patients (P <.02) and carriers (P <.02) than in normal participants. Two subgroups of BMD patients were identified: A1 = LVEF > or = 55% (n = 20) and A2 = LVEF < 55% (n = 8). The carriers displayed LVEF > or = 55%. Compared with control participants the diastolic alterations by conventional echocardiography were lower early filling peak in the subgroup A1 (P <.05) and prolonged isovolumic relaxation time in A1, A2, and in carriers (at least P <.02). Furthermore, pulsed DTI showed lower early diastolic wave peak at basal septum in A2 (P <.05) and in carriers (P <.0001); at lateral mitral annulus and at basal inferior wall in A1, A2, and in carriers (at least P <.05); lower early/late diastolic wave ratio at basal septum and lateral mitral annulus (P <.05) in carriers; and prolonged isovolumic relaxation time in A1, A2, and in carriers (at least P <.02), except at lateral mitral annulus of carriers. Systolic parameters investigated by pulsed DTI detected lower peak systolic wave at basal septum in A1, A2, and carriers (P <.02); at lateral mitral annulus in carriers (P <.02); at basal inferior wall in A1, A2 (P <.02), and in carriers (P <.0001); and lower time-velocity integral of S wave at each segment in A1, A2, and in carriers. In dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy, pulsed DTI may be a useful technique to assess diastolic dysfunction and appears to be a promising tool in identifying early regional systolic alterations in patients and carriers with normal LVEF.",,,,2002-09-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Six children under 5 years with Duchenne dystrophy have been commenced on this schedule, four of whom have been followed for at least 30 months and are reported here. All four presented with classical Duchenne dystrophy, and had an out-of-frame deletion in the Duchenne gene and absence of dystrophin in their muscle. All four showed a rapid and dramatic response in muscle function and strength. In three of the four there was an almost complete remission of all clinical signs of dystrophy. Their functional scores remained well above the average scores recorded in untreated Duchenne boys at the same age. There was no increase in weight, stunting of growth, decreased bone density or any other significant side effects related to the prednisolone. Our current experience suggests that this intermittent, low-dosage prednisolone regime is well tolerated and can be safely given long-term in young children with Duchenne dystrophy. The striking response also suggests that there may be an optimal window for treatment of Duchenne dystrophy in the early stages of the disease.",,,,2002-09-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Experience with a multicentre double blind treatment study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and with consecutive steroid treatment documentation for up to 8 years enables us to identify a series of crucial points on which to focus while planning such clinical trials. The most important seem to be: a carefully structured, detailed study, clear-cut aims and objectives, expertise of investigators, sufficient training of examiners, and careful monitoring.

However, they do have side effects and despite a large number of published studies showing their efficacy, they are still not universally used. This is largely due to the lack of functional outcome and quality of life measures in most of the published studies and suggests that further trials might be required to answer some of the still unclear aspects of their role. Another important aspect of steroid therapy in Duchenne dystrophy is that we do not know how they work in dystrophic muscle. We have initiated a collaborative study on gene profiling using microarray in steroid-treated mdx mice. cDNA microarray studies were performed to examine the levels of skeletal muscle gene expression in a pool of mdx mice treated with prednisolone for 1 and 6 weeks. Interesting preliminary data on untreated mdx mice suggest that the gene profiling of young (7 weeks) versus older (12 weeks) mice is very significantly different. Furthermore, a large number of genes showed significant changes in expression at the mRNA level on treatment with prednisolone. These included structural protein genes; signalling genes and genes involved in immune response. Hopefully, analysis of this pattern of steroid-induced gene expression will provide some insight into understanding how glucocorticoids improve strength in Duchenne dystrophy, and may help in developing more effective and less toxic therapeutic approaches.",,,,2002-09-11,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Pre-clinical trials of prompt-to-use drugs need reliable animal models of the human disease to predict drug effectiveness in patients. The exercised mdx mouse develops a typical pattern of muscle weakness in vivo, which has already been used as an index on which to evaluate drug effectiveness. We have demonstrated that the macroscopic conductance to chloride ion, an index of degeneration-regeneration events occurring in mdx mouse muscles, is specifically impaired by a chronic exercise protocol and is sensitive to the action of in vivo administered drugs acting either by stimulating regeneration (insulin-like growth factor-1 and steroids) or by counteracting calcium-induced degeneration or inflammation (Taurine and steroids).

We have analyzed 112 cnMUPs and 84 mMUPs recorded from 7 patients with myopathy and 256 cnMUPs, 256 mMUPs from 14 healthy subjects. Biceps brachii muscle was investigated. Evaluated variables were duration, amplitude, area, number of phases, area/amplitude ratio, size index and area/number of phases ratio for cnMUPs, area and amplitude for mMUPs. Univariate statistical analysis and discriminant analysis for each parameter were performed.
The variable 'area ' gave rather good discrimination than duration, amplitude, number of phases, area/amplitude ratio, and size index. As demonstrated by discriminant analysis, area/phase ratio is more useful than area alone if myopathic MUPs had to be discriminated from normal MUPs. Discriminant efficiency of mMUP parameters were lower than all cnMUP parameters except number of phases.

To clarify such unresolved issues, we examined clinical findings in 47 patients with molecularly defined Xp deletion chromosomes accompanied by the breakpoints on Xp21-22 (group 1; n = 19), those accompanied by the breakpoints on Xp11 (group 2; n = 16), i(Xq) or idic(X)(p11) chromosomes (group 3; n = 8), and interstitial Xp deletion chromosomes (group 4; n = 4). The deletion size of each patient was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and microsatellite analyses for 38 Xp loci including SHOX, which was deleted in groups 1-3 and preserved in group 4. The mean GH-untreated adult height was -2.2 SD in group 1 and -2.7 SD in group 2 (GH-untreated adult heights were scanty in group 3). The prevalence of spontaneous breast development in patients aged 12.8 yr or more (mean +/- 2 SD for B2 stage) was 11 of 11 in group 1, 7 of 12 in group 2, and 1 of 7 in group 3. The prevalence of wrist abnormality suggestive of Madelung deformity was 8 of 18 in group 1 and 2 of 23 in groups 2 and 3, and 9 of 18 in patients with spontaneous puberty and 1 of 23 in those without spontaneous puberty. The prevalence of short neck was 1 of 19 in group 1 and 7 of 24 in groups 2 and 3. Soft tissue and visceral anomalies were absent in group 1 preserving the region proximal to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and were often present in groups 2 and 3 missing the region distal to monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). Multiple pigmented nevi were observed in groups 1-3, with the prevalence of 0 of 7 in patients less than 10 yr of age and 15 of 36 in those 10 yr or older regardless of the presence or absence of spontaneous puberty. Turner phenotype was absent in group 4, including a fetus aborted at 21 wk gestation who preserved the region distal to MAOA. The results provide further support for the idea that clinical features in X chromosome aberrations are primarily explained by haploinsufficiency of SHOX and the lymphogenic gene and by the extent of chromosome imbalance in mitotic cells and pairing failure in meiotic cells. Furthermore, it is suggested that 1) expressivity of SHOX haploinsufficiency in the limb and faciocervical regions is primarily influenced by gonadal function status and the presence or absence of the lymphogenic gene, respectively; 2) the lymphogenic gene for soft tissue and visceral stigmata is located between Duchenne muscular dystrophy and MAOA; and 3) multiple pigmented nevi may primarily be ascribed to cooperation between a hitherto unknown genetic factor and an age-dependent factor other than gonadal E.",,,,2001-11-10,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Immonologically related myoblast cultures (30 to 90 million cells per patient) were injected after all preliminary procedures into tibialis anterior muscles of four boys selected from a group of volunteer recipients (Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients) based on the analysis of a number of surface antigens in donor-recipient pairs. The condition of the patients remained satisfactory during the whole period of post-transplantation follow-up (from 6 months to 1.5 years). Six months after myoblast transplantation the presence of donor DNA or dystrophin synthesis was demonstrated in muscle biopsies of three out of four patients.

11642103,[Current state and prospects for gene therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the world and in Russia].,,Genetika,"Failure of drug therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) stimulated intense search for adequate methods of gene therapy (GT) which would ensure effective delivery of the dystrophin (D) gene, its long-term persistence in transfected cells, and its expression in muscle fibers. The main results of the experimental GT of DMD with the use of viral and nonviral delivery of the D gene into muscles of biological models are discussed. Delivery of a mini-gene of D with a specific muscle promoter using a modified adenoassociated virus is currently the most promising method, which will soon be available for clinical trials. The main results of the studies on the DMD GT in Russia are summarized. The results of experiments on genetic transfection of mdx mice with marker genes and various constructions with the D gene are outlined. The genes are delivered into muscles by means of gene gun, electroporation, viral oligopeptides, liposomes, microspheres, lactoferine, and other nonviral vehicles. It is emphasized that consolidation of funds and efforts of all Russian laboratories dealing with gene and cell therapy of DMD are necessary to complete the experiments and start clinical trials.",,,,2001-10-20,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
11558965,Lung clearance in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy with and without CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure).,,Experimental lung research,"Bronchiolar clearance was studied in 7 boys in the age range of 8 to 17 years, 6 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 1 with spinal muscular atrophy type II (SMA-II). These boys had healthy lungs but a severely reduced muscular strength (wheelchair dependent). In 6 of the boys, clearance was studied twice, at one occasion as a control and at the other occasion following treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A control group of healthy adults was used. In the clearance examinations, 6-microm Teflon particles, labeled with III In was inhaled extremely slowly, 0.05 L/s. This gives a deposition mainly in the bronchioles. Lung retention was measured after 0,24,48, and 72 hours. A model for deposition of particles in the adult lung was scaled down to represent the children in this study. Deposition in various airway generations was calculated to be similar in children and adults. Also the measured retentions were similar in the boys and the adults. In the clearance experiments during CPAP treatment, there was a significantly lower retention after 72 hours (but not after 24 and 48 hours) than in the control experiments. Theresults indicate that a severe reduction of muscular strength, and thereby a reduction of mechanical movement of the lung, does not affect clearance from large and small airways. However, some effect of clearance from small airways cannot be excluded due to the short measuring period. The small but significant effect of the CPAP treatment might have potential clinical importance and suggest that bronchiolar clearance can be affected by some form of mechanical force.",,,,2001-09-18,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
11530497,[Transplantation of normal or genetically modified myoblasts for the treatment of hereditary or acquired diseases].,,Journal de la Societe de biologie,"The clinical trials of myoblast transplantation in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients produced disappointing results. The main problems responsible for these poor results have since then been identified and partially resolved. One of them was related to the use of an inadequate immunosuppression and, since then, immunosuppression with FK506 has permitted successful myoblast transplantation not only in mice but also in monkeys. The requirement for a sustained immunosuppression may be eventually avoided by developing a state of tolerance to the allogeneic cells or by autologous transplantation of genetically corrected myoblasts or stem cells. The rapid death of 75-80% of the injected myoblasts during the first five days has also contributed to the limited success of the early trials. This death was due to an inflammatory reaction and has been compensated in animal experiments by the injection of a larger number of cells (30 millions per cc). Finally, the myoblasts migrated only 0.5 mm away from their site of injection. This problem is currently compensated in animal experiments by injecting the myoblasts at every mm. The number of injections required may eventually be reduced by transfecting myoblasts with one or several metalloproteinase genes. The very good results obtained during the last two years in primates permit us to undertake a new phase I clinical trial to verify that myoblast transplantation can lead to the formation of muscle fibers expressing normal dystrophin in muscles of DMD patients.",,,,2001-09-04,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
11462038,Enhancement of muscle gene delivery with pseudotyped adeno-associated virus type 5 correlates with myoblast differentiation.,,Journal of virology,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based muscle gene therapy has achieved tremendous success in numerous animal models of human diseases. Recent clinical trials with this vector have also demonstrated great promise. However, to achieve therapeutic benefit in patients, large inocula of virus will likely be necessary to establish the required level of transgene expression. For these reasons, efforts aimed at increasing the efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery to muscle have the potential for improving the safety and therapeutic benefit in clinical trials. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of gene delivery to mouse muscle cells for recombinant AAV type 2 (rAAV-2) and rAAV-2cap5 (AAV-2 genomes pseudo-packaged into AAV-5 capsids). Despite similar levels of transduction by these two vectors in undifferentiated myoblasts, pseudotyped rAAV-2cap5 demonstrated dramatically enhanced transduction in differentiated myocytes in vitro (>500-fold) and in skeletal muscle in vivo (>200-fold) compared to rAAV-2. Serotype-specific differences in transduction efficiency did not directly correlate with viral binding to muscle cells but rather appeared to involve endocytic or intracellular barriers to infection. Furthermore, application of this pseudotyped virus in a mouse model of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy also demonstrated significantly improved transduction efficiency. These findings should have a significant impact on improving rAAV-mediated gene therapy in muscle.",,,,2001-07-20,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
11382193,The current status of myoblast transfer.,,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,"As a means of correcting the defect in the muscles of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, myoblast transplantation has the advantage of utilizing normal biological mechanisms of repair of this tissue. Thus, it has the potential not only for correcting or complementing the genetic defect, but also for restoring the structure and function of pathologically damaged muscle tissue. However, it is also subject to many of the problems of other genetic therapies for muscle tissue, especially the problem of dispersing the therapeutic agent throughout the muscle mass and that of immune rejection of the genetically corrected tissue. In this article, these problems are discussed. In addition the history of cell transplantation therapy for DMD is presented as an example of the practical difficulties that arise from over eager application to human trials of preliminary data from animal experiments. Recent demonstrations that stem or early precursor cells from a muscle and from the bone marrow are able to disperse to sites of muscle damage via the blood vascular system and to participate in muscle repair raise the hope that this mode of therapy may be applicable to muscular dystrophies.",,,,2001-05-31,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

11360262,Clinical evaluator reliability for quantitative and manual muscle testing measures of strength in children.,,Muscle & nerve,"Measurements of muscle strength in clinical trials of Duchenne muscular dystrophy have relied heavily on manual muscle testing (MMT). The high level of intra- and interrater variability of MMT compromises clinical study results. We compared the reliability of 12 clinical evaluators in performing MMT and quantitative muscle testing (QMT) on 12 children with muscular dystrophy. QMT was reliable, with an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of >0.9 for biceps and grip strength, and >0.8 for quadriceps strength. Training of both subjects and evaluators was easily accomplished. MMT was not as reliable, and required repeated training of evaluators to bring all groups to an ICC >0.75 for shoulder abduction, elbow and hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. We conclude that QMT shows greater reliability and is easier to implement than MMT.

A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oxandrolone in boys with an established diagnosis of DD, using the change from baseline to 6 months in the average muscle strength score (MMT) as the primary efficacy measure.
The mean change from baseline for the oxandrolone group was +0.035 and that for the placebo group was -0.140. Although the oxandrolone group did not get worse and the placebo patients showed some deterioration in strength, the difference was not significant (p = 0.13). The average of the four quantitative muscle tests (QMT) showed a significant improvement in the oxandrolone-treated boys as compared with placebo. No adverse reactions attributable to oxandrolone were recorded.
Although oxandrolone did not produce a significant change in the average manual muscle strength score as compared with placebo, the mean change in QMT was significant.

11038066,Why do cultured transplanted myoblasts die in vivo? DNA quantification shows enhanced survival of donor male myoblasts in host mice depleted of CD4+ and CD8+ cells or Nk1.1+ cells.,,Cell transplantation,"Overcoming the massive and rapid death of injected donor myoblasts is the primary hurdle for successful myoblast transfer therapy (MTT), designed as a treatment for the lethal childhood myopathy Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The injection of male myoblasts into female host mice and quantification of surviving male DNA using the Y-chromosome-specific (Y1) probe allows the speed and extent of death of donor myoblasts to be determined. Cultured normal C57BL/10Sn male donor myoblasts were injected into untreated normal C57BL/10Sn and dystrophic mdx female host mice and analyzed by slot blots using a 32P-labeled Y1 probe. The amount of male DNA from donor myoblasts showed a remarkable decrease within minutes and by 1 h represented only about 10-18% of the 2.5 x 10(5) cells originally injected (designated 100%). This declined further over 1 week to approximately 1-4%. The host environment (normal or dystrophic) as well as the extent of passaging in tissue culture (early ""P3"" or late ""P15-20"" passage) made no difference to this result. Modulation of the host response by CD4+/CD8+ -depleting antibodies administered prior to injection of the cultured myoblasts dramatically enhanced donor myoblast survival in dystrophic mdx hosts (15-fold relative to untreated hosts after 1 week). NK1.1 depletion also dramatically enhanced donor myoblast survival in dystrophic mdx hosts (21-fold after 1 week) compared to untreated hosts. These results provide a strategic approach to enhance donor myoblast survival in clinical trials of MTT.",,,,2000-10-19,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Detailed systematic series (ie, 50) of axial MR images (T1-weighted, TR/TE 400/10 msec) were obtained throughout the whole body of each subject. The results showed that 15, 20, and 35 axial sections through the body are sufficient to secure coefficients of error (CEs) on the estimates of total muscle and fat volume of around 10%, 5%, and 3% respectively in muscular dystrophy patients and controls. The mean normalized volumes of muscle in four muscular dystrophy patients were decreased by 27% (t-test: P < 0.05), and those of total fat were increased by 12% (t-test: P > 0.05) relative to controls.

We followed the patients every 3 months for 1 year, evaluating four limb muscles with the Medical Research Council scale and performance of four functions (walking, climbing stairs, Gowers' maneuver, and rising from a chair). Side effects were monitored by a questionnaire and by routine blood examination, and weight and height were recorded at each visit. At 12 months, the effect of both steroids was examined by comparing the status of the treated patients with another group of untreated DMD patients that served as natural history control. The two steroids were equally effective in improving motor function and functional performances. At 9 months, the average weight increase with respect to baseline value was 5% (2 kg) in the deflazacort group but 18% in the prednisone group (P < 0. 005), and the change remained significant after 12 months (P < 0.05). Other minor but nonsignificant side effects were observed.

Sixteen patients with NMD (13 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 3 with spinal muscular atrophy) performed inspiratory muscle training (IMT) at home with a special training apparatus for 9 months. Maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PI(MAX)) and 12s-maximum voluntary ventilation (12s-MVV) test served as parameters for inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, respectively. In patients whose inspiratory vital capacity (VC(in)) declined by less than 10% during the year before training began (n = 10), a significant positive correlation was found between the number of successfully completed strength and endurance exercises and the improvement of PI(MAX) (P < 0.05) and 12s-MVV (P < 0.05). In patients whose VC(in)-decline exceeded 10% (n = 6), indicating more progressive respiratory system involvement of the disease, no significant correlation between the improvement of PI(MAX) and 12s-MVV and the intensity of training was found.

The Catalyzed Signal Amplification system is an extremely sensitive immunohistochemistry staining procedure based on the peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of a biotinylated phenolic compound. We used three mouse monoclonal antibodies: DYS1, DYS2, and DYS3. Muscle sections were treated using the Target Retrieval Solution(TM) and the Catalyzed Signal Amplification system. In control patients, DYS1 and DYS2 were stained at the sarcolemma, but DYS3 remained unstained. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, DYS1 and DYS2 staining were undetected. In Becker muscular dystrophy patients, the immunolabeling of DYSI and DYS2 were weak and discontinuous. In manifesting carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DYS1 and DYS2 staining showed a mosaic pattern of dystrophin-positive fibers and dystrophin-negative fibers. DYS1 and DYS2 staining patterns of this study are similar to those of frozen sections using conventional methods previously reported.

10788987,[Anesthetic complications. The incidence of severe anesthetic complications in patients and families with progressive muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne and Becker types].,,Der Anaesthesist,"During the last 30 years a great number of case reports presented severe anaesthetic complications with sudden cardiac arrest in patients with muscular dystrophies, mostly unsuspected at the time of the event. As succinylcholine was involved in the majority of the intractable incidents with lethal outcome the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States recommended a warning of the administration of succinylcholine in young children and adolescents in 1992 and an extensive international discussion on the routine use of succinylcholine in paediatric anaesthesia. Epidemiological studies on this issue are rare. We projected an inquiry about the incidence rate and type of severe anaesthetic complications in an utmost large number of patients and families with Duchenne (DMD) and Becker type (BMD) muscular dystrophy.
With the approval of the ethic committee of the university Witten/Herdecke and informed consent of the participants we investigated all patients and families who were diagnosed, controlled and treated for DMD or BMD as inpatients or outpatients in a ""Muscle Centre"" since 1983. The questionnaire asked for the number of patients per family, classification of the disease DMD or BMD, number and date of anaesthetics in the patients and eventual complications, anaesthetics and eventual complications in the parents, siblings and relatives and the occurrence of malignant hyperthermia (MH) in the family or relatives. Statistical assessments were done by Fisher's exact test for stratified 2 x 2 tables and Zelen's test for homogeneity of odds ratios.
200 out of 224 questionnaires could be evaluated. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular genetic and immunohistochemical investigations. In 147 families it turned out to be DMD, in 53 families BMD. The 212 male and 9 female patients in the 200 families were given 444 anaesthetics. Sudden cardiac arrest occurred in 6 patients, all successfully resuscitated. Nine less severe incidents consisted of fever, symptoms of rhabdomyolysis (CK-elevation, dark coloured urine, hyperkalemia) and masseter spasm. The statistical assessment revealed that the occurrence of an event was highly dependent whether the diagnosis of muscular dystrophy was established or not (p < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). All six cardiac arrests occurred in the 45 families with undiagnosed disease and no event happened in the 134 families with already known DMD/BMD. There was evidence that the number of anaesthetics without prior establishment of the diagnosis decreased after 1992 (p = 0.004, Fisher's exact test).
Our results demonstrate that severe incidents and cardiac arrests occurred only in young children with undiagnosed DMD or BMD who received inhalational agents and succinylcholine. A cardiac arrest in 6 out of 200 families was found much more frequently than in the normal paediatric population (about 1:1000 to 1:3000). The decrease of events after 1992 (warning of the FDA) and disappearance of sudden cardiac arrests in our group of patients might be due to the world wide discussion on routine use of succinylcholine in children or the much earlier establishment of the diagnosis in our population. An early diagnosis of DMD and BMD and the avoidance of the triggering agents succinylcholine and volatile anaesthetics can reduce the risk of severe anaesthetic complications.",,"200 out of 224 questionnaires could be evaluated.

10589852,Respiratory muscle training in neuromuscular disease: long-term effects on strength and load perception.,,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,"Deterioration of respiratory muscle function in patients with neuromuscular disorders is primarily responsible for the high morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases.
The potential benefit of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on preservation of respiratory muscle strength and respiratory load perception (RLP) was examined in 21 children (mean age: 12.2 +/- 1.8 yr [SD], 16 male) with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy type III, and in 20 age-, weight-, and sex-matched controls. Subjects were randomly allocated to undergo incremental RMT with resistive inspiratory and expiratory loads for a period of 6 months (trained group, TR) or to perform similar exercises with no load (NT). Maximal static inspiratory (Pi(max)) and expiratory (Pe(max)) pressures and RLP (modified Borg visual analog scale 0-10) were assessed on two separate occasions before beginning of the training protocol, monthly throughout RMT duration, and every 3-6 months upon cessation of RMT for 1 yr.
In controls, no significant changes in maximal static pressures or load perception occurred during RMT or thereafter. Training in neuromuscular disorder (NMD) patients was associated with improvements in Pi(max) (mean delta max: +19.8 +/- 3.8 cmH2O in TR vs +4.2 +/- 3.6 cmH2O in NT; P < 0.02) and in Pe(max) (mean delta max: +27.1 +/- 4.9 cmH2O in TR vs -1.8 +/- 3.4 cmH2O in NT; P < 0.004). Similarly, RLP significantly decreased during the RMT period in TR (mean delta: 1.9 +/- 0.3; P < 0.01) but did not change in NT (-0.2 +/- 0.2). In addition, with cessation of RMT, static pressures returned to pretraining values in TR within approximately 3 months. However, RLP was still improved after 12 months.
We conclude that in children with NMD, although RMT-induced increases in expiratory muscle strength are rapidly reversible, long-lasting improvements in RLP occur and could be associated with decreased respiratory symptoms.",,"In controls, no significant changes in maximal static pressures or load perception occurred during RMT or thereafter.

British volume,"Spinal fusion, ending caudally at L5 rather than at the sacrum, is recommended for selected patients with scoliosis due to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We present a retrospective review of 48 patients operated on for this condition. Patients having spinal curvature with a Cobb angle of less than 40 degrees and with less than 10 degrees between a line tangential to the superior margins of both iliac crests and a line perpendicular to the spinous processes of L4 and L5, were fused to L5 (38 patients); patients not meeting these criteria were fused to the sacrum (10 patients). Spinal and sitting obliquity increased in patients fused to L5, rather than to the sacrum, but the severity of the worsening obliquity was significantly greater in patients in whom the apex of the curve was below L1. Two of the ten latter patients required revision procedures for worsening obliquity when their pulmonary function deteriorated to less than 25% of predicted values. We recommend fusion to the sacrum for scoliosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, especially for patients with an apex to their curve below L1.",,,,1999-10-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Eight out of 34 unrelated DMD (BMD) patients (23.2%) were shown to carry a deletion varying in size from one to seven exons. Most DBs (15 out of 16, 93.7%) were in the distal region of the gene, commonly between exons 44-45, 45-47, and 50-52. Thus, high-polymorphic intergenic markers located in introns 44 (STR 44), 45 (STR 45), 49 (STR 49), and 50 (STR 50) can be used for indirect or direct carrier detection among women closely related to DMD patients that carry a deletion with DB located between exons 44-45, 45-47, and 50-52.

10382913,Lower limb surgery in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,"Two hundred and thirteen of 428 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) of a prospective and open study were operated on bilaterally with hip and knee release, aponeurectomy of the iliotibial band and Achilles tendon lengthening. In 87 patients the operation was carried out during early restrictions of the lower limb joint mobility at an average age of 6.56 years (4.02-8.26, SD 1.42). The follow-up was on average 5.4 years (0.25-9.01, SD 2.7). This group was compared to a control group (natural history) consisting of 100 non-operated DMD patients. A significant (P < 0.001) release of the contractures could be obtained. Loss of walking ability occurred in the control group at an average of 9.29 years (5.85-13.63, SD 1.98) and in the operated group at an average of 10.55 years (8.17-14.39, SD 1.76). This shows that early lower limb surgery leads to a prolongation of independent ambulation of 1.25 years on average. In contrast to the patients of the control group all treated patients between ages 6 and 8 years could walk independently. The positive influence of early lower limb surgery could also be shown by the development of Hammersmith motor ability score, CIDD (Council of Investigation of Duchenne Dystrophy) grading and Vignos scale. Nevertheless, in consideration of the well-known course of DMD not only the prolongation of ambulation but also the achieved prolongation of assisted standing ability with no or mild contractures are aims of lower limb surgery. Since no improvement of muscle strength could be observed after lower limb surgery, further studies have to investigate if additionally administered steroids can prolong ambulation after early lower limb surgery.",,,,1999-06-26,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

An indication is given of the gene therapy trials that have been carried out in animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with emphasis on the Golden Retriever dog model. Problems facing somatic gene therapy for inherited muscle diseases are predominantly the following: the extent of the spread of expression from the injection site, the duration of expression and the need for systemic delivery. Brief details of the problems are given and possible ways of overcoming the difficulties are outlined. These include the use of multiple intramuscular injections, increasing the permeability of the extracellular matrix of muscle, inducing mitosis in myoblasts, the use of ex vivo gene transfer, using modified viruses as vectors or synthesized transporter molecules, the use of mechanisms which combat the action of killer T cells, upregulation of isoforms or of alternative proteins such as utrophin for dystrophin and the use of genetic correction methods such as the use of antisense oligonucleotides.

10193393,Impact of nasal ventilation on survival in hypercapnic Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Thorax,"Respiratory failure is the commonest cause of death in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Life expectancy is less than one year once diurnal hypercapnia develops. This study examines the effects of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on survival in symptomatic Duchenne patients with established ventilatory failure.
Nocturnal NIPPV was applied in 23 consecutive patients with DMD of mean (SD) age 20.3 (3.4) years who presented with diurnal and nocturnal hypercapnia.
One year and five year survival rates were 85% (95% CI 69 to 100) and 73% (95% CI 53 to 94), respectively. Early changes in arterial blood gas tensions following NIPPV occurred with mean (SD) PO2 increasing from 7.6 (2.1) kPa to 10.8 (1.3) kPa and mean (SD) PCO2 falling from 10.3 (4.5) kPa to 6.1 (1.0) kPa. Improvements in arterial blood gas tensions were maintained over five years. Health perception and social aspects of SF-36 health related quality of life index were reported as equivalent to other groups with nonprogressive disorders using NIPPV.

TGF-beta1 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle from laminin alpha2-negative and laminin alpha2-positive CMD patients were significantly greater than in controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively), while in partial laminin alpha2-deficient muscular dystrophy patients the amount was not significantly higher than in controls (P > 0.1). The TGF-beta1 values were lower than those found in DMD, although the extent of fibrosis was greater in CMD than in DMD and controls.

9689395,[Incidence of disposition for malignant hyperthermia in patients with neuromuscular diseases].,,"Anasthesiologie, Intensivmedizin, Notfallmedizin, Schmerztherapie : AINS","It has been suggested that malignant hyperthermia (MH) occurs more frequent in patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD) than in patients without NMD when they are exposed to volatile anaesthetics and/or succinylcholine. However, whereas central core disease (CCD) and MH susceptibility (MHS) are closely associated, the relationship between MH and other NMD is still uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the MH status of individuals with specific NMD with the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) and to ascertain the risk for MH in individuals with NMD.
After institutional approval and informed consent, 29 patients of 3-59 years of age (27.2 +/- 17.3) with clinical suspicion for NMD and MH were enrolled in this prospective study. After excision of a skeletal muscle sample from M. vastus lateralis, patients were first classified as MHS, MH-equivocal (MHE) and MH-normal (MHN) by the IVCT according to the European MH protocol. Additionally, small muscle samples were excised from each patient for histological, histochemical and morphometric examination.
Fourteen patients were diagnosed by the IVCT as MHS and 9 as MHN. In 6 patients MH status was equivocal. In six patients CCD was diagnosed, in 14 individuals muscular dystrophies and in 5 patients myotonias. Two patients had unspecific myopathies and one patient a carnitine deficiency syndrome. One patient with Friedreich's ataxia was investigated because of a MH crisis and classified as MHE. All CCD patients and two of three individuals with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy were tested as MHS.
In this study 69% of the NMD patients were diagnosed as susceptible to MH with the IVCT. These results suggest, that NMD patients bear a high risk for MH. On the other hand, it has been discussed that in vitro contracture testing is not specific in NMD patients because skeletal muscle specimens from these patients have an elevated in vitro sensitivity. However, regarding our results and from a clinical point of view, patients with NMD should be treated like MHS individuals, unless they have undergone IVCT and were classified as MH-normal.",,"Fourteen patients were diagnosed by the IVCT as MHS and 9 as MHN.

9666302,Murray L. Barr Award Lecture. Studies of the dynamics of skeletal muscle regeneration: the mouse came back!,,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,"Regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue includes sequential processes of muscle cell proliferation and commitment, cell fusion, muscle fiber differentiation, and communication between cells of various tissues of origin. Central to the process is the myosatellite cell, a quiescent precursor cell located between the mature muscle fiber and its sheath of external lamina. To form new fibers in a muscle damaged by disease or direct injury, satellite cells must be activated, proliferate, and subsequently] fuse into an elongated multinucleated cell. Current investigations in the field concern modulation of the effectiveness of skeletal muscle regeneration, the regeneration-specific role of myogenic regulatory gene expression distinct from expression during development, the impact of growth and scatter factors and their respective receptors in amplifying precursor numbers, and promoting fusion and maturation of new fibers and the ultimate clinical therapeutic applications of such information to alleviate disease. One approach to muscle regeneration integrates observations of muscle gene expression, proliferation, myoblast fusion, and fiber growth in vivo with parallel studies of cell cycling behaviour, endocrine perturbation, and potential biochemical markers of steps in the disease-repair process detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. Experiments on muscles from limb, diaphragm, and heart of the mdx dystrophic mouse, made to parallel clinical trials on human Duchenne muscular dystrophy, help to elucidate mechanisms underlying the positive treatment effects of the glucocorticoid drug deflazacort. This review illustrates an effective combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to integrate the distinctive complexities of post-natal myogenesis in regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue.",,,,1998-07-17,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We present the patterns of deletions of the dystrophin gene in Argentine population. DNA from 75 patients with DMD/BMD was analyzed by multiplex PCR and, in some cases, cDNA/Southern. Deletions were detected in 24 patients (32%) and were mainly clustered in two areas of the dystrophin gene: the 5' end (exons 3-12) and the central part (exons 44-53). 64% of the deletion endpoints lay in the middle region and 34% in the 5' end of the gene. The most frequent sites for deletion-endpoints were in the introns 47 (13.6%), 44 (11%), 2 (9%) and 12 (7%). Thus, the proportion and distribution of deletions in our DMD/BMD patients differ from those reported for other populations. Furthermore, a higher proportion of deletions was observed in familial cases (40%) than in isolated ones (30%), in contrast to previously reported data. The effect of the deletion on the reading frame agree with the phenotype in almost all the patients studied.

Patients with DMD develop in the majority a progressive scoliosis when they cease walking and/or standing at the age of 10 years and become confined to a wheelchair. Increasing muscle weakness leads to a progression of the curvature, the pelvic tilt and problems in sitting. Together with the simultaneous progressive weakness of the respiratory muscles a restrictive pulmonary insufficiency will occur. Surgical stabilization of the spine (> 20 degrees Cobb, forced vital capacity > 35%) by an adequate multisegmental instrumentation enabling early mobilization is now the treatment of choice. However, orthotic treatment may offer an acceptable compromise in exceptional cases, if the patient rejects surgical intervention or is in the late (inoperable) stages of the disease. Such a treatment is superior to a primary sitting support provision with insufficient possibilities of correction. The authors' experiences with 48 scoliosis orthoses made for 28 patients with DMD are reported. A ""double plaster"" cast has emerged as the best method to optimize adaption, especially in severe curvatures and the time taken for manufacturing the orthosis.

Donor nuclei were detected in all biopsies analyzed, including nine where no donor myoblasts were previously thought to be present. In three patients, more than 10% of the original number of donor cells were calculated as present 6 months after implantation. Half of the detected donor nuclei were fused into host myofibers, and of these, nearly 50% produced dystrophin. These findings demonstrate that although donor myoblasts have persisted after injection, their microenvironment influences whether they fuse and express dystrophin.

9278346,Prevention by anti-LFA-1 of acute myoblast death following transplantation.,,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","Myoblast transplantation is a potential treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One of the problems possibly responsible for the limited success of clinical trials is the rapid death of the myoblasts after transplantation. To investigate this problem, myoblasts expressing beta-galactosidase were injected in the tibialis anterior muscles of mice. Beta-galactosidase activity was reduced by 74.7% after 3 days. Myoblast death observed at 3 days was reduced to 57.2% when the hosts were irradiated. This result suggested that host cells were contributing to this phenomenon. Transplantation in SCID and FK506-treated mice did not reduce cell death, indicating that mortality was not due to an acute specific reaction. In contrast, administration of the anti-LFA-1 (TIB-213) mAb markedly reduced myoblast death at 3 days without altering leukocyte tissue infiltration. We postulated that neutrophils were mediating myoblast mortality by an LFA-1-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, IL-1beta-activated myoblasts were loaded with 6-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, di(acetoxymethylester) (DCFH), a marker for oxidative stress. Addition of neutrophils and zymosan-activated serum resulted in a time-dependent DCFH fluorescence; this neutrophil-induced oxidation was considerably inhibited by TIB-213. These results indicate that an effective control of the inflammatory reaction will be necessary for any new clinical trials of myoblast transplantation and suggest that neutrophil-mediated myoblast injury occurs by an LFA-1-dependent pathway.",,,,1997-09-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) was administered for 7 months. Pre- and postimplantation (after 1 and 6 months) muscle biopsies were analyzed. Force generation (tetanic tension and maximum voluntary contraction) was measured monthly in a double-blind design. There was increased force generation in both legs of all boys, probably due to cyclosporine. Using the polymerase chain reaction, evidence of myoblast survival and dystrophin mRNA expression was obtained in 3 patients after 1 month and in 1 patient after 6 months.

The present study has been carried out in order to precise the degree of regeneration at different stages of the disease, by analyzing the expression of several markers of cell proliferation and of muscular differentiation. In the two affected foetuses of our series, the m. quadriceps is histologically normal, except for the absent expression of immunoreactive dystrophin. The quadriceps from the eight children of our series (20 months-16 years) all present clear dystrophic changes. Muscle regeneration is characterized by activation of the satellite cells, by their multiplication followed by their fusion giving birth to regenerative fibers. By studying the expression of muscular markers (vimentin, desmin, isoforms of the myosin heavy chains), it has been possible to define more precisely the degree of maturation and of differentiation of these regenerative fibers.

This article confirms by experiments in mice that one problem that has limited the success of clinical trials of this procedure is a rapid (within 3 days) inflammatory reaction which kills most of the injected myoblasts. The death of the transplanted myoblasts can be prevented by treating the host with a mAb against LFA-1. This led to a 27-fold increase in the number of muscle fibers expressing a reporter gene present in the donor myoblasts when the host is also adequately immunosuppressed with FK506. Therefore, both the nonspecific inflammatory reaction and the specific immune response should be adequately controlled following myoblast transplantation.",,,,1997-03-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The trial design was effective in maintaining blinding but theophylline adversely affected sleep quality and sleep hypoxaemia.

In contrast, Siegel et al. could not find any significant effect of glucocorticoid in a controlled study. There then followed notable absence in formal trials until Brooke et al. published interesting results in a trial of prednisone in 1987. This was subsequently followed by a series of short term, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. These studies demonstrated that glucocorticoid could slow the rate of decline of muscle strength. We also investigated the effect of glucocorticoid in 10 DMD patients taking a dosage of prednisolone 1 mg/kg on alternate day. Seven patients of those maintained activities of daily living after 48 weeks of treatment, but the benefits did not last over 192 weeks in any patient. Glucocorticoid therapy may be a valuable option in DMD patients because that no effective medical treatment is currently available. It does significantly slow the progress of disease for at least 3 years. Benefits must be weighed against expected side effects from glucocorticoid. Further studies are needed to establish optimal treatment schedules using prednisolone and develop therapeutic agents with fewer side-effects. The mechanism of beneficial effect of glucocorticoid is unknown.",,,,1996-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
9027857,"Abnormalities in alpha-, beta- and gamma-sarcoglycan in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.",,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,"We have identified 12 cases from a group of 45 patients with early onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), who have a deficiency of the 50 kDa dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, alpha-sarcoglycan. An additional male sibling of one case was also studied clinically. All 12 patients showed a concomitant, but variable, deficiency of alpha-, beta- and gamma-sarcoglycan. None of our patients had a defect in only one component of the sarcoglycan complex. Molecular analysis confirmed that a total absence of one sarcoglycan, associated with reduced expression of the other two, indicates a primary defect. Immunocytochemistry is thus useful for directing molecular studies. Morphological features not usually observed in Xp21 dystrophies were peripheral accumulations of mitochondria, discrete core-like areas, and nemaline rods in one case. Clinical severity and progression was variable between and within families but early loss of ambulation, at or before the age of 12 years, was associated with a total absence of gamma-sarcoglycan. Common clinical features were calf hypertrophy, contractures of the tendo achilles, lumbar lordosis, winging of the scapulae, weak hamstrings and weak neck muscles. All cases had grossly elevated serum creatine kinase. In contrast to patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), our patients with sarcoglycan deficiencies had normal early motor milestones, normal intellect, and good respiratory and cardiac function. Our data confirm that the sarcoglycan complex acts as a unit and that morphological and clinical features can distinguish patients with defects in the sarcoglycans from those with Xp21 dystrophy. In our group of patients prognosis is better than in DMD, but clinical variability makes this difficult to predict in isolated cases.",,,,1996-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We describe a sensitive, reliable and convenient ""two-antibody sandwich"" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. This system, using a capture antibody specific for carboxyl terminus and two different detection antibodies for the mid-rod domain and the amino-terminal domain, is highly specific for dystrophin, since muscle specimens from DMD patients gave almost zero response (n = 3, 0.38 approximately 0.45%; expressed as a percentage of normal muscle tissue). This assay should prove to be an accessible and useful tool for the diagnosis of DMD/BMD and for the evaluation in clinical trials such as myoblast transfer and gene therapy.",,,,1996-09-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
8965839,Rapid death of injected myoblasts in myoblast transfer therapy.,,Muscle & nerve,Myoblast transplantation has been proposed as a potential therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A Y-chromosome-specific probe was used to track the fate of donor male myoblasts injected into dystrophic muscles of female mdx mice (which are an animal model for DMD). In situ analysis with the Y-probe showed extremely poor survival of isolated normal male (C57B1/10Sn) donor myoblasts after injection into injured or uninjured muscles of dystrophic (mdx) and normal (C57B1/10Sn) female host mice. A decrease in the numbers of donor (male) myoblasts was seen from 2 days and was marked by 7 days after injection: few or no donor myoblasts were detected in host muscles examined at 3-12 months. There was limited movement of the injected donor myoblasts and fusion into host myofibers was rare. The results of this study strongly suggest that the failure of clinical trials of myoblast transplantation in boys with DMD may have been due to rapid and massive death of the donor myoblasts soon after myoblast injection.,,,,1996-07-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Twenty-three patients with DMD and twenty age-matched healthy volunteers were studied. An abnormal SA-ECG was defined as an area ratio of high frequency components/low frequency components over the 97th percentile of normal controls. Frequency domain analysis of the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex and 80 ms of the initial ST segment was most predictive for distinguishing DMD patients at risk for ventricular tachycardia (VT). Although filter processing reduced the power of low frequency components and increased the area ratios, the sensitivity for the prediction of VT was not significantly enhanced. The area ratios of 40-100 Hz/0-40 Hz were superior to the area ratios of 20-50 Hz/0-20 Hz for predicting patients with VT.",,,,1996-03-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Deletions, analyzed by multiplex amplification of selected exons, were observed in 58% (38 cases) of the patients. It was found that exon 48 was the most frequently affected, while exon 44 was the least frequently affected. The number of deleted exons was variable, but single exon deletions were more frequent (41%) than larger deletions in our population and the great majority of deletions began distal to exon 44. The application of PCR to deletion analysis in D/BMD was found to be very useful in delineating the extent of the deletion in most of the cases (82%). It was seen that the frequency of deletion breakpoints in distal part of the dystrophin gene (exons 42-52) was detected in 64% of our cases. In our group, the frequency of deletion breakpoints in the same area of the dystrophin gene was between that of the French and the Finnish patients. The distribution of deletion breakpoints within the dystrophin gene of the Turkish population seems to have some differences from other populations. Deletion breakpoints were found to be clustered mainly in three separate regions covering introns 44, 45 and 50 within the central region of the dystrophin gene. Intron 44 was mostly 5' breakpoints but it was found not to be involved as 3' breakpoints. The correlation between phenotype and type of deletion agreed with the reading frame theory except for one DMD case.",,,,1996-03-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
9027595,Cancer risk factors for selecting cohorts for large-scale chemoprevention trials.,,Journal of cellular biochemistry. Supplement,"Many anticipate that application of findings in molecular genetics will help to achieve greater precision in defining high-risk populations that may benefit from chemopreventive interventions. We must recognize, however, that genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and complex gene-environment interactions are all likely to be risk determinants for most cancers. Cohort studies of twins and cancer indicate that having ""identical"" genes is generally not a very accurate predictor of cancer incidence. Data from twin studies support the suggestion that environmental factors such as tobacco use significantly influence cancer risk. The complexities of the genetic contribution to disease risk are exemplified by the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in only one of monozygotic twin girls, hypothesized to be the result of X chromosome inactivation, with the distribution patterns of the X chromosome being skewed to the female X in the manifesting twin and to the male X in the normal twin. Evidence from transgenic and genetic-environmental studies in animals support the possibility of genetic-environmental interactions. Calorie restriction modifies tumor expression in p53 knockout mice; a high-fat, low-calcium, low-vitamin D diet increases prepolyp hyperplasia formation in Apc-mutated mice; and calorie restriction early in life influences development of obesity in the genetically obese Zucker rat (fafa). Such environmental modulation of gene expression suggests that chemoprevention has the potential to reduce risk for both environmentally and genetically determined cancers. In view of the growing research efforts in chemoprevention, the NCI has developed a Prevention Trials Decision Network (PTDN) to formalize the evaluation and approval process for large-scale chemoprevention trials. The PTDN addresses large trial prioritization and the associated issues of minority recruitment and retention; identification and validation of biomarkers as intermediate endpoints for cancer; and chemopreventive agent selection and development. A comprehensive database is being established to support the PTDN's decision-making process and will help to determine which agents investigated in preclinical and early phase clinical trials should move to large-scale testing. Cohorts for large-scale chemoprevention trials include individuals who are determined to be at high risk as a result of genetic predisposition, carcinogenic exposure, or the presence of biomarkers indicative of increased risk. Current large-scale trials in well-defined, high-risk populations include the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (tamoxifen), the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (finasteride), and the N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) breast cancer prevention study being conducted in Milan. Biomarker studies will provide valuable information for refining the design and facilitating the implementation of future large-scale trials. For example, potential biomarkers are being assessed at biopsy in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The women are then randomized to either placebo, tamoxifen, 4-HPR, or tamoxifen plus 4-HPR for 2-4 weeks, at which time surgery is performed and the biomarkers reassessed to determine biomarker modulation by the interventions. For prostate cancer, modulation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) by 4-HPR and difluoromethylornithine is being investigated; similar studies are being planned for oltipraz, dehydroepiandrosterone, and vitamin E plus selenomethionine. The validation of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints for cancer incidence in high-risk cohorts will allow more agents to be evaluated in shorter studies that use fewer subjects to achieve the desired statistical power.",,,,1996-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We have evaluated efficiency of systemic and intramuscular injections, the impact of age at injection, the duration of expression in adult normal and genetically-immunosuppressed SCID mice, using a recombinant adenovirus expressing a reporter gene. After adenovirus-mediated transfer of a mini-model, we have shown an efficient and stable expression of the transgene, a long-term correction of the degeneration process and a functional protection of the treated muscle.

Subjects underwent total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW) assessment by deuterium and bromide dilution, respectively. Multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis (MFBIA) was performed on all subjects with the aim to establish its accuracy in predicting TBW and ECW in DMD.

Notched T waves were more frequently observed in patients with DMD than in control subjects (46.7% vs. 20.0%, p < 0.05). Moreover, their frequency was age-independent in DMD, whereas they decreased with age in controls. Patients with notched T waves showed significantly increased heart rate, prolonged QTc and augmented excretion of urinary adrenaline compared with patients without them. There were no significant differences in casual BP or incidences of characteristic UCG abnormalities, such as mitral valve prolapse, and ECG abnormalities, such as tall R waves in the right precordial leads, between DMD patients with and without notched T waves.

The mean age of DMD patients at time of operation was 6.1 years. The mean follow-up was 3.4 years. All children underwent mobilisation the day after surgery. Complete correction of all contractures was immediately achieved after operation and kept in all but two cases up to the follow-up examination after 3.4 years. No loss of ambulation was observed. Our results demonstrate that early selective surgery in DMD patients just at or better before the onset of contractures without performing an additional aponeurectomy of the iliotibial band and percutaneous tenotomy of the hamstrings according to the original Glorion-Rideau technique safely prevents severe contractures and thereby delays the progression of scoliosis.",,,,1995-10-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
7651473,Myoblast transfer in the treatment of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.,,The New England journal of medicine,"Myoblast transfer has been proposed as a technique to replace dystrophin, the skeletal-muscle protein that is deficient in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Donor myoblasts injected into muscles of affected patients can fuse with host muscle fibers, thus contributing their nuclei, which are potentially capable of replacing deficient gene products. Previous controlled trials involving a single transfer of myoblasts have been unsuccessful.
We injected donor muscle cells once a month for six months to the biceps brachii muscles of one arm of each of 12 boys with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The opposite arms served as sham-injected controls. In each procedure 110 million cells donated by fathers or brothers were transferred. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either cyclosporine or placebo. Strength was measured by quantitative isometric muscle testing. Six months after the final myoblast transfer, the presence of dystrophin was assessed with the use of peptide antibodies specific to the deleted exons of the dystrophin gene.
There was no significant difference in muscle strength between arms injected with myoblasts and sham-injected arms. In one patient, 10.3 percent of muscle fibers expressed donor-derived dystrophin after myoblast transfer. Three other patients also had a low level of donor dystrophin (< 1 percent); eight had none.
Myoblasts transferred once a month for six months failed to improve strength in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The value of exon-specific peptide antibodies in the interpretation of myoblast-transfer results was demonstrated in a patient with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy who had a high percentage of donor-derived dystrophin.

7668311,Octreotide enhances positive calcium balance in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,The American journal of the medical sciences,"Although receptors for somatostatin are found in bone cells, the effect of somatostatin analogs on calcium metabolism is unknown. The authors studied, in a metabolic ward, the effect of octreotide (a long-acting somatostatin analog) and a placebo in two 6-day calcium balance periods in 8 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. As expected, octreotide (2 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously, every 8 hours) reduced serum growth hormone and somatomedin (IGF-1) to levels found in growth hormone deficiency. Octreotide enhanced calcium retention by 30% (96 mg daily [P < 0.04]) in 7 boys for whom complete data (diet, urine, and fecal calcium) were available. In 6 children with urinary calcium excretion (Uca) greater than 50 mg daily, octreotide markedly lowered Uca, from 114 +/- 23 mg daily to 61 +/- 9 mg daily (P < 0.03). Calcium retention occurred in patients with or without initial hypercalciuria, but the higher the basal Uca, the greater was the inhibition by octreotide (r = 0.79; P < 0.03). Inactive, nonambulatory patients had a more pronounced response of Uca to octreotide (P < 0.02). Octreotide caused a mild, nonsignificant reduction in fecal calcium, with no major changes in serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, urinary excretion of sodium and potassium, or in creatinine clearance. Based on the current observations and the presence of receptors for somatostatin in bone cells, this hormone may have, at least on a short-term basis, an anabolic effect on calcium, perhaps favoring its deposition in bone.",,,,1995-09-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to increase for patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 yr (range, 5-41) satisfied criteria for having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEFs < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 yr. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM.

They were treated for three months with 100 mg daily of CoQ10 and a matching placebo. The second double-blind trial was similar with fifteen patients having the same categories of disease. Since cardiac disease is established to be associated with these muscle diseases, cardiac function was blindly monitored, and not one mistake was made in assigning CoQ10 and placebo to the patients in both trials. Definitely improved physical performance was recorded. In retrospect, a dosage of 100 mg was too low although effective and safe.

Before exercise, the force generation of dystrophic muscle and the compound muscle action potential amplitude were lower and half-relaxation time of the tetanus was longer in patients than in controls. During exercise, the decline in tetanic force and potentiation in twitch tension were similar in both groups. However, during exercise, there was less decline in maximum voluntary contraction and less added force in DMD patients, suggesting that there was less central fatigue in patients than in controls. Thus, patients with DMD and controls have similar intramuscular fatigability and excitation-contraction coupling, and central activation in patients is functioning as well as or better than in healthy controls.",,,,1995-02-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
8882570,Deflazacort vs. prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: trends of an ongoing study.,,Brain & development,"Several studies have demonstrated the slowing effect of corticosteroids on the decline of muscle strength in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Deflazacort (DFC) is supposed to have fewer side effects than prednisone (PRED). An ongoing double blind multicenter study is comparing the effects and side effects of deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day) and prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) in DMD. This interim report includes data for 67 boys between age 5 years and loss of ambulation. Besides the common clinical and laboratory data for chronic corticoid treatment, motor performance has been tested. Interim results, 3-15 months after starting the medication, show some scattering but no grouping of data for all the functions tested: timed motor functions, sum of the strength of 20 muscles according to a 10-point scale on manual testing, weight gain, osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase. Only the changes in CK activity after 3 months medication might reflect two equal groups without any correlation with the initial activity or with other parameters. On average, there was no clear-cut loss of muscle strength or performance. Except for in 4 patients, who were excluded due to unacceptable weight gain and/or loss of ambulation, there were no side effects considered to be serious. The results suggest that (i) DFC and PRED in equal anti-inflammatory dosage are similarly or equally efficient in slowing down the decline of muscle strength in DMD; (ii) benefits outweigh the side effects. This allows the study to continue as designed.",,,,1995-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

In 57 patients (group I) this was carried out prophylactically as retractions of the lower limb joints were just beginning at the age of 6.4 +/- 1.43 years and in 66 patients (group II) as mild contractures of the joints at the end of walking ability were already manifest with an average age of 9.27 +/- 1.86 years. The average follow-up was 3.7 +/- 1.2 years in both groups. To be able to assess the interindividual course of both groups, we defined ""joint and motor quotients"", which allowed a complex assessment of joint function and motoric capacity. In addition, both groups were compared with a control group (natural history) consisting of 100 non-operated DMD patients. In both groups a significant release of the contractures could be obtained primarily. Patients in group I showed a much better long-term effect than those in group II. The motor quotient in group I was significantly better over the whole follow-up period (P < 0.001) than in group II or the control group. The prolongation of walking ability by about 2 years compared with the natural history is in our opinion not the central goal of this surgical treatment concept of lower limbs in DMD, but rather the additionally achieved prolongation of an assisted standing ability with the lower limbs free from contractures and deformities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,1995-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The manifesting carriers had variable degrees of weakness; the presumptive carrier had no weakness. Morphological abnormalities were also variable and were most marked in the young manifesting carriers. The three young manifesting carriers and the presumptive carrier had a mosaic pattern of dystrophin-positive and dystrophin-negative fibres. All the dystrophin-associated proteins were reduced in the dystrophin-deficient fibres, giving a similar mosaic pattern to dystrophin. Expression of dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated proteins was normal in the adult manifesting carrier. Utrophin was detected on the sarcolemma of fibres both with and without dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated proteins. Thus, dystrophin and utrophin are co-expressed in several fibres in carriers. The results emphasize the close association between dystrophin and the glycoprotein complex and their role in the pathogenesis of muscle damage. In addition, the presence of utrophin in fibres with greatly reduced glycoproteins suggests that very little of the glycoprotein complex may be required to anchor the amount of utrophin expressed at the sarcolemma in these particular cases.",,,,1994-09-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Paralysis of respiratory muscles causes a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) from age 12 years, and death occurs between 20 and 25 years old and is usually related to respiratory insufficiency. Uncontrolled studies suggest that early home use of nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in DMD patients free of respiratory failure could limit progression of the restrictive syndrome and therefore improve survival because efficacy of preventive NIPPV has not been demonstrated in a controlled trial, we undertook a randomised multicentre study in which 70 patients with DMD were included. Patients were free of daytime respiratory failure and FVC was between 20 and 50% of predicted values. At least 6 h of nocturnal NIPPV (n = 35) was compared with conventional treatment (n = 35). During a mean follow-up of 52 months, 10 patients died, 8 in the NIPPV group and 2 in the control group (p = 0.05, log-rank test). No differences were observed between the two groups for occurrence of hypercapnia, decrease of FVC below 20% of initial values, or use of necessary mechanical ventilation.

Of these, eight implanted (28%) and produced three ongoing pregnancies, three deliveries of four babies and a biochemical pregnancy. However, one case screened for cystic fibrosis was misdiagnosed and the pregnancy was terminated. In order to evaluate the efficiency of multiplex PCR, 55 non-replaced embryos were reassessed by PCR or by FISH. Identical results were obtained in all cases. However, one embryo which had only X-chromosome specific amplification by PCR was found to be XO in all its cells by FISH.

The deflazacort group showed significant improvement in climbing stairs (P < 0.01), in rising from a chair, Gower's maneuver, and walking (P < 0.0025) after 6 months of treatment. After 1 year, all the above changes remained significantly improved and the MRC index was significantly better (P < 0.05) in the treated group. After 2 years, a significant change was found in the MRC index: higher scores in walking, chair rising (P < 0.02), and grade and time of Gower's maneuver (P < 0.05) were found. The mean time for loss of ambulation for the treated group after we started the trial was 33.2 +/- 9 months; for the placebo group it was 20.5 +/- 11 months (deflazacort vs. placebo group, P < 0.05) [corrected].

8306750,Inspiratory muscle training in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Chest,"The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of a specific inspiratory muscle training in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Fifteen patients with DMD started 6 months of training the inspiratory muscles and 15 patients served as a control group. Pulmonary and inspiratory muscle function parameters were assessed 3 months before and at the beginning of training, in the first and third month of training, at the end, and 6 months after its cessation. Maximal sniff assessed esophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure values served as indices for global inspiratory muscle strength and diaphragmatic strength, respectively. Inspiratory muscle endurance was assessed by the length of time a certain inspiratory task could be maintained.
In 10 of the 15 patients, respiratory muscle function parameters improved significantly after 1 month of training. Further improvements were to be seen after 3 and after 6 months. Even 6 months after the end of training, those effects remained to a large extent. In the other five patients, there was no such improvement after 1 month of training, which was therefore discontinued. All these five patients had vital capacity values of less than 25 percent predicted and/or PaCO2 values of more than 45 mm Hg.

8289083,Corticosteroid therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Journal of the neurological sciences,"In recent years, various clinical trials have documented the benefit of glucocorticoid therapy in the palliation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Prednisone therapy, daily or on alternate days, has been confirmed to be of value in enhancing muscle strength and function in DMD for up to two years. However, there is evidence that corticosteroid treatment results in muscle weakness and degeneration. This review, therefore, examines the available studies and addresses various possible mechanisms involved in the efficacy of prednisone therapy and amelioration of DMD. The progression of DMD is known to be associated with profound changes in structure, biochemistry and physiology of the affected muscles. It is hypothesized, therefore, that these very changes offer a fortunate set of circumstances, and it is owing to these alterations, as well as the well known anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive action of steroid, that muscles in DMD are rendered responsive resulting in significant improvement of muscle bulk and function.",,,,1993-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Through 48 injections, five billion (55.6 x 10(6)/mL) normal myoblasts were transferred into 22 major muscles in both lower limbs, in 10 min with the subject under general anesthesia. Ten subjects received myoblasts cultured from satellite cells derived from 1-g fresh muscle biopsies of normal males aged 9-21 yr. Donor myoblasts for the remaining 22 boys were subcultured from reserves frozen 1 mo-1.5 yr ago. Only four donors were known to have identical histocompatibility with their recipients. All subjects took oral doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine (Cy), beginning at 2 days before MTT and lasting for 6 mo after MTT to facilitate donor cell survival. There was no evidence of an adverse reaction to MTT or Cy as determined by serial laboratory evaluations including electrolytes, creatinine, and urea. Objective functional tests using the KinCom Robotic Dynamometer measured the maximum isometric contractile forces of the ankle plantar flexors (AF), knee flexors (KF), and knee extensors (KE) before MTT and at 3, 6, and 9 mo after MTT. The AF, being distal muscles and less degenerative than the KE and the KF, showed no decrease in mean contractile force 3 mo after MTT, and progressive increases in force at 6 and 9 mo after MTT. At 9 mo after MTT, 60% of the 60 AF examined showed a mean increase of 50% in force; 28% showed no change; and only 12% showed a mean decrease in force of 29% when compared to the function of the same muscles before MTT. The KF, being proximal muscles and more degenerative, showed no change in function at 9 mo after MTT. The KE, being proximal and anti-gravitational, were most degenerative before MTT. They showed no statistically significant change in force at 3 mo after MTT but showed decreases at 6 and 9 mo after MTT. At 9 mo after MTT, 23% of the 60 KE examined showed a mean increase of 65% in force; 22% showed no change; and 55% showed a mean decrease of 24% in force.

The other biceps of each patient was injected with a placebo to serve as a control. The procedure was blinded to the patients, parents, and investigators. Myoblasts derived from a biopsy specimen of the fathers were cultured and purified under strict conditions and carefully screened for microbial contamination. All patients received cyclophosphamide for immunosuppression for 6 or 12 months. No serious complications were observed after myoblast transfer, indicating that the procedure is safe. The overall therapeutic efficiency of myoblast transfer was poor as judged by the results in maximal voluntary force generation, dystrophin content of the muscle, magnetic resonance imaging of the muscle, and the lack of donor-derived DNA and dystrophin messenger RNA in the injected muscle. An improved efficiency of the take of myoblasts might be achieved by using younger cells and injecting the myoblasts with a myonecrotic agent (to increase the prevalence of regeneration) and a basal laminal fenestrating agent.",,,,1993-07-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
8450996,Mononuclear cell analysis of muscle biopsies in prednisone- and azathioprine-treated Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Neurology,"Prednisone improves strength and function in patients with Duchenne dystrophy. Although the mechanism of this effect is uncertain, prior studies suggested that the benefit might result from immunosuppressive effects on T lymphocytes invading muscle. A recent randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of prednisone and azathioprine demonstrated that azathioprine had no effect in Duchenne dystrophy, raising questions about the role of immunosuppression in mediating clinical improvement. The goal of this current study was to compare the effects of prednisone and azathioprine on mononuclear infiltrates from biopsies performed at the end of the controlled clinical trial (reported separately in the article by Griggs et al on page 520). We studied 14 patients from the prednisone group (0.75 mg/kg/d), 10 from the combination therapy group (prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/d and azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/d), and 13 from the azathioprine group (2.5 mg/kg/d), and used monoclonal antibodies for cell typing. There were no significant differences between the groups for total T cells, T-cell subsets, B cells, natural killer cells, total mononuclear cells, necrotic muscle fibers, or fibers focally invaded by mononuclear cells. These data indicate that azathioprine decreases mononuclear subsets infiltrating muscle to a similar degree as does prednisone, although azathioprine-treated patients do not show a clinical improvement. This implies that immunosuppressive actions on cellular infiltrates in muscle are probably not the primary mechanism of prednisone-induced clinical improvement.",,,,1993-03-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The present study reports a randomized, controlled trial of prednisone and azathioprine designed to assess the longer-term effects of prednisone and to determine whether azathioprine alone, or in combination with prednisone, improves strength. Ninety-nine boys (aged five to 15 years) with Duchenne dystrophy were randomized to one of three groups: (I) placebo; (II) prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/d; or (III) prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d. After 6 months, azathioprine 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/d was added in groups I and II and placebo added in group III. The study showed that the beneficial effect of prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/d) is maintained for at least 18 months and is associated with a 36% increase in muscle mass. There was weight gain, growth retardation, and other side effects. Azathioprine did not have a beneficial effect.

8143083,Results of a triple blind clinical study of myoblast transplantations without immunosuppressive treatment in young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Cell transplantation,"The effects of myoblast transplantations without an immunosuppressive treatment on muscle strength, and the formation of dystrophin-positive fibers was studied in five young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using a triple blind design. Injections of myoblasts were made into one biceps brachii (BB), and the opposite BB, used as a control, was sham-injected; the experimenters and the patient were blind to the myoblast-injected side. At the same time, myoblasts were also injected in the left tibialis anterior (TA) of these patients. The strength developed during maximal static contractions of the elbow flexor and extensor muscles was measured with a Kin-Com dynamometer. No increase in static elbow flexion torque was measured at any time from 2 mo up to 18 mo after the transplantation. One month after the transplantation, the percentage of dystrophin-positive fibers in the myoblast-injected TA ranged from 0 to 36%, while it ranged from 0 to 4% on the control side. The expression of dystrophin in these fibers, however, was generally low, and most likely less than 10% of the normal level. In the biceps brachii of both sides 6 mo after the transplantation, less than 1.5% of dystrophin-positive fibers were detected. The injections also triggered a humoral immune response of the host. Antibodies were capable of fixing the complement, and of lysing the newly formed myotubes. One of the antigens recognized by this immune response is possibly dystrophin. These results strongly suggest that myoblast transplantations, as well as gene therapy for DMD, cannot be done without immunosuppression.",,,,1993-03-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Patients undergoing tendon transfer (N = 9) had a longer operating time and two perioperative complications, but retained plantigrade posture of their feet even after walking ceased. By contrast, lengthening of the posterior tibialis tendon (N = 6) was associated with a recurrent equinovarus foot deformity that frequently interfered with shoe wear.

1523203,First-trimester biochemical and molecular diagnoses using chorionic villi: high accuracy in the U.S. collaborative study.,,Prenatal diagnosis,"The accuracy of biochemical and molecular prenatal diagnoses using chorionic villi as the fetal source was assessed by seven centres participating in the NICHD collaborative study on the safety and accuracy of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Of 601 pregnancies studied, biochemical methods were used to determine the diagnosis in 283 fetuses at risk for 35 different metabolic disorders. Fifteen different lysosomal storage diseases accounted for 81 per cent of the biochemical prenatal diagnoses performed, with 57 per cent of these pregnancies at risk for Tay-Sachs disease. No errors were made in the biochemical diagnoses that predicted affected or unaffected fetuses. However, the diagnoses of certain disorders (e.g., mucopolysacchariodosis type IH, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Krabbe disease) occasionally required confirmatory studies in cultured amniocytes because the enzyme results were inconclusive in direct and/or cultured villi or due to the presence of a pseudodeficiency allele. Of these, only the diagnosis of a fetus at risk for Krabbe disease remained inconclusive after special studies to discriminate between mutant and pseudo-deficiency alleles. Recombinant DNA techniques were used to predict the diagnosis of 318 fetuses at risk for 16 different disorders in which the defective disease gene could be detected either directly or by linkage analysis to a nearby polymorphic marker. Of these, 32 per cent were for haemoglobinopathies, 25 per cent for cystic fibrosis, 24 per cent for Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy, and 7 per cent for haemophilias. Pregnancies at risk for known disorders with specific molecular lesions (e.g., sickle cell disease) were accurately diagnosed in direct and/or cultured villi. Diagnoses requiring analyses with closely linked polymorphic markers were occasionally uniformative or inconclusive. Maternal contamination was not reported in any biochemical or molecular-based diagnosis.

Subjects were 102 boys, aged 5 to 15 years, who were participating in a double-blind, multicenter trial to document the effects of prednisone on muscle strength in patients with DMD. Four physical therapists participated in the study. Two identical (duplicate) evaluations were performed within 5 days of each other by the same examiner initially and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. A total of 18 muscle groups were tested on each patient, 16 of them bilaterally, using a modification of the Medical Research Council scale. Reliability of muscle strength grades obtained for individual muscle groups and of individual muscle strength grades was analyzed using Cohen's weighted Kappa. The reliability of grades for individual muscle groups ranged from .65 to .93, with the proximal muscles having the higher reliability values. The reliability of individual muscle strength grades ranged from .80 to .99, with those in the gravity-eliminated range scoring the highest.

The Phase II study was designed to strengthen muscles of both lower limbs. Forty-eight intramuscular injections transferred the myoblasts into 22 major muscles at 55.6 x 10(6)/mL in 10 min under general anesthesia. Eleven boys had received 8 million myoblasts each 1 yr ago in the Phase I MTT. In the Phase II study, eight of them had their myoblasts subcultured from reserves frozen 1 yr ago. The donor myoblasts for each of the remaining boys were cultured from satellite cells derived from a 1-g muscle biopsy of a normal male who might or might not be histocompatible with the recipient. The immunosuppressant cyclosporine (Cy) is being administered to recipients for 6 mo after MTT to facilitate donor cell survival. There was no evidence of an adverse reaction to MTT or Cy as determined by serial laboratory evaluations including electrolytes, creatinine, and urea. Early objective functional tests using the KinCom Robotic Dynamometer were conducted on 13 subjects aged 6 to 13 before MTT and at 3 mo after MTT. Of the 69 muscle groups (knee extensors, knee flexors, plantar flexors) tested for isometric force generation in these subjects, 43% showed mean increase of 41.3% +/- 5.9 SEM, 38% showed no change, and 19% showed continuous force reduction of 23.4% +/- 3.1 SEM. The remaining subjects await the 3-mo post-MTT evaluation. The results indicate that 1) MTT is safe; 2) MTT increases muscle strength in DMD: 81% of the muscles tested showed either increase in strength or did not show continuous loss of strength; 3) more than 5 billion myoblasts can be cultured from 1 g normal muscle biopsy, providing unprecedented numbers of cells for MTT; 4) myoblasts, frozen over 1 yr, retain the ability to proliferate from 10 million to 5 billion, and to form normal myofibers; 5) injections of 5 billion myoblasts have not provoked any immunological rejection symptoms in the Phase II subjects, 11 of whom received 8 million myoblasts in the Phase I MTT a year ago; 6) it is safe to perform multiple injections of myoblasts into lower limb muscles without formation of emboli; and 7) donor cell rejection by the recipient can be prevented with Cy when properly managed.",,,,1992-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We attempted to maintain 93 boys on that dose for an additional 2 years. During the 3 years of observation, the decline in average muscle strength scores of all boys taking prednisone was 0.072 units/yr, as compared with an expected decline of 0.341 units/yr from natural history controls. The occurrence of side effects in some boys prevented maintenance of the full dose, which may have lessened the response. At the time of last visit, dosages ranged from 0.15 mg/kg to 0.75 mg/kg. In addition to maintaining their strength, several of the boys actually improved their performance in lifting kilogram weights and in some timed function tests.

The strength and function in both prednisone-treated groups improved equally and were significantly better than in the placebo group. To compare alternate-day and daily dosing of prednisone with respect to benefits and adverse side effects, the placebo group was started on alternate-day prednisone therapy, and the treatment group regimens were changed to equivalent doses of alternate-day prednisone without breaking the double-blind nature. At the end of 6 months, the group that was changed from daily to alternate-day therapy had declined in strength back to levels observed 12 months previously, at the start of daily therapy. The group in which alternate-day therapy was started showed a significant improvement in strength at 3 months, similar in magnitude to the response of boys treated with daily therapy. However, their strength declined significantly in the subsequent 3 months compared with boys who received daily therapy. The frequency of side effects was not significantly different for alternate-day therapy compared with daily therapy. We conclude that alternate-day prednisone therapy effectively increases strength but does not sustain the improvement to the same extent as daily therapy or mitigate side effects.",,,,1991-06-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
1852156,Effect of dantrolene in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Muscle & nerve,"We have demonstrated that maneuvers capable of reducing Ca influx into cells have beneficial effects in dystrophic hamsters and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Since dantrolene inhibits Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, its effects on DMD was studied in 7 patients of 6 to 13 years of age (mean 10.8 years). Patients were studied for 4 years with tri-monthly evaluations of manual muscle testing (MMT), functional activity, and serum CK and aldolase. During the first 2-year period, no medicines were given and served as control. In the second 2-year period, dantrolene 8 mg/kg/d was administered. No side effects were observed. In 1 patient, mild weakness occurred that disappeared when the dose was reduced to 6 mg/kg/d. The 95% confidence limit for the difference in slopes of regression lines from tri-monthly MMT was asymmetric in favor of dantrolene in 5 of 7 patients. Serum CK did not differ between the first and second year of the control and treatment periods, respectively. However, it fell significantly from the second year of control to the first year of treatment (P = 0.003). The fall during the first year of treatment was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) than in age-matched natural history controls during the same length of observation. There was a 3-fold reduction in CK when the pooled values of the first and second year control vs. treatment periods were analyzed. No changes were observed in functional activity and serum aldolase.

There was a significant difference in total T cells (CD2+) between the placebo group and both treatment groups. Similarly, the number of CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T cells was significantly decreased in both treated groups compared with placebo. The number of muscle fibers focally invaded by lymphocytes was also significantly decreased in the two treated groups compared with controls. There were no differences between the low- and high-dose groups.

CIDD Study Group.,,Neurology,"The mechanism by which prednisone improves muscle strength and function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is unknown. We addressed the possibility that clinical improvement was related to prednisone-induced alterations in skeletal muscle dystrophin. We performed muscle biopsies on patients at the conclusion of a randomized, double-blind, 6-month trial of prednisone and analyzed dystrophin content using Western blots and antibody staining of tissue sections. These studies demonstrated no significant differences in dystrophin content between treatment (prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/d, n = 12; prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/d, n = 9) and placebo (n = 12) groups. Of interest, however, was the presence of varying numbers of dystrophin-positive fibers (revertants) occurring individually or in clusters in antibody-stained tissue sections of more than one-half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions half of the Duchenne patients. Mutation analysis revealed that revertants occurred in DMD patients with identifiable deletions or duplications, and in nondeletion patients. Prednisone treatment did not influence the prevalence of revertants. Revertants are most likely due to a second-site mutation occurring in a somatic cell allowing for restoration of the translational reading frame of the dystrophin transcript.",,,,1991-05-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
2012511,"Prednisone in Duchenne dystrophy. A randomized, controlled trial defining the time course and dose response. Clinical Investigation of Duchenne Dystrophy Group.",,Archives of neurology,"A randomized, controlled trial of daily prednisone was conducted in 99 boys (aged 5 to 15 years) with Duchenne dystrophy to define the time course of improvement and the dose response to treatment. Prednisone at 0.3 mg/kg (n = 33), prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg (n = 34), and placebo (n = 32) were administered for 6 months. Patients were examined using manual muscle and myometry testing, timed functional testing, pulmonary function testing, and laboratory measurements at 10 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months of treatment. Boys treated with prednisone had stronger average muscle strength scores, than did boys treated with placebo as early as 10 days after starting therapy. At the 3-month visit, the boys in the group given 0.75 mg/kg of prednisone were significantly stronger than those in the group given 0.3 mg/kg of prednisone, indicating a dose response. At 6 months, significant side effects occurred in the group treated with 0.75 mg/kg of prednisone, including weight gain, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hari growth. Only weight gain was observed in the group taking prednisone at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Importantly, no side effects were evident at 10 days or 1 month of treatment, despite improvement in muscle strength and function. We conclude that prednisone produces a rapid increase in muscle strength in patients with Duchenne dystrophy and that this improvement is maximal at a prednisone dosage of 0.75 mg/kg or less.",,,,1991-04-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
2009048,Reliability of testing measures in Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy.,,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,"In a multiinstitutional collaborative study, we ascertained the interevaluator and intraevaluator reliability of six physical therapists who performed assessment measures on 36 boys (11.7 +/- 3.9 years) with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy. Upper and lower extremities were evaluated by manual muscle testing for function, range of motion, and strength. The data were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). For the interevaluator phase, ICCs were as follows: average muscle strength, .90; range of motion, .76; and upper extremity functional performance, .58. For the intraevaluator phase, corresponding ICCs were .80 to .96; .33 to .97; .34 to 1.00. Our results confirm and extend observations by others that these assessment measures are sufficiently reliable for use in a multiinstitutional collaborative effort. Such results can be used to design clinical trials that have sufficient statistical power to detect changes in the rate of disease progression. Investigators planning clinical trials in a multiinstitutional collaborative setting should first standardize the assessment methods, provide evaluator training, and document reliability.",,,,1991-04-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The contralateral EDBs were sham-injected with carrier solution. Donor myoblasts were derived from cell culture of muscle biopsies from the normal ward or normal brothers of the recipients. Cyclosporine (CsA) treatment began two days before myoblast injection and continued for three months. Three days prior to myoblast injection and three months after, the isometric twitch and maximum voluntary contraction of the left and the right EDBs were measured. Myoblast-injected EDBs showed increases in tensions whereas sham-injected EDBs showed reductions. Both immunocytochemical staining and immunoblot revealed dystrophin in the myoblast-injected EDBs. Dystrophic characteristics such as fiber splitting, central nucleation, phagocytic necrosis, variation in fiber shape and size, and infiltration of fat and connective tissues were less frequently observed in these muscles. Sham-injected EDBs exhibited significant structural and functional degeneration and no dystrophin. Throughout the study, there was no sign of erythema, swelling or tenderness at the injection sites. Serial laboratory evaluation including electrolytes, creatinine, and urea did not reveal any significant changes before or after myoblast transfer. We conclude that myoblast transfer therapy is a safe and efficacious procedure to improve the biochemistry, structure, and function of degenerative EDB muscles in DMD.",,,,1991-04-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Myometric muscle strength measurements, Scott Score and timed tests showed statistically significant improvement for the treated group (P less than 0.05). Side-effects after 9 months of treatment included mild cushingoid appearance in four patients (28%) and moderate in only one (7%), increased appetite in seven (50%), increased body hair in four (28%), irritability and hyperactivity in three (21%). Increased body weight was not prominent and was controlled with dietary measures. No patient had to be withdrawn from medication. More research and long-term follow-up are needed in order to establish the mechanism of improvement and the consequences of long-term steroid administration in DMD.

We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups. Although mazindol-treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo-treated patients, no significant effect on IGF-I levels was observed.

2617453,Oxygen treatment of sleep hypoxaemia in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Thorax,"Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy develop progressive ventilatory muscle weakness and often die of respiratory complications. Recurrent, often profound, hypoxaemia has been shown in a previous study by this group to occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in these patients before they develop sleep symptoms. In this study the efficacy and physiological effects of nocturnal oxygen in such patients have been assessed. Seven patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (age range 16-22 years; mean vital capacity 1.37 litres) with normal arterial blood gas tensions when awake were investigated by standard overnight polysomnography on an acclimatization night followed by two successive nights on which they received room air and nasal oxygen (2 litres/min) respectively in random order. Total sleep time, proportion of REM and non-REM sleep, and frequency and duration of arousals were similar on the two nights. When breathing air six of the seven subjects developed oxygen desaturation of more than 5% during REM sleep. With oxygen only one subject showed any oxygen desaturation exceeding 2.5%. Oxygen desaturation was associated with periods of hypopnoea or cessation of respiratory effort. The mean duration of episodes of hypopnoea and apnoea was prolonged during oxygen breathing by 19% and the mean duration of episodes during REM sleep by 33% (the proportion of REM sleep associated with hypopnoea and apnoea increased in all subjects). Heart rate in non-REM sleep fell by 9.3%; heart rate variation in REM and non-REM sleep was unchanged. These acute studies show that oxygen reduces the sleep hypoxaemia associated with respiratory muscle weakness; whether long term treatment will be possible or desirable is not clear as oxygen potentiates the underlying ventilatory disturbance.",,,,1989-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Five of the six patients developed oxygen desaturation exceeding 5 percent during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep while breathing air. Minute ventilation on air (the mean of at least six consecutive minutes) was 6.9 +/- 0.7 (SEM) L min-1 but fell, owing to decreases in both tidal volume and frequency, to 4.9 +/- 0.3 L min-1 (p less than 0.05) in slow wave sleep and to 4.5 +/- 0.6 L min-1 (p less than 0.05) in REM sleep. Similar falls were seen on oxygen. The variability of all ventilatory data was significantly greater in REM than non-REM (NREM) sleep. The mean abdominal contribution to breathing was lower than predicted for wakefulness and all sleep stages, and two subjects showed paradoxical abdominal movement in NREM sleep; a correlation (p less than 0.05) existed between the NREM abdominal (diaphragmatic) contribution and the extent of oxygen desaturation subsequently seen in REM. We conclude that although awake minute ventilation is normal in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hypoventilation occurs in all sleep stages, and those with diaphragmatic dysfunction are especially vulnerable to oxygen desaturation during REM sleep.",,,,1989-12-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

The patients were assigned to one of three regimens: prednisone, 0.75 mg per kilogram of body weight per day (n = 33); prednisone, 1.5 mg per kilogram per day (n = 34); or placebo (n = 36). The groups were initially comparable in all measures of muscle function. Both prednisone groups had significant improvement of similar degree in the summary scores of muscle strength and function. Improvement began as early as one month and peaked by three months. At six months the high-dose prednisone group, as compared with the placebo group, had improvement in the time needed to rise from a supine to a standing position (3.4 vs. 6.2 seconds), to walk 9 m (7.0 vs. 9.7 seconds), and to climb four stairs (4.0 vs. 7.1 seconds), in lifting a weight (2.1 vs. 1.2 kg), and in forced vital capacity (1.7 vs. 1.5 liters) (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). There was an increase in urinary creatinine excretion (261 vs. 190 mg per 24 hours), which suggested an increase in total muscle mass. However, the prednisone-treated patients who had required long-leg braces (n = 5) or wheelchairs (n = 11) continued to require them. The most frequent side effects were weight gain, cushingoid appearance, and excessive hair growth. We conclude from this six-month study that prednisone improves the strength and function of patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.

In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study, 13 DMD patients aged from 3-10 years (mean, 7 years) were treated with 5 mg/kg diltiazem daily for 1 year. Compared with before therapy, the number of calcium-positive muscular fibres was remarkably reduced in the treated DMD patients, but not in the placebo group. The evaluation of all other biochemical and clinical parameters revealed no significant effects of the diltiazem therapy. The muscular X-ray density measured by computer tomography decreased under treatment. After the evaluation of the double-blind study, the code was broken.

The 95% confidence interval for the difference in slopes of regression lines obtained from trimonthly manual muscle tests on all subjects was markedly asymmetric in favor of the diltiazem group, but this difference was also not significant. There was less deterioration of functional activity of lower extremities in the diltiazem-treated group, when beginning and end values were analyzed (p = 0.03). However, the difference in slopes of regression lines obtained from trimonthly determinations was nonsignificant. Similarly, the beginning versus end comparisons of systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed a significantly (p less than 0.05) smaller elevation of blood pressure in the diltiazem-treated group, but no difference was observed when the slopes of all values were analyzed.

In this paper we develop a model for a total-muscle-strength score that uses the data of the extended baseline period in the evaluation of the leucine treatment. The model is based on a polynomial growth curve in age whose coefficients can vary according to treatment or phase. Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the model are obtained from use of the EM algorithm. We propose tests for the adequacy of the model as well as for treatment effects. A quadratic model appears the most parsimonious fit to the data and there is no evidence of any leucine effect on scores.

Reductions in the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) and the PCr/Pi ratios were found, but ATP as a fraction of the total mobile phosphorus signal was not reduced, and intracellular pH was normal in the Duchenne muscle. Attempts at quantitation of the NMR signal suggested that the reduced total phosphorus signal seen in the Duchenne muscle was a result of muscle fiber loss only and that the muscle fiber ATP concentration was probably normal in the diseased tissue. An exercise study in one 7-year-old boy with Duchenne's dystrophy demonstrated that the muscle had a normal ability to break down and resynthesize phosphocreatine.

A double-blind and open crossover trial on the oral administration of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to 12 patients with progressive muscular dystrophies and neurogenic atrophies was conducted. These diseases included the Duchenne, Becker, and limb-girdle dystrophies, myotonic dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Welander disease. The impaired cardiac function was noninvasively and extensively monitored by impedance cardiography. Solely by significant change or no change in stroke volume and cardiac output, all 8 patients on blind CoQ10 and all 4 on blind placebo were correctly assigned (P less than 0.003). After the limited 3-month trial, improved physical well-being was observed for 4/8 treated patients and for 0/4 placebo patients; of the latter, 3/4 improved on CoQ10; 2/8 patients resigned before crossover; 5/6 on CoQ10 in crossover maintained improved cardiac function; 1/6 crossed over from CoQ10 to placebo relapsed. The rationale of this trial was based on known mitochondrial myopathies, which involve respiratory enzymes, the known presence of CoQ10 in respiration, and prior clinical data on CoQ10 and dystrophy. These results indicate that the impaired myocardial function of such patients with muscular disease may have some association with impaired function of skeletal muscle, both of which may be improved by CoQ10 therapy. The cardiac improvement was definitely positive. The improvement in well-being was subjective, but probably real. Likely, CoQ10 does not alter genetic defects but can benefit the sequelae of mitochondrial impairment from such defects. CoQ10 is the only known substance that offers a safe and improved quality of life for such patients having muscle disease, and it is based on intrinsic bioenergetics.",,,,1985-07-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
3897804,Clinical trials of allopurinol in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,,Medical hypotheses,"A wide range of different disturbances characteristic of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be attributed to a fundamental chronic shortage of intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), in turn arising from a basic lack of total adenylate. Purine conservation by the hypoxanthine isomer allopurinol, which promotes salvage and inhibits catabolism, greatly increases muscle ATP and total adenylate, with corresponding clinical benefit. Among subsequent confirmatory clinical trials some gave positive results, while others provided no information. Reasons given why these latter proved uninformative include asking questions either irrelevant and/or incapable of being answered, not least in older boys with too much shrinking fibrous tissue infiltrating too little remaining muscle. Informative results from any metabolic intervention can be expected only where sufficient muscle is left to respond, and this age-linked effect is everywhere evident in the positive trials. Thus, if an effect of allopurinol now seems apparent, and since it is extremely safe and does not enter the genetic material, it is suggested that it be administered shortly after birth before irreversible pathological changes occur. This implies neo-natal male mass screening, easily accomplished by a simple dried-blood spot test, and already carried out successfully elsewhere.",,,,1985-06-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
16758594,The effects of inspiratory resistive training on respiratory muscle function in patients with muscular dystrophy.,,Muscle & nerve,"The effects of inspiratory resistive training on respiratory muscle function was evaluated in 11 patients with Duchenne, limb-girdle, and facio-scapulo-humeral (FSH) type muscular dystrophy. Muscle training consisted of breathing against an inspiratory resistance for two 15-minute sessions each day while at home. Following 6 weeks of training, there were significant increases in the maximum resistance that could be tolerated for at least 5 minutes (P < 0.01) and also in the maximum duration that ventilations equal to 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of the maximum voluntary ventilation could be sustained (P < 0.05). In six patients who trained for an additional 6-week period, respiratory muscle endurance increased even further. The degree of improvement in respiratory muscle endurance was positively correlated with baseline vital capacity (r = 0.84, P < 0.05) and maximal inspiratory pressure (r = 0.76, P < 0.05). Spirometry, functional residual capacity, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures were not affected by training. We conclude that inspiratory resistive training improves respiratory muscle endurance in muscular dystrophy patients. Improvement in respiratory muscle function may serve to delay the onset of respiratory complications in patients with muscular dystrophy.",,,,1985-05-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

Detailed clinical evaluation was performed trimonthly. Muscle ATP and ADP content was measured before and after 1 year of treatment. The effect of therapy on adenine nucleotide turnover was determined. No significant difference was observed between the treated and placebo groups, but both showed a significant deterioration (p less than 0.05) in most clinical parameters. Muscle ATP was reduced in Duchenne dystrophy (p less than 0.02) but did not change with therapy, and no correction of the abnormal adenine nucleotide degradation was observed.",,,,1985-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
6399927,Clinical investigation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: IV. Double-blind controlled trial of leucine.,,Muscle & nerve,"Ninety-six patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were randomized and placed either on placebo or oral leucine at a dose of 0.2 g per kg per day. Patients were evaluated using a protocol that measured muscle strength, joint contracture, functional grade and activity, and pulmonary function tests. After 1 month there was a transient but significant difference in the strength of the two groups, the treated group being stronger than the placebo group. At 6 months there was also a transient difference in joint contracture measurements. Analysis of the data showed that the difference between the groups for both these measurements could not be ascribed to a therapeutic effect of leucine but rather to an unexpected drop in the placebo group. This was recognized only because the slope of deterioration for these functions had been well documented during the natural history phase of the study. These results indicate that oral leucine failed to produce a therapeutic response over a 1-year double-blind, controlled trial.",,,,1984-09-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

This article describes the protocol for the evaluation technique and the method used to establish within (intraobserver) and between (interobserver) reliability of the protocol evaluation procedures. Standardized patient evaluations were used, and consistency of evaluation was monitored by a computer. The reliability of the measures was analyzed 1) within observers by comparing the results of each of the first three tests done by each evaluator for all patients and 2) between observers by comparing, at multicenter group meetings, the results of each of the four evaluators' tests of the same patient. We have demonstrated reliability for an evaluation method that will provide an objective foundation on which to claim a drug or therapeutic procedure does or does not have an effect in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",,,,1984-01-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv

We then did a double blind crossover study of methysergide and found an average improvement of 33% in head holding time with methysergide compared to placebo. In other tests, including grip strength, ward walking time, and Gower Time, methysergide average scores always were better than placebo average scores, but never by more than 12%, and at no time did the differences reach statistical significance.

Using double-blind techniques, this possibility was tested in 16 DMD patients by giving oral allopurinol, a synthetic inhibitor of the purine catabolic enzyme xanthine oxidase. Sublingual procaine adenylate was also briefly tested. Instances of clinical improvement quickly occurred which were statistically significant; they were accompanied by a significant increase in physical strength. These improvements have been maintained for more than 6 mo by administration of a small amount of allopurinol daily. Procaine adenylate had little effect. These results support the above view of DMD and seem to indicate that existing purines, retained and recycled after allopurinol, can sustain such improvement, and that additional adenylate is unnecessary.",,,,1978-02-01,Pubmed_Duchenne_Muscular_Dystrophy.csv
