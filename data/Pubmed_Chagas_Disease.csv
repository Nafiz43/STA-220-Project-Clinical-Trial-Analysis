40015050,"α-Cyanocinnamylboronic acid derivatives are safe, selective anti-inflammatory molecules that inhibit P2X7 receptor function and signaling.","ATP, Boron compounds, Inflammatory disease, Ionic channel, Knoevenagel, Proinflammatory cytokines, Purinergic receptor",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,"P2X7 purinergic receptor (P2X7R) is a promising target for the development of new anti-inflammatory therapies. This can be inferred from the number of pharmaceutical patents aimed at inhibitors of this receptor and the number of clinical trials related to P2X7 in progress. A previous study demonstrated that α-cyanocinnamylboronic acid derivatives can be valuable starting points for designing P2X7 inhibitors. Encouraged by previous results, new 2-cyanocinamic boronic acids were prepared and evaluated for their cytotoxicity, ability to inhibit human and mouse P2X7 receptors, and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo in ATP-induced mouse paw edema. In the present work, a series of 2-cyanocinamic boronic acids were evaluated for their effects on the function and intracellular signaling of the purinergic receptor P2X7. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory properties of the series were investigated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The selectivity and affinity for inhibiting the P2X7 receptor were investigated in U937 cells via in silico assays. We observed that 3 l inhibited P2X7 receptor function and intracellular signaling in vitro and inflammation in vivo after binding to P2X7 receptor allosteric sites.",,,,2025-02-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
39947818,Cross-sectional evaluation of host biomarkers for guiding antibiotic use in bacterial and non-bacterial acute febrile illness in low- and middle-income tropical settings.,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Malaria, Public health",BMJ open,"To evaluate the effectiveness of 18 different host biomarkers in differentiating bacterial from non-bacterial acute febrile illness (AFI) in resource-limited settings, specifically in Brazil, Malawi and Gabon.
Multinational, cross-sectional study.
The study was carried out across multiple primary healthcare facilities, including urban and rural settings, with a total of three participating centres. Recruitment took place from October 2018 to July 2019 in Brazil, May to November 2019 in Gabon and April 2017 to April 2018 in Malawi.
A total of 1915 participants, including children and adults aged 21-65 years with a fever of≤7 days, were recruited through convenience sampling from outpatient clinics in Brazil, Gabon and Malawi. Individuals with signs of severe illness were excluded. Written consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians.
This is not applicable as the study primarily focused on biomarker evaluation without specific therapeutic interventions.
The primary outcome measure was the ability of each host biomarker to differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial AFI, as evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Secondary outcomes included the performance of individual biomarkers across the different study sites and in a multivariable setting.
A Kruskal-Wallis test, adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg, was performed for each biomarker to identify covariates with a significant difference in the distribution of biomarker values. The analysis revealed that country of origin (Brazil, Gabon, Malawi), age, sex and malaria status significantly impacted biomarker distribution (p≤0.001). The most widely known biomarkers, such as white blood cell (WBC) count and C-reactive protein (CRP), demonstrated the best performance in distinguishing between bacterial and non-bacterial infections, with AUROCs reaching up to 0.83 (0.77-0.88) for WBC count and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for CRP. However, none of the evaluated novel host biomarkers exhibited high performance (AUROC<0.70 in most cases) and variations in biomarker performance were observed across the three settings. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that while the best combination of biomarkers achieved higher AUROCs, the increase was modest (1-13%), suggesting that the interaction of biomarkers contributed minimally to predictive accuracy.
There is a continued need for innovation in the host-biomarker space as the available markers do not meet the needs of diverse populations around the globe. This highlights the importance of targeted evaluations in non-severe patients in multiple settings to understand the true potential for real-life use. The findings highlight that not one-marker fits all settings and novel innovations remain urgently needed.

Antiviral treatments, such as remdesivir or molnupiravir, have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy. Nirmatrelvir, an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) major protease inhibitor, is clinically effective but has been associated with viral rebound and antiviral resistance. It is thus necessary to study novel and repurposed antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. We previously demonstrated that daclatasvir (DCV), an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein, impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting viral RNA polymerase and exonuclease, but the doses of DCV used to inhibit the new coronavirus are greater than the standard human plasma exposure for hepatitis C. Because any potential use of DCV against SARS-CoV-2 would be shorter than that reported here and short-term toxicological studies on DCV show that higher doses are tolerable, we searched for doses of DCV that could protect transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (K18-hACE-2) from lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2. We found that a dose of 60 mg/kg/day provides this protection by reducing virus replication and virus-induced lung insult. This dose is tolerable in different animal models. Taken together, our data provide preclinical evidence that can support phase I clinical trials to confirm the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of new doses of daclatasvir for a short duration in humans to further advance this compound's utility against COVID-19.",,,,2025-01-08,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
39627222,Early assessment of antibodies decline in Chagas patients following treatment using a serological multiplex immunoassay.,,Nature communications,"Chagas disease following infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is a major public health issue, with the disease spreading beyond endemic regions and becoming more global due to the migration of infected individuals. The currently available anti-parasitic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, remain insufficiently evaluated for their efficacy in adult patients. A key challenge is the lack of markers for parasitological cure, which also precludes the development of new treatments. Consequently, there is a critical need for a practical method to assess drug performance within a short timeframe. In this retrospective analysis of the phase 2 randomized controlled BENDITA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03378661), we report the potential of a serological multiplex method (MultiCruzi), combined with advanced statistical analytical methods, to measure the response to anti-parasitic treatment of adult Chagas patients. Applying this approach to serum samples from adult patients in the indeterminate chronic stage of Chagas disease, treated with different benznidazole regimens and combinations, we predict treatment efficacy after just 6 months of follow-up, in sharp contrast to data obtained with conventional and recombinant T. cruzi ELISA tests. The obtained results are also compared with the PCR data. We propose integrating MultiCruzi as a serological method endpoint in proof-of-concept clinical trials for Chagas disease.",,,,2024-12-04,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Despite results in other diseases, its effectiveness against COVID-19 remains uncertain with conflicting results in clinical trials. A pragmatic, single-center, prospective, and open randomized controlled trial was carried out in a hospital in Brazil, with the aim of evaluating the impact of convalescent plasma on the clinical improvement of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale was used to measure clinical improvement, focusing on the reduction in disease severity by up to 2 points, while antibody and C-reactive protein levels were monitored over time. After hospital admission, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive convalescent plasma and standard treatment or to be part of the control group with standard treatment. Follow-up was carried out on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and/or at discharge. From January 14 to April 4, 2022, 38 patients were included, but 3 were excluded due to protocol deviations, resulting in a total of 35 patients: 19 in the control group and 16 in the plasma group. There was no significant difference in clinical improvement between the convalescent plasma group and the control group, nor in secondary outcomes. The study had limitations due to the small number of patients and limited representation of COVID-19 cases.

39356542,Amiodarone or Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator in Chagas Cardiomyopathy: The CHAGASICS Randomized Clinical Trial.,,JAMA cardiology,"Over 10 000 people with Chagas disease experience sudden cardiac death (SCD) annually, mostly caused by ventricular fibrillation. Amiodarone hydrochloride and the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) have been empirically used to prevent SCD in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.
To test the hypothesis that ICD is more effective than amiodarone therapy for primary prevention of all-cause mortality in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy and moderate to high mortality risk, assessed by the Rassi score.
CHAGASICS is an open-label, randomized clinical trial. The study enrolled patients from 13 centers in Brazil from May 30, 2014, to August 13, 2021, with the last follow-up November 8, 2021. Patients with serological findings positive for Chagas disease, a Rassi risk score of at least 10 points (intermediate to high risk), and at least 1 episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were eligible to participate. Data were analyzed from May 3, 2022, to June 16, 2023.
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ICD or amiodarone (with a loading dose of 600 mg after randomization).
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included SCD, hospitalization for heart failure, and necessity of a pacemaker during the entire follow-up.
The study was stopped prematurely for administrative reasons, with 323 patients randomized (166 in the amiodarone group and 157 in the ICD group), rather than the intended 1100 patients. Analysis was by intention to treat at a median follow-up of 3.6 (IQR, 1.8-4.4) years. Mean (SD) age was 57.4 (9.8) years, 185 patients (57.3%) were male, and the mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction was 37.0% (11.6%). There were 60 deaths (38.2%) in the ICD arm and 64 (38.6%) in the amiodarone group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.60-1.22]; P = .40). The rates of SCD (6 [3.8%] vs 23 [13.9%]; HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.10-0.61]; P = .001), bradycardia requiring pacing (3 [1.9%] vs 27 [16.3%]; HR, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.03-0.34]; P < .001), and heart failure hospitalization (14 [8.9%] vs 28 [16.9%]; HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.24-0.87]; P = .01) were lower in the ICD group compared with the amiodarone arm.
In patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy at moderate to high risk of mortality, ICD did not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. However, ICD significantly reduced the risk of SCD, pacing need, and heart failure hospitalization compared with amiodarone therapy. Further studies are warranted to confirm the evidence generated by this trial.

Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), the most severe form of target organ involvement in Chagas disease, is characterized by a complex pathophysiology and a unique phenotype that differentiates it from other cardiomyopathies, highlighting its worse prognosis compared to other aetiologies of heart failure. The three pathophysiological mechanisms with the largest impact on this differential mortality include rapidly progressive heart failure, a high incidence of stroke, and a high burden of ventricular arrhythmias. However, despite significant advances in understanding the unique molecular circuits underlying these mechanisms, the new knowledge acquired has not been efficiently translated into specific diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this unique cardiomyopathy. The lack of dedicated clinical trials and the limited CCC-specific risk stratification tools available are evidence of this reality. This review aims to provide an updated perspective of the evidence and pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the higher mortality observed in CCC compared to other cardiomyopathies and highlight opportunities in the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of the disease.",,,,2024-09-27,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

In most cases, the available drugs are obsolete and have limitations in terms of efficacy and safety. The situation becomes even more complex when considering the low number of new chemical entities (NCEs) currently in use in advanced clinical trials for most of these diseases. Natural products (NPs) are valuable sources of hits and lead compounds with privileged scaffolds for the discovery of new bioactive molecules. Considering the relevance of biodiversity for drug discovery, a chemoinformatics analysis was conducted on a compound dataset of NPs with anti-trypanosomatid activity reported in 497 research articles from 2019 to 2024. Structures corresponding to different metabolic classes were identified, including terpenoids, benzoic acids, benzenoids, steroids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, peptides, flavonoids, polyketides, lignans, cytochalasins, and naphthoquinones.

At the data cutoff (July 13, 2021), participants had 2-5 years of follow-up (mean 3·7 years [SD 1·0], median 4·0 years [IQR 3·2-4·5]). 356 VCD cases were captured through the follow-up (128 in the vaccine group and 228 in the placebo group). Vaccine efficacy against VCD caused by any DENV serotype was 67·3% (95% CI 59·4-73·9); cases caused by DENV-3 or DENV-4 were not observed. The proportions of participants who had serious adverse events were similar between treatment groups (637 [6·2%] in the vaccine group and 395 [6·6%] in the placebo group) up until the cutoff.
A single dose of Butantan-DV was generally well tolerated and efficacious against symptomatic VCD (caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2) for a mean of 3·7 years. These findings support the continued development of Butantan-DV to prevent dengue disease in children, adolescents, and adults regardless of dengue serostatus.

Due to its high cost, we aimed to use a novel device, OxyFlush®, based on oxygenation of the preservation solution, applied during liver procurement targeting the maintenance of ATP during static cold storage (SCS).
Twenty patients were randomly assigned to the OxyFlush or control group based on a 1:1 ratio. In the OxyFlush group, the perfusion solution was oxygenated with OxyFlush® device while the control group received a non-oxygenated solution. Liver and the common bile duct (CBD) biopsies were obtained at three different time points. The first was at the beginning of the procedure, the second during organ preparation, and the third after total liver reperfusion. Biopsies were analyzed, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and histological scores of the liver parenchyma and CBD were assessed. Postoperative laboratory tests were performed.
OxyFlush® was able to maintain ATP levels during SCS and improved the damage caused by the lack of oxygen in the CBD. However, OxyFlush® did not affect laboratory test results and histological findings of the parenchyma.
We present a novel low-cost device that is feasible and could represent a valuable tool in organ preservation during SCS.",,"OxyFlush® was able to maintain ATP levels during SCS and improved the damage caused by the lack of oxygen in the CBD.

Triazoles like ravuconazole (RAV) and posaconazole (POS) progressed to clinical trials. Unexpectedly, their efficacy was transient in chronic Chagas disease patients, and their activity was not superior to benznidazole (BZ) treatment. This paper aims to summarize evidence on the global activity of CYP51 inhibitors against T. cruzi by applying systematic review strategies, risk of bias assessment, and meta-analysis from in vivo studies. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for original articles, obtaining fifty-six relevant papers meeting inclusion criteria. Characteristics of animal models, parasite strain, treatment schemes, and cure rates were extracted. Primary outcomes such as maximum parasitaemia values, survival, and parasitological cure were recorded for meta-analysis, when possible. The risk of bias was uncertain in most studies. Animals treated with itraconazole, RAV, or POS survived significantly longer than the infected non-treated groups (RR = 4.85 [3.62, 6.49], P < 0.00001), and they showed no differences with animals treated with positive control drugs (RR = 1.01 [0.98, 1.04], P = 0.54). Furthermore, the overall analysis showed that RAV or POS was not likely to achieve parasitological cure when compared with BZ or NFX treatment (OD = 0.49 [0.31, 0.77], P = 0.002). This systematic review contributes to understanding why the azoles had failed in clinical trials and, more importantly, how to improve the animal models of T. cruzi infection by filling the gaps between basic, translational, and clinical research.",,,,2024-06-21,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
38820119,Effect of Smoking on Longitudinal Interferon γ Release Assay Results Among Close Contacts of People with Pulmonary Tuberculosis.,"IGRA, close contacts, interferon γ release assays, smoking, tuberculosis",The Journal of infectious diseases,"Diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in close contacts is critical for tuberculosis control. Smoking is a risk factor for M. tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease but its effect on longitudinal interferon γ release assay (IGRA) results remains unknown. We conducted a multisite prospective study in Brazil between 2015 and 2019, among close contacts of adults with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. IGRA was performed at baseline, at month 6 if results were negative at baseline, and at months 24-30 after enrollment. IGRA results were categorized as IGRA positive (maintained from baseline to the last visit), IGRA conversion (from negative to positive at any time), IGRA reversion (from positive to negative at any time), and IGRA negative (maintained from baseline to the last visit). Associations between IGRA results and smoking status at baseline (current/former vs never) in contacts were evaluated using propensity score-adjusted logistic regression models. Estimated propensity score was used as a covariate in models, which regressed the outcome (IGRA positive, IGRA conversion, IGRA reversion) on smoking status. Of 430 close contacts, 89 (21%) were IGRA positive, 30 (7%) were converters, 30 (7%) were reverters and 22 were indeterminate. Smoking frequency was 26 (29%) among IGRA-positive contacts, 7 (23%) in converters, and 3 (10%) in reverters. Smoking in contacts was associated with lower odds of IGRA reversion (adjusted odds ratio, 0.16 [95% confidence interval, .03-.70]). We did not detect associations between smoking and IGRA positive or IGRA conversion. Our findings highlight the importance of smoking on longitudinal IGRA results. This has implications for clinical care and clinical trials in which IGRA status is monitored or used as an outcome.",,,,2024-05-31,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
38806090,Tackling the challenges of human Chagas disease: A comprehensive review of treatment strategies in the chronic phase and emerging therapeutic approaches.,"Chagas disease, Clinical trials, Etiologic treatment, Trypanocidal drug, Trypanosoma cruzi",Acta tropica,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), affects approximately 7 million people worldwide and is endemic in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Since the 1960s, only two drugs have been commercially available for treating this illness: nifurtimox (NFX) and benznidazole (BZN). Although these drugs are effective in the acute phase (AP) of the disease, in which parasitemia is usually high, their cure rates in the chronic phase (CP) are low and often associated with several side effects. The CP is characterized by a subpatent parasitaemia and absence of clinical symptoms in the great majority of infected individuals. However, at least 30 % of the individuals will develop potentially lethal symptomatic forms, including cardiac and digestive manifestations. For such reason, in the CP the treatment is usually symptomatic and typically focuses on managing complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or digestive problems. Therefore, the need for new drugs or therapeutic approaches using BZN or NFX is extremely urgent. This review presents the main clinical trials, especially in the CP, which involve BZN and NFX in different treatment regimens. Additionally, other therapies using combinations of these drugs with other substances such as allopurinol, itraconazole, ravuconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and amiodarone are also reported. The importance of early diagnosis, especially in pediatric patients, is also discussed, emphasizing the need to identify the disease in its early stages to improve the chances of successful treatment.",,,,2024-05-29,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
38798659,Small molecule biomarkers predictive of Chagas disease progression.,,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,"Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. However, only 20% to 30% of infected individuals will progress to severe symptomatic cardiac manifestations. Current treatments are benznidazole and nifurtimox, which are poorly tolerated regimens. Developing a biomarker to determine the likelihood of patient progression would be helpful for doctors to optimize patient treatment strategies. Such a biomarker would also benefit drug discovery efforts and clinical trials. In this study, we combined untargeted and targeted metabolomics to compare serum samples from T. cruzi-infected individuals who progressed to severe cardiac disease, versus infected individuals who remained at the same disease stage (non-progressors). We identified four unannotated biomarker candidates, which were validated in an independent cohort using both untargeted and targeted analysis techniques. Overall, our findings demonstrate that serum small molecules can predict CD progression, offering potential for clinical monitoring.",,,,2024-05-27,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

To characterize VL at COVID-19 diagnosis among previously uninfected and unvaccinated individuals by evaluating the association of demographic and clinical characteristics, viral variant, and trial with VL, as well as the ability of VL to predict severe disease.
This secondary cross-protocol analysis used individual-level data from placebo recipients from 4 harmonized, phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials sponsored by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax. Participants were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline and acquired COVID-19 during the blinded phase of the trials. The setting included the US, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Mexico; start dates were July 27, 2020, to December 27, 2020; data cutoff dates were March 26, 2021, to July 30, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2022 to June 2023.
Linear regression was used to assess the association of demographic and clinical characteristics, viral variant, and trial with polymerase chain reaction-measured log10 VL in nasal and/or nasopharyngeal swabs taken at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis.
Among 1667 participants studied (886 [53.1%] male; 995 [59.7%] enrolled in the US; mean [SD] age, 46.7 [14.7] years; 204 [12.2%] aged 65 years or older; 196 [11.8%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 150 [9%] Black or African American, 1112 [66.7%] White; 762 [45.7%] Hispanic or Latino), median (IQR) log10 VL at diagnosis was 6.18 (4.66-7.12) log10 copies/mL.

In the Janssen study, which captured the largest number of COVID-19 events and variants and used the most intensive post-COVID surveillance, neither VL at diagnosis nor averaged over days 1 to 28 post diagnosis was associated with COVID-19 severity.
In this study of placebo recipients from 4 randomized phase 3 trials, high variability was observed in SARS-CoV-2 VL at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and only a fraction was explained by individual participant characteristics or viral variant.

Infectious diseases,"The current tuberculosis (TB) drug development pipeline is being re-populated with candidates, including nitroimidazoles such as pretomanid, that exhibit a potential to shorten TB therapy by exerting a bactericidal effect on non-replicating bacilli. Based on results from preclinical and early clinical studies, a four-drug combination of bedaquiline, pretomanid, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide (BPaMZ) regimen was identified with treatment-shortening potential for both drug-susceptible (DS) and drug-resistant (DR) TB. This trial aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of BPaMZ. We compared 4 months of BPaMZ to the standard 6 months of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) in DS-TB. 6 months of BPaMZ was assessed in DR-TB.
SimpliciTB was a partially randomised, phase 2c, open-label, clinical trial, recruiting participants at 26 sites in eight countries. Participants aged 18 years or older with pulmonary TB who were sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli were eligible for enrolment. Participants with DS-TB had Mycobacterium tuberculosis with sensitivity to rifampicin and isoniazid. Participants with DR-TB had M tuberculosis with resistance to rifampicin, isoniazid, or both. Participants with DS-TB were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by HIV status and cavitation on chest radiograph, using balanced block randomisation with a fixed block size of four. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to sputum culture-negative status by 8 weeks; the key secondary endpoint was unfavourable outcome at week 52. A non-inferiority margin of 12% was chosen for the key secondary outcome. Safety and tolerability outcomes are presented as descriptive analyses. The efficacy analysis population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication and who had efficacy data available and had no major protocol violations. The safety population contained patients who received at least one dose of medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03338621) and is completed.
Between July 30, 2018, and March 2, 2020, 455 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. 324 (71%) participants were male and 131 (29%) participants were female. 303 participants with DS-TB were randomly assigned to 4 months of BPaMZ (n=150) or HRZE (n=153). In a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis, by week 8, 122 (84%) of 145 and 70 (47%) of 148 participants were culture-negative on 4 months of BPaMZ and HRZE, respectively, with a hazard ratio for earlier negative status of 2·93 (95% CI 2·17-3·96; p<0·0001). Median time to negative culture (TTN) was 6 weeks (IQR 4-8) on 4 months of BPaMZ and 11 weeks (6-12) on HRZE. 86% of participants with DR-TB receiving 6 months of BPaMZ (n=152) reached culture-negative status by week 8, with a median TTN of 5 weeks (IQR 3-7). At week 52, 120 (83%) of 144, 134 (93%) of 144, and 111 (83%) of 133 on 4 months of BPaMZ, HRZE, and 6 months of BPaMZ had favourable outcomes, respectively. Despite bacteriological efficacy, 4 months of BPaMZ did not meet the non-inferiority margin for the key secondary endpoint in the pre-defined mITT population due to higher withdrawal rates for adverse hepatic events. Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the per-protocol population confirming the effect of withdrawals with 4 months of BPaMZ. At least one liver-related treatment-emergent adverse effect (TEAE) occurred among 45 (30%) participants on 4 months of BPaMZ, 38 (25%) on HRZE, and 33 (22%) on 6 months of BPaMZ. Serious liver-related TEAEs were reported by 20 participants overall; 11 (7%) among those on 4 months of BPaMZ, one (1%) on HRZE, and eight (5%) on 6 months of BPaMZ. The most common reasons for discontinuation of trial treatment were hepatotoxicity (ten participants [2%]), increased hepatic enzymes (nine participants [2%]), QTcF prolongation (three participants [1%]), and hypersensitivity (two participants [<1%]).
For DS-TB, BPaMZ successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint of sputum culture conversion. The regimen did not meet the key secondary efficacy endpoint due to adverse events resulting in treatment withdrawal. Our study demonstrated the potential for treatment-shortening efficacy of the BPaMZ regimen for DS-TB and DR-TB, providing clinical validation of a murine model widely used to identify such regimens. It also highlights that novel, treatment-shortening TB treatment regimens require an acceptable toxicity and tolerability profile with minimal monitoring in low-resource and high-burden settings. The increased risk of unpredictable severe hepatic adverse events with 4 months of BPaMZ would be a considerable obstacle to implementation of this regimen in settings with high burdens of TB with limited infrastructure for close surveillance of liver biochemistry. Future research should focus on improving the preclinical and early clinical detection and mitigation of safety issues together and further efforts to optimise shorter treatments.

This condition is also one of the most dreaded postoperative complications of orthognathic surgery, with severe cartilage erosion and loss of subchondral bone volume and mineral density, associated with a painful or not inflammatory processes. Because regenerative medicine has emerged as an alternative for orthopedic cases with advanced degenerative joint disease, we conducted a phase I/IIa clinical trial (U1111-1194-6997) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous nasal septal chondroprogenitor cells. Ten participants underwent biopsy of the nasal septum cartilage during their orthognathic surgery. The harvested cells were cultured in vitro and analyzed for viability, presence of phenotype markers for mesenchymal stem and/or chondroprogenitor cells, and the potential to differentiate into chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts. After the intra-articular injection of the cell therapy, clinical follow-up was performed using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) and computed tomography (CT) images. No serious adverse events related to the cell therapy injection were observed during the 12-month follow-up period. It was found that autologous chondroprogenitors reduced arthralgia, promoted stabilization of mandibular function and condylar volume, and regeneration of condylar tissues.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry a range of biological cargoes, which may be used as biomarkers of disease state.
An exploratory secondary analysis of the SARITA-2 and SARITA-1 datasets (randomized clinical trials on patients with mild and moderate/severe COVID-19) was performed. Serum-derived EVs were used for proteomic analysis to identify enriched biological processes and key proteins, thus providing insights into differences in disease severity. Serum-derived EVs were separated from patients with COVID-19 by size exclusion chromatography and nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine particle concentration and diameter. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed to identify and quantify protein signatures. Bioinformatics and multivariate statistical analysis were applied to distinguish candidate proteins associated with disease severity (mild versus moderate/severe COVID-19).
No differences were observed in terms of the concentration and diameter of enriched EVs between mild (n = 14) and moderate/severe (n = 30) COVID-19. A total of 414 proteins were found to be present in EVs, of which 360 were shared while 48 were uniquely present in severe/moderate compared to mild COVID-19. The main biological signatures in moderate/severe COVID-19 were associated with platelet degranulation, exocytosis, complement activation, immune effector activation, and humoral immune response. Von Willebrand factor, serum amyloid A-2 protein, histone H4 and H2A type 2-C, and fibrinogen β-chain were the most differentially expressed proteins between severity groups.

However, no studies report the benefits of curcumin in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study aims to evaluate the effects of curcuminoid supplementation on oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and uremic toxins originating from gut microbiota in patients with CKD undergoing PD.
This longitudinal, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated 48 patients who were randomized into two groups: Curcumin (three capsules of 500 mg of Curcuma longa extract, with 98.42 % total curcuminoids) or placebo (three capsules of 500 mg of starch) for twelve weeks. In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the transcriptional expression levels of Nrf2, HOX-1 and NF-κB were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Oxidative stress was evaluated by malondialdehyde (MDA) and total Thiol (T-SH). TNF-α and IL-6 plasma levels were measured by ELISA. P-cresyl sulphate plasma level, a uremic toxin, was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detection.
Twenty-four patients finished the study: 10 in the curcumin group (57.5 ± 11.6 years) and 14 in the placebo group (56.5 ± 10.0 years). The plasma levels of MDA were reduced after 12 weeks in the curcumin group (p = 0.01), while the placebo group remained unchanged. However, regarding the difference between the groups at the endpoint, no change was observed in MDA. Still, there was a trend to reduce the p-CS plasma levels in the curcumin group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.07).

Infectious diseases,"Treatment with benznidazole for chronic Chagas disease is associated with low cure rates and substantial toxicity. We aimed to compare the parasitological efficacy and safety of 3 different benznidazole regimens in adult patients with chronic Chagas disease.
The MULTIBENZ trial was an international, randomised, double-blind, phase 2b trial performed in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Spain. We included participants aged 18 years and older diagnosed with Chagas disease with two different serological tests and detectable T cruzi DNA by qPCR in blood. Previously treated people, pregnant women, and people with severe cardiac forms were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1, using a balanced block randomisation scheme stratified by country, to receive benznidazole at three different doses: 300 mg/day for 60 days (control group), 150 mg/day for 60 days (low dose group), or 400 mg/day for 15 days (short treatment group). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a sustained parasitological negativity by qPCR during a follow-up period of 12 months. The primary safety outcome was the proportion of people who permanently discontinued the treatment. Both primary efficacy analysis and primary safety analysis were done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with EudraCT, 2016-003789-21, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03191162, and is completed.
From April 20, 2017, to Sept 20, 2020, 245 people were enrolled, and 234 were randomly assigned: 78 to the control group, 77 to the low dose group, and 79 to the short treatment group. Sustained parasitological negativity was observed in 42 (54%) of 78 participants in the control group, 47 (61%) of 77 in the low dose group, and 46 (58%) of 79 in the short treatment group. Odds ratios were 1·41 (95% CI 0·69-2·88; p=0·34) when comparing the low dose and control groups and 1·23 (0·61-2·50; p=0·55) when comparing short treatment and control groups. 177 participants (76%) had an adverse event: 62 (79%) in the control group, 56 (73%) in the low dose group, and 59 (77%) in the short treatment group. However, discontinuations were less frequent in the short treatment group compared with the control group (2 [2%] vs 11 [14%]; OR 0·20, 95% CI 0·04-0·95; p=0·044).
Participants had a similar parasitological responses. However, reducing the usual treatment from 8 weeks to 2 weeks might maintain the same response while facilitating adherence and increasing treatment coverage. These findings should be confirmed in a phase 3 clinical trial.

Infectious diseases,"More than six million people worldwide, particularly in vulnerable communities in Latin America, are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Only a small portion have access to diagnosis and treatment. Both drugs used to treat this chronic, neglected infection, benznidazole and nifurtimox, were developed more than 50 years ago, and adverse drug reactions during treatment pose a major barrier, causing 20% of patients to discontinue therapy. Fexinidazole proved efficacious in an earlier, interrupted clinical trial, but the doses evaluated were not well tolerated. The present study evaluated fexinidazole at lower doses and for shorter treatment durations.
In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial, we included adult patients (18-60 years old) with confirmed T cruzi infection by serology and PCR and without signs of organ involvement. We evaluated three regimens of fexinidazole-600 mg once daily for 10 days (6·0 g total dose), 1200 mg daily for 3 days (3·6 g), and 600 mg daily for 3 days followed by 1200 mg daily for 4 days (6·6 g)-and compared them with a historical placebo control group (n=47). The primary endpoint was sustained negative results by PCR at end of treatment and on each visit up to four months of follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03587766, and EudraCT, 2016-004905-15.
Between Oct 16, 2017, and Aug 7, 2018, we enrolled 45 patients (n=15 for each group), of whom 43 completed the study. Eight (19%) of 43 fexinidazole-treated patients reached the primary endpoint, compared with six (13%) of 46 in the historical control group. Mean parasite load decreased sharply following treatment but rebounded beginning 10 weeks after treatment. Five participants had seven grade 3 adverse events: carpal tunnel, sciatica, device infection, pneumonia, staphylococcal infection, and joint and device dislocation. Two participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events unrelated to fexinidazole.
The fexinidazole regimens in this study had an acceptable safety profile but did not prove effective against T cruzi infection. Development of fexinidazole monotherapy for treating T cruzi infection has been stopped.

To evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist in the clinical management of brain-dead potential donors in the intensive care unit (ICU).
The Donation Network to Optimize Organ Recovery Study (DONORS) was an open-label, parallel-group cluster randomized clinical trial in Brazil. Enrollment and follow-up were conducted from June 20, 2017, to November 30, 2019. Hospital ICUs that reported 10 or more brain deaths in the previous 2 years were included. Consecutive brain-dead potential donors in the ICU aged 14 to 90 years with a condition consistent with brain death after the first clinical examination were enrolled. Participants were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. The intention-to-treat data analysis was conducted from June 15 to August 30, 2020.
Hospital staff in the intervention group were instructed to administer to brain-dead potential donors in the intervention group an evidence-based checklist with 13 clinical goals and 14 corresponding actions to guide care, every 6 hours, from study enrollment to organ retrieval. The control group provided or received usual care.
The primary outcome was loss of brain-dead potential donors to cardiac arrest at the individual level. A prespecified sensitivity analysis assessed the effect of adherence to the checklist in the intervention group.
Among the 1771 brain-dead potential donors screened in 63 hospitals, 1535 were included. These patients included 673 males (59.2%) and had a median (IQR) age of 51 (36.3-62.0) years. The main cause of brain injury was stroke (877 [57.1%]), followed by trauma (485 [31.6%]). Of the 63 hospitals, 31 (49.2%) were assigned to the intervention group (743 [48.4%] brain-dead potential donors) and 32 (50.8%) to the control group (792 [51.6%] brain-dead potential donors). Seventy potential donors (9.4%) at intervention hospitals and 117 (14.8%) at control hospitals met the primary outcome (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.08; P = .11). The primary outcome rate was lower in those with adherence higher than 79.0% than in the control group (5.3% vs 14.8%; RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.78; P = .006).
This cluster randomized clinical trial was inconclusive in determining whether the overall use of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist reduced brain-dead potential donor loss to cardiac arrest. The findings suggest that use of such a checklist has limited effectiveness without adherence to the actions recommended in this checklist.

However, literature in this field is still scarce. This review aimed to map and summarize the evidence regarding IMS in patients with CC. The inclusion criteria included reports with adult participants with a CC diagnosis, with or without heart failure (HF). The core concept examined was the maximum inspiratory pressure evaluated in the untrained and trained groups in the pre-training period. The context was open, including but not limited to hospitals and health centers. Two authors independently identified eligible studies and extracted the data. Descriptive synthesis was used as the primary strategy for analyzing the results. Nine studies (five clinical trials, three cross-sectional, and one cohort) were included. The CC classification differed among the studies, with no mention of HF in five and no CC staging specification in six. IMS was assessed using a manovacuometer, and only six studies analyzed and interpreted the data concerning the predicted values. The CC population with HF appeared to have impaired IMS. All studies involved only Brazilian volunteers. In conclusion, randomized clinical trials evaluating IMS and the effects of inspiratory muscle training need to be conducted to better understand the prevalence and risk of inspiratory muscle weakness in the CC population, as well as the effects of training. Such studies should be conducted at different stages of CC in different populations and countries.",,,,2023-12-13,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

37863671,Vaccine value profile for Hookworm.,"Feasibility, Hookworm, Vaccine, Value",Vaccine,"Hookworm, a parasitic infection, retains a considerable burden of disease, affecting the most underprivileged segments of the general population in endemic countries and remains one of the leading causes of mild to severe anemia in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), particularly in pregnancy and children under 5. Despite repeated large scale Preventive Chemotherapy (PC) interventions since more than 3 decades, there is broad consensus among scholars that elimination targets set in the newly launched NTD roadmap will require additional tools and interventions. Development of a vaccine could constitute a promising expansion of the existing arsenal against hookworm. Therefore, we have evaluated the biological and implementation feasibility of the vaccine development as well as the added value of such a novel tool. Based on pipeline landscaping and the current knowledge on key biological aspects of the pathogen and its interactions with the host, we found biological feasibility of development of a hookworm vaccine to be moderate. Also, our analysis on manufacturing and regulatory issues as well as potential uptake yielded moderate implementation feasibility. Modelling studies suggest a that introduction of a vaccine in parallel with ongoing integrated interventions (PC, WASH, shoe campaigns), could substantially reduce burden of disease in a cost - saving mode. Finally a set of actions are recommended that might impact positively the likelihood of timely development and introduction of a hookworm vaccine.",,,,2023-10-21,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

37792740,Integration of serial self-testing for COVID-19 as part of contact tracing in the Brazilian public health system: A pragmatic trial protocol.,,PloS one,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented public health crisis. Insufficient testing continues to limit the effectiveness of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Molecular testing methods such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) continue to be highly centralized and are a sub-optimal option for population surveillance. Rapid antigen tests (Ag-RDTs) offer multiple benefits including low costs, high flexibility to conduct tests in a wide variety of settings, and faster return of results. Self-test Ag-RDTs (STs) have gained approval in several markets and offer the possibility to expand testing, reaching at-risk populations. While STs have the potential to assist the COVID-19 response, test result integrity, reporting, and appropriate linkage to care continue to hinder the widespread implementation of self-testing programs. This protocol presents a mixed-methods pragmatic trial (ISRCTN91602092) to better understand the feasibility of self-testing as part of a contact tracing strategy within the Brazilian public health system. Approximately 604 close contacts of 150 index cases testing positive for COVID-19 will be enrolled. Index cases will be randomized for their close contacts to participate in either serial (daily) self-testing over a 10-day follow-up period or a more traditional approach to contact tracing with a professional Ag-RDT at one time point post-exposure. Usability workshops and focus group discussions will also be conducted. This study protocol presents a comprehensive plan to assess the effectiveness, operational feasibility, and stakeholder preferences of a serial self-testing strategy for contact tracing within the Brazilian public health system. Our results will contribute to better understanding of the feasibility of a self-testing strategy within the public sector. Potential risks and limitations are discussed. Our findings will have important implications as governments continue working to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, particularly in the context of where to direct limited resources for testing and healthcare infrastructure.

HIV,"The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 trial showed that long-acting injectable cabotegravir was more effective than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine in preventing HIV in cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men. We aimed to characterise the cohort of transgender women included in HPTN 083.
HPTN 083 is an ongoing, phase 2b/3, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial done at 43 sites in seven countries (Argentina, Brazil, Peru, the USA, South Africa, Thailand, and Viet Nam). HIV-negative participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive injectable cabotegravir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine. The study design and primary outcomes of the blinded phase of HPTN 083 have already been reported. An enrolment minimum of 10% transgender women was set for the trial. Here we characterise the cohort of transgender women enrolled from Dec 6, 2016, to May 14, 2020, when the study was unblinded. We report sociodemographic characteristics, use of gender affirming hormone therapy, and behavioural assessments of the transgender women participants. Laboratory testing and safety evaluations are also reported. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02720094.
HPTN 083 enrolled 570 transgender women (304 tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine; 266 injectable cabotegravir). Transgender women were primarily from Asia (225 [39%]) and Latin America (205 [36%]); 330 (58%) reported using gender affirming hormone therapy. Intimate partner violence was common (270 [47%] reported emotional abuse and 172 [30%] reported physical abuse) and 323 (57%) reported a history of childhood sexual abuse. 159 (28%) transgender women disagreed that they were at risk for HIV, and 142 (25%) screened positive for depressive symptoms. During study follow-up, incidence of syphilis was 16·25% (95% CI 13·28-19·69), rectal gonorrhoea was 11·66% (9·14-14·66), and chlamydia was 20·61% (17·20-24·49). Frequency of adverse events was similar between the treatment groups. Nine seroconversions occurred among transgender women during the blinded phase of the study (seven in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine group and two in the injectable cabotegravir group); overall incidence was 1·19 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0·54-2·25): 1·80 per 100 person-years (0·73-3·72) in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine group and 0·54 per 100 person-years (0·07-1·95) in the injectable cabotegravir group (hazard ratio 0·34 [95% CI 0·08-1·56]). Cabotegravir concentrations did not differ by gender affirming hormone therapy use.
HIV prevention strategies for transgender women cannot be addressed separately from social and structural vulnerabilities. Transgender women were well represented in HPTN 083 and should continue to be prioritised in HIV prevention studies. Our results suggest that injectable cabotegravir is a safe and effective pre-exposure prophylaxis option for transgender women.

Clinical trials are underway to improve treatment using new drugs or different regimens, and Real-Time PCR is used to assess the parasitological response as a surrogate biomarker. However, PCR-based strategies have limitations due to the complex nature of T. cruzi infection. The parasite exhibits asynchronous replication, different strains and clones, and diverse tissue tropism, making it challenging to determine optimal timeline points for monitoring treatment response. This mini-review explores factors that affect PCR-based monitoring and summarizes the endpoints used in clinical trials for detecting treatment failure.

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) may modulate the concentration of microRNAs (miRNAs) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21, which have been identified as non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis. The present study aims to evaluate whether n-3 PUFA supplementation can modulate miRNA-122 and FGF-21 and improve liver fibrosis and steatosis, measured by transient hepatic elastography (THE), in individuals with NAFLD.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted to evaluate the effect of 4 g/day supplementation of fish oil (2100 mg EPA and 924 mg DHA) in patients with NAFLD over a 6-month period.

Individual patient data from US government-supported harmonized vaccine trials provide an unprecedented sample population to address this issue. We characterized the protective efficacy of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and hybrid immunity against COVID-19 early in the pandemic over three-to six-month follow-up and compared with vaccine-associated protection.
In this post-hoc cross-protocol analysis of the Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, we allocated participants into four groups based on previous-infection status at enrolment and treatment: no previous infection/placebo; previous infection/placebo; no previous infection/vaccine; and previous infection/vaccine. The main outcome was RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 >7-15 days (per original protocols) after final study injection. We calculated crude and adjusted efficacy measures.
Previous infection/placebo participants had a 92% decreased risk of future COVID-19 compared to no previous infection/placebo participants (overall hazard ratio [HR] ratio: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.05-0.13). Among single-dose Janssen participants, hybrid immunity conferred greater protection than vaccine alone (HR: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01-0.10). Too few infections were observed to draw statistical inferences comparing hybrid immunity to vaccine alone for other trials. Vaccination, previous infection, and hybrid immunity all provided near-complete protection against severe disease.
Previous infection, any hybrid immunity, and two-dose vaccination all provided substantial protection against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 through the early Delta period. Thus, as a surrogate for natural infection, vaccination remains the safest approach to protection.

VE against symptomatic COVID-19 showed little heterogeneity across baseline socio-demographic, clinical or exposure characteristics, in either univariate or multivariate analysis, regardless of vaccine platform. Similarly, VE against severe COVID-19 in the single trial (Janssen) with sufficient endpoints for analysis showed little evidence of heterogeneity. COVID-19 VE is not influenced by baseline host or exposure characteristics across efficacy trials of different vaccine platforms and countries when well matched to circulating virus strains.

In both treatment groups, the number of patients with negative ELISA F29 values increased over the period of observation. The incidence rate of negative seroconversion using ELISA F29 was 22.94% (95% CI: 19.65%, 26.63%) in the 60-day treatment group and 21.64% (95% CI: 17.21%, 26.86%) in the 30-day treatment group. In the subpopulation of patients who tested seropositive for F29 before nifurtimox treatment, 88 patients (67.7%) in the 60-day regimen and 39 patients (59.1%) in the 30-day regimen were F29 seronegative at 4 years post-treatment. All patients who had a positive ELISA F29 test at baseline and seroconverted to negative measured by conventional serology reached seronegativity in ELISA F29 earlier than in conventional serology.
The results demonstrate a serological response to treatment with nifurtimox measured by the ELISA F29 test in children diagnosed with Chagas disease. The F29-based ELISA can be considered a potential early marker of response to antitrypanosomal therapy for Chagas disease.

Although significant progress has been made in understanding the underlying pathologic mechanisms of severe respiratory diseases, most therapies are supportive, aiming to mitigate symptoms and slow down their progressive course but cannot improve lung function or reverse tissue remodeling. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are at the forefront of the regenerative medicine field due to their unique biomedical potential in promoting immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antimicrobial activities, and tissue repair in various experimental models. However, despite several years of preclinical research on MSCs, therapeutic outcomes have fallen far short in early-stage clinical trials for respiratory diseases. This limited efficacy has been associated with several factors, such as reduced MSC homing, survival, and infusion in the late course of lung disease. Accordingly, genetic engineering and preconditioning methods have emerged as functional enhancement strategies to potentiate the therapeutic actions of MSCs and thus achieve better clinical outcomes. This narrative review describes various strategies that have been investigated in the experimental setting to functionally potentiate the therapeutic properties of MSCs for respiratory diseases. These include changes in culture conditions, exposure of MSCs to inflammatory environments, pharmacological agents or other substances, and genetic manipulation for enhanced and sustained expression of genes of interest.

Ongoing clinical trials are also presented.
Experimental evidence has shown that MSCs have immunomodulatory and regenerative properties that could rescue impaired lung function and histoarchitecture. Their beneficial effects have been mainly associated with their ability to communicate with target cells through the secretion of soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles or even through transfer of organelles (e.g. mitochondria). MSC-derived conditioned medium, extracellular vesicles and mitochondria induce beneficial effects in selected scenarios.

As SARS-CoV-2 spread across the globe and its impact became evident, the development of safe and effective vaccines became a priority. Outlining the processes used to establish and support the conduct of the phase 3 randomized clinical trials that led to the rapid emergency use authorization and approval of several COVID-19 vaccines is of major significance for current and future pandemic response efforts.
To support the rapid development of vaccines for the US population and the rest of the world, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases established the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN) to assist in the coordination and implementation of phase 3 efficacy trials for COVID-19 vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies. By bringing together multiple networks, CoVPN was able to draw on existing clinical and laboratory infrastructure, community partnerships, and research expertise to quickly pivot clinical trial sites to conduct COVID-19 vaccine trials as soon as the investigational products were ready for phase 3 testing. The mission of CoVPN was to operationalize phase 3 vaccine trials using harmonized protocols, laboratory assays, and a single data and safety monitoring board to oversee the various studies. These trials, while staggered in time of initiation, overlapped in time and course of conduct and ultimately led to the successful completion of multiple studies and US Food and Drug Administration-licensed or -authorized vaccines, the first of which was available to the public less than 1 year from the discovery of the virus.

CD, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, afflicts 7 million people in Latin America, and its incidence is increasing in non-endemic countries due to migration. The cardiac involvement is explained by parasite-dependent, immune-mediated myocardial injury, microvascular abnormalities, and ischemia. Current treatment of early CD includes the administration of nifurtimox and benznidazole. However, their efficacy is low in the chronic phase and may induce severe adverse events, forcing therapy to halt. Therefore, finding innovative approaches to treat this life-threatening tropical disease is of utmost importance. Thus, improving the efficacy of the current antichagasic drugs by modifying the inflammatory response would render the current treatment more effective. It has been reported that, in mice, simvastatin decreases cardiac inflammation and endothelial activation, and improves cardiac function, effects that require clinical confirmation.
The study aims to analyze whether two doses of Atorvastatin, administered after CD treatment is completed, are safe and more efficacious than the antiparasitic drugs alone in reducing general inflammation and improving endothelial and cardiac functions in a proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled phase II trial.
300 subjects will be recruited from four Chilean hospitals with an active Program for the Control of Chagas Disease. 40 or 80 mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo will be administered after completion of the antichagasic therapy. The patients will be followed up for 12 months. Efficacy will be determined by measuring changes in plasma levels of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines, soluble cell adhesion molecules, BNP, and cTnT. Also, the resting 12-lead ECG and a 2D-echocardiogram will be obtained to evaluate cardiac function.

The evaluation of therapeutic responses to available and new compounds is based on parasite detection in the bloodstream but remains challenging because a substantial proportion of infected individuals have undetectable parasitemia even when using diagnostic tools with the highest accuracy. We characterize parasite dynamics which might impact drug efficacy assessments in chronic Chagas by analyzing pre- and post-treatment quantitative-PCR data obtained from blood samples collected regularly over a year. We show that parasitemia remains at a steady-state independently of the diagnostic sensitivity. This steady-state can be probabilistically quantified and robustly predicted at an individual level. Furthermore, individuals can be assigned to categories with distinct parasitological status, allowing a more detailed evaluation of the efficacy outcomes and adjustment for potential biases.

For neglected tropical diseases, where there are likely limited numbers of ""shots on goal,"" such failures need to be assiduously avoided. Chagas disease drug discovery efforts have experienced more than its share of human clinical trial failures. Here are some guidelines, many specific for Chagas, but some that might also have application for other neglected tropical diseases. Chagas disease has major challenges (eg, the lack of a definitive test of cure) but also has outstanding advantages, among these the unmatched multi-species natural infection systems that can be exploited to de-risk compounds before human trials.

Morbidity and mortality are well correlated to the stage of renal function decline. Approximately one million deaths are estimated to be related to CKD worldwide. They are mostly associated with cardiovascular disease as a result of concurrent hypertension, accelerated atherosclerosis, and volume overload. Even with the best current treatment, disease progression is the general rule with a small fraction who reach CKD stage 5 requiring kidney transplantation or dialysis. Transplant patients show substantial reductions in mortality and cardiovascular events, as well as improvements in quality of life. However, the capacity of health systems to deliver kidney transplantation varies worldwide with worse indicators in low-income countries. Consequently, exploring novel and better therapeutic options for CKD is mandatory. Cell-based therapy is a promising strategy for treating CKD in preclinical models, and several clinical trials involving kidney disease exhibit a favorable safety profile.

36190992,Comparing in vivo bioluminescence imaging and the Multi-Cruzi immunoassay platform to develop improved Chagas disease diagnostic procedures and biomarkers for monitoring parasitological cure.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is a serious public health problem throughout Latin America. With 6 million people infected, there is a major international effort to develop new drugs. In the chronic phase of the disease, the parasite burden is extremely low, infections are highly focal at a tissue/organ level, and bloodstream parasites are only intermittently detectable. As a result, clinical trials are constrained by difficulties associated with determining parasitological cure. Even highly sensitive PCR methodologies can be unreliable, with a tendency to produce ""false-cure"" readouts. Improved diagnostic techniques and biomarkers for cure are therefore an important medical need.
Using an experimental mouse model, we have combined a multiplex assay system and highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging to evaluate serological procedures for diagnosis of T. cruzi infections and confirmation of parasitological cure. We identified a set of three antigens that in the context of the multiplex serology system, provide a rapid, reactive and highly accurate read-out of both acute and chronic T. cruzi infection. In addition, we describe specific antibody responses where down-regulation can be correlated with benznidazole-mediated parasite reduction and others where upregulation is associated with persistent infection. One specific antibody (IBAG39) highly correlated with the bioluminescence flux and represents a promising therapy monitoring biomarker in mice.
Robust, high-throughput methodologies for monitoring the efficacy of anti-T. cruzi drug treatment are urgently required. Using our experimental systems, we have identified markers of infection or parasite reduction that merit assessing in a clinical setting for the longitudinal monitoring of drug-treated patients.",,,,2022-10-04,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intradialytic aerobic exercise program on QoL and aerobic fitness in hemodialysis patients.
These are a secondary analysis of clinical trial data previously published in which hemodialysis patients were randomized into ""bike group"" (using an adapted exercise bicycle) or ""control group"" (usual care). The exercise sessions lasted 45 min (5 min of warm-up, 35 min of moderate-intensity and 5 min of cool-down) three times/week for three months. The QoL domains were assessed using the SF-36 QoL questionnaire. Aerobic fitness was evaluated using the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Circulating cytokines, biochemical parameters and Kt/V were also assessed.
Nine patients completed three months of exercise (5 men, 44 ± 11 years), and nine were in the control group (6 men, 44 ± 14 years).

The accumulation of this production, both cells themselves and of the immunoglobulins, causes a series of problems for the patient, of a systemic and local nature, such as blood hyperviscosity, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions, and infections due to compromised immunity. MM is the third most common hematological neoplasm, constituting 1% of all cancer cases, and is a disease that is difficult to treat, still being considered an incurable disease. The treatments currently available cannot cure the patient, but only extend their lifespan, and the main and most effective alternative is autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but not every patient is eligible, often due to age and pre-existing comorbidities. In this context, the search for new therapies that can bring better results to patients is of utmost importance. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are involved in several biological processes, such as cell growth regulation and proliferation, thus, mutations that affect their functionality can have a great impact on crucial molecular pathways in the cells, leading to tumorigenesis. In the past couple of decades, the use of small-molecule inhibitors, which include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), has been a hallmark in the treatment of hematological malignancies, and MM patients may also benefit from TKI-based treatment strategies.

We investigated possible relationships between pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and pharmacodynamic efficacy and safety data collected in an analysis population of 111 participants in CHICO, using a published population PK model to estimate nifurtimox exposure at the patient level. Pediatric exposure to nifurtimox was benchmarked against levels of nifurtimox exposure known to be effective in adults with Chagas disease. Given the complex dosing regimen for nifurtimox, we also modeled nifurtimox exposure associated with simpler dosing strategies. We found no relationship between exposure to nifurtimox and efficacy measures (e.g., serological response to treatment), or between exposure and safety outcomes (including typical adverse events, e.g., headache, decreased appetite, nausea/vomiting). The analysis population appeared to represent the overall CHICO population based on the similarity of their baseline characteristics and the profiles of adverse events in the two groups.

Data on investment in R&amp;D of ATMPs are recognized as scarce, particularly in developing countries. Because of the numerous peculiarities of the Brazilian health system and the science and technology (S&amp;T) system, the country is a good example for the evaluation of public investments in R&amp;D of ATMPs. The aim of this study is to analyze the evolution of investments made by the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Brazil and partners in the ATMP field between 2004 and 2020.

Chagas disease is caused by infection with the parasite Trypansoma cruzi . In nonendemic countries the disease is seen primarily in immigrants from Mexico, Central America and South America where the disease is endemic. Benznidazole or nifurtimox can be used for treatment. Posaconazole and fosravuconazole did not provide any additional benefit compared to benznidazole alone or in combination. A phase 2 randomized controlled trial suggests that shorter or reduced dosed regimes of benznidazole could be used. Based on a large randomized controlled trial, benznidazole is unlikely to have a significant preventive effect for established Chagas cardiomyopathy. Transplantation has become the treatment of choice for individuals with refractory Chagas cardiomyopathy. Cohort studies show similar posttransplant outcomes for these patients compared to other indications. Transplant candidates and donors with chronic T. cruzi infection are at risk for Chagas disease reactivation and transmitting infection. Screening them via serology is the first line of prevention. Recipients with chronic infection and those receiving organs from infected donors should undergo sequential monitoring with polymerase chain reaction for early detection of reactivation and preemptive treatment with antitrypanosomal therapy.

The intervention consisted of applying compressive taping over the seroma fluctuation area and maintained for 5 days. Evaluated outcomes comprised dermal changes caused by taping, subjective symptoms reported during the intervention period, and percent change in the punctured volume before and after the intervention.
A total of 35 women (mean age, 56.7 ± 12.2 years) were included. Most presented with an advanced disease stage (≥IIB; 62.9%). Although a 28.6% incidence of dermal changes caused by taping was observed, an average reduction in the aspirated volume of -28.2 mL was identified (95% confidence interval, -48.3 to -8.0; P = .008). Treatment adherence was high (91.4%), and most patients reported satisfaction with the treatment (85.7%).

Previous preclinical studies and few published clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Cannabis-based medicines in humans. Indeed, Cannabis-related medicines are used to treat multiple pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. In clinical practice, Cannabis products have already been introduced to treatment regimens of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis's patients, and the mechanisms of action behind the reported improvement in the clinical outcome and disease progression are associated with their anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, due to the modulation of the endocannabinoid system. In this review, we describe the role played by the endocannabinoid system in the physiopathology of Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Multiple Sclerosis, mainly at the neuroimmunological level. We also discuss the evidence for the correlation between phytocannabinoids and their therapeutic effects in these disorders, thus describing the main clinical studies carried out so far on the therapeutic performance of Cannabis-based medicines.",,,,2022-06-17,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
35657826,"Proactive strategies to optimize engagement of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, transgender, and nonbinary individuals in a trial of a novel agent for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).",,PloS one,"Black and Hispanic/Latinx cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women, transgender men, and gender nonbinary (TGNB) individuals have been historically underrepresented in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) clinical trials. There is an urgent need for ongoing engagement with communities that have been the most impacted by HIV and diverse representation in clinical trials. Here we describe strategic approaches undertaken in the PURPOSE 2 trial to optimize engagement of underrepresented individuals.
PURPOSE 2 is an ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir as PrEP in cisgender MSM and TGNB individuals. In PURPOSE 2, we used a multipronged approach aimed at enriching participation of underrepresented individuals. We conducted a review to identify evidence-informed recommendations from literature, engaged with stakeholders, and established the Global Community Advisory and Accountability Group (GCAG) to represent the needs of the community. Insights from stakeholders and GCAG members resulted in an expansion of the study population to include transgender men, gender nonbinary persons, and adolescents, and evaluation of population-specific outcomes. Feedback from stakeholders and GCAG members also informed investigator and site selection; these were selected based on prior experience working with persons from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities, and estimates of local HIV incidence. Site selection was also expanded to include community-based clinics with services tailored towards Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and TGNB populations. We established a study-wide recruitment goal of 50% Black MSM and 20% Hispanic/Latinx MSM in US sites and 20% transgender women globally. Site-specific recruitment goals were also developed based on local demographics and HIV incidence. Mandatory trainings included Good Participatory Practice guidelines, gender inclusivity, and antiracism.
While further work is needed to achieve equitable representation, the strategies we describe may serve as a framework for future clinical trials.

It is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole for CCD treatment.
We updated a meta-analysis published in 2009 up to February 2021, including controlled trials (RCT) and prospective observational studies (OBS) that compared benznidazole vs placebo/no-treatment (P/nT). Main outcomes evaluated were clinical progression (CP) and seroreversion with subgroup analysis performed according to study design and participants' age. Parasitological response and safety were also described. We identified 879 articles and selected nine for inclusion (corresponding to eight studies). After adding the nine articles from the previous meta-analysis, 17 studies were analyzed corresponding to 6640 patients. The odds ratio (OR) for seroreversion in children treated with benznidazole vs P/nT was 38.3 (95%CI: 10.7-137) and 34.9 (95%CI: 1.96-624.09) in RCT and OBS, respectively. In adults the OR for seroreversion in OBS was 17.1 (95%CI: 2.3-129.1). CP was only evaluated in adults, where benznidazole did not demonstrate a beneficial effect: OR 0.93 (95%CI: 0.8-1.1) and OR 0.49 (95%CI:0.2-1.2) for RCT and OBS, respectively. Most outcomes were deemed to have a low level of certainty, except for the beneficial effect in children and the low efficacy in adults (moderate certainty).
Benznidazole should be recommended for CCD in children, though this is only based on serological response and a moderate grade of evidence, while in adults benznidazole efficacy remains uncertain.

35421085,Two-year death prediction models among patients with Chagas Disease using machine learning-based methods.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease (CD) is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the thirteen most neglected tropical diseases. More than 80% of people affected by CD will not have access to diagnosis and continued treatment, which partly supports the high morbidity and mortality rate. Machine Learning (ML) can identify patterns in data that can be used to increase our understanding of a specific problem or make predictions about the future. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate different models of ML to predict death in two years of patients with CD. ML models were developed using different techniques and configurations. The techniques used were: Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks. The adopted settings considered only interview variables, only complementary exam variables, and finally, both mixed. Data from a cohort study with CD patients called SaMi-Trop were analyzed. The predictor variables came from the baseline; and the outcome, which was death, came from the first follow-up. All models were evaluated in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity and G-mean. Among the 1694 individuals with CD considered, 134 (7.9%) died within two years of follow-up. Using only the predictor variables from the interview, the different techniques achieved a maximum G-mean of 0.64 in predicting death. Using only the variables from complementary exams, the G-mean was up to 0.77. In this configuration, the protagonism of NT-proBNP was evident, where it was possible to observe that an ML model using only this single variable reached G-mean of 0.76. The configuration that mixed interview variables and complementary exams achieved G-mean of 0.75. ML can be used as a useful tool with the potential to contribute to the management of patients with CD, by identifying patients with the highest probability of death.

We randomized 659 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and classified them as having mild or moderate COVID-19 disease severity at hospital presentation using blood oxygen saturation and lung imaging. The primary outcome was the mean ratio of number of days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days according to disease severity.
At presentation, 376 patients (57.1%) had mild and 283 (42.9%) had moderate COVID-19. In patients with mild disease, there was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital between ACEI/ARB discontinuation (mean 23.5 [SD 6.3] days) and continuation (mean 23.8 [SD 6.5] days), with a mean ratio of 0.98 (95% CI 0.92-1.04). However, in patients with moderate disease, there were fewer days alive and out of the hospital with ACEI/ARB discontinuation (mean 19.6 [SD 9.5] days) than continuation (mean 21.6 [SD 7.6] days), with a mean ratio of 0.90 (95% CI 0.81-1.00; P-interaction = .01).

CCC afflicts millions of people, mostly in Latin America, and vaccine and effective therapy are still lacking. Comprehension of the host/parasite interplay in the chronic phase of T. cruzi infection may unveil targets for rational trait-based therapies to improve CCC prognosis. In the present viewpoint, I critically summarise a collection of data, obtained by our network of collaborators and other groups on CCC and preclinical studies on pathogenesis, targeting identification for intervention and the use of drugs with immunomodulatory properties to improve CCC. In the last two decades, models combining mouse lineages and T. cruzi strains allowed replication of crucial clinical, histopathological, and immunological traits of CCC. This condition includes conduction changes (heart rate changes, arrhythmias, atrioventricular blocks, prolongation of the QRS complex and PR and corrected QT intervals), ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, CD8-enriched myocarditis, tissue remodeling and progressive fibrosis, and systemic inflammatory profile, resembling ""cytokine storm"". Studies on Chagas' heart disease pathogenesis begins to unveil the molecular mechanisms underpinning the inflammation-related cardiac tissue damage, placing IFNγ, TNF and NFκB signaling as upstream regulators of miRNAs and mRNAs associated with critical biological pathways as cell migration, inflammation, tissue remodeling and fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, data on preclinical trials using hypothesis-based tools, targeting parasite and inflammation-related alterations, opened paths for multi-therapeutic approaches in CCC. Despite the long path taken using experimental CD models replicating relevant aspects of CCC and testing new therapies and therapeutic schemes, these findings may get lost in translation, as conceptual and economical challenges, underpinning the valley of death across preclinical and clinical trials.

Long-term symptoms may be due to consequences from organ or tissue injury caused by SARS-CoV-2, associated clotting or inflammatory processes during acute COVID-19. Various strategies are being chosen by clinicians to prevent severe cases of COVID-19; however, a single treatment would not be efficient in treating such a complex disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are known for their immunomodulatory properties and regeneration ability; therefore, they are a promising tool for treating disorders involving immune dysregulation and extensive tissue damage, as is the case with COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the safety and explore the long-term efficacy of three intravenous doses of UC-MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs) as an adjunctive therapy in the recovery and postacute sequelae reduction caused by COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is one of the few reports that presents the longest follow-up after MSC treatment in COVID-19 patients.

This is a secondary analysis of a randomized intervention community trial, in which a subgroup of 84 adolescents, aged between 10 and 12 years, were analyzed. Body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were determined before and after 8 months of follow-up. Glucose and serum insulin were examined at baseline and IR was defined based on the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), with a cutoff >2.5 for both genders. Linear mixed-effects models were performed to evaluate the influence of HOMA-IR at baseline on BMI changes over time. Models were adjusted for age, pubertal stage, and stratified by sex.

35293428,Repositioning drug strategy against Trypanosoma cruzi: lessons learned from HIV aspartyl peptidase inhibitors.,,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,"Chagas disease (CD) is an old neglected problem that affects more than 6 million people through 21 endemic countries in Latin America. Despite being responsible for more than 12 thousand deaths per year, the disease disposes basically of two drugs for its treatment, the nitroimidazole benznidazole and the nitrofuran nifurtimox. However, these drugs have innumerous limitations that greatly reduce the chances of cure. In Brazil, for example, only benznidazole is available to treat CD patients. Therefore, some proof-of-concept phase II clinical trials focused on improving the current treatment with benznidazole, also comparing it with repositioned drugs or combining them. Indeed, repositioning already marketed drugs in view of combating neglected tropical diseases is a very interesting approach in the context of decreased time for approval, better treatment options and low cost for development and implementation. After the introduction of human immunodeficiency virus aspartyl peptidase inhibitors (HIV-PIs) in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the prevalence and incidence of parasitic, fungal and bacterial co-infections suffered a marked reduction, making these HIV-PIs attractive for drug repositioning. In this line, the present perspective presents the promising and beneficial data concerning the effects of HIV-PIs on the clinically relevant forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (i.e., trypomastigotes and amastigotes) and also highlights the ultrastructural and physiological targets for the HIV-PIs on this parasite.

35275913,Double-antigen sandwich ELISA based on chimeric antigens for detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi in human sera.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are generally the chosen test for Chagas disease (CD) diagnosis; however, its performance depends on the antigen preparation adsorbed to the solid phase, which may lead to false-positive results and cross-reactions. The use of chimeric recombinant antigens can overcome this limitation. Four chimeric antigens from Trypanosoma cruzi (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4) were developed and evaluated in phase I, II and III studies using indirect ELISA as diagnostic platform. However, peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-human IgG antibody, which is employed in indirect ELISAs, limits its use for the detection of species-specific and class-specific antibodies. To overcome this limitation, peroxidase-labeled antigens can be utilized, diagnosing both acute or chronic infection, in a species and immunoglobulin class-independent manner, through the use of a double-antigen sandwich ELISA (DAgS-ELISA). We aimed to evaluate and validate the diagnostic performance of the chimeric antigens IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4 in the DAgS-ELISA platform.
DAgS-ELISA was optimized by checkerboard titration. In phase I study, 207 positive and 205 negative samples were evaluated. Cross-reactivity to other infections was also assessed using 68 samples. The selected conditions for the tests utilized 25 ng of antigen per well and the conjugate diluted at 1:2,000 for all molecules. In the phase I study, the areas under the curve of IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4 were 98.7%, 99.5%, 98.6% and 98.8%, respectively. Among the positive samples, IBMP-8.1 antigen classified 53 (25.6%) as false negative, IBMP-8.2, 27 (13%), IBMP-8.3, 24 (11.6%) and IBMP-8.4, 43 (20.8%), giving sensitivities of 74.4%, 87%, 88.4% and 79.2%, respectively. The only antigen that did not reach 100% specificity was IBMP-8.3, with 96.6%. IBMP-8.3 was also the only molecule to show cross-reactivity with HTLV.
DAgS-ELISA is a promising tool for immunodiagnosis, and despite the high AUC values, the performance of this assay was different from the values obtained by our group when using these antigens in the indirect ELISA, for this reason, improvements are being considered to increase the sensitivity of the DAgS-ELISA.",,,,2022-03-12,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The aetiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, displays varied cell invading tactics and triggers different host cell signals, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) can be synthetized by certain members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family: PARP-1/-2 and Tankyrases-1/2 (TNKS). PAR homoeostasis participates in the host cell response to T. cruzi infection and TNKS are involved in Wnt signalling, among other pathways. Therefore, we hypothesized that TNKS inhibitors (TNKSi) could hamper T. cruzi infection. We showed that five TNKSi (FLALL9, MN64, XAV939, G007LK and OULL9) diminished T. cruzi infection of Vero cells. As most TNKSi did not affect the viability of axenically cultivated parasites, our results suggested that TNKSi were interfering with parasite–host cell signalling. Infection by T. cruzi induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin, as well as upregulation of TNF-α expression and secretion. These changes were hampered by TNKSi. Further signals should be monitored in this model and in vivo. As a TNKSi has entered cancer clinical trials with promising results, our findings encourage further studies aiming at drug repurposing strategies.",,,,2022-01-22,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Benznidazole (BZN) and nifurtimox (NFX) are the only approved drugs for CD chemotherapy. Although both drugs are highly effective in acute and paediatric infections, their efficacy in adults with chronic CD (CCD) is lower and variable. Moreover, the high incidence of adverse events (AEs) with both drugs has hampered their widespread use. Trials in CCD adults showed that quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays remain negative for 12 months after standard-of-care (SoC) BZN treatment in ~80% patients. BZN pharmacokinetic data and the nonsynchronous nature of the proliferative mammal-dwelling parasite stage suggested that a lower BZN/NFX dosing frequency, combined with standard or extended treatment duration, might have the same or better efficacy than either drug SoC, with fewer AEs.
New ThErapies and Biomarkers for ChagaS infEctiOn (TESEO) is an open-label, randomised, prospective, phase-2 clinical trial, with six treatment arms (75 patients/arm, 450 patients). Primary objectives are to compare the safety and efficacy of two new proposed chemotherapy regimens of BZN and NFX in adults with CCD with the current SoC for BZN and NFX, evaluated by qPCR and biomarkers for 36 months posttreatment and correlated with CD conventional serology. Recruitment of patients was initiated on 18 December 2019 and on 20 May 2021, 450 patients (study goal) were randomised among the six treatment arms. The treatment phase was finalised on 18 August 2021. Secondary objectives include evaluation of population pharmacokinetics of both drugs in all treatment arms, the incidence of AEs, and parasite genotyping.
The TESEO study was approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), federal regulatory agency of the Plurinational State of Bolivia and the Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. The results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals, conferences and reports to the NIH, FDA and participating institutions.

We assessed clinical performance and ease-of-use of seven Ag-RDTs in a prospective, manufacturer-independent, multi-centre cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study to inform global decision makers.
Unvaccinated participants suspected of a first SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited at six sites (Germany, Brazil). Ag-RDTs were evaluated sequentially, with collection of paired swabs for routine reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and Ag-RDT testing. Performance was compared to RT-PCR overall and in sub-group analyses (viral load, symptoms, symptoms duration). To understandusability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.
7471 participants were included in the analysis. Sensitivities across Ag-RDTs ranged from 70·4%-90·1%, specificities were above 97·2% for all Ag-RDTs but one (93·1%).Ag-RDTs, Mologic, Bionote, Standard Q, showed diagnostic accuracy in line with WHO targets (> 80% sensitivity, > 97% specificity). All tests showed high sensitivity in the first three days after symptom onset (≥87·1%) and in individuals with viral loads≥ 6 log
Variability in test performance is partially explained by variable viral loads in population evaluated over the course of the pandemic. All Ag-RDTs reach high sensitivity early in the disease and in individuals with high viral loads, supporting their role in identifying transmission relevant infections. For easy-to-use tests, performance shown will likely be maintained in routine implementation.

Current treatments are inadequate, and recent clinical trials of drugs inhibiting CYP51 have failed, exposing a lack of understanding of how to translate laboratory findings to the clinic. Following these failures many new model systems have been developed, both in vitro and in vivo, that provide improved understanding of the causes for clinical trial failures. Amongst these are in vitro rate-of-kill (RoK) assays that reveal how fast compounds kill intracellular parasites. Such assays have shown clear distinctions between the compounds that failed in clinical trials and the standard of care. However, the published RoK assays have some key drawbacks, including low time-resolution and inability to track the same cell population over time. Here, we present a new, live-imaging RoK assay for intracellular T. cruzi that overcomes these issues. We show that the assay is highly reproducible and report high time-resolution RoK data for key clinical compounds as well as new chemical entities. The data generated by this assay allow fast acting compounds to be prioritised for progression, the fate of individual parasites to be tracked, shifts of mode-of-action within series to be monitored, better PKPD modelling and selection of suitable partners for combination therapy.",,,,2021-10-12,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The main objective was to evaluate different treatment regimens with meglumine antimoniate (MA), in a reference center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
A historical cohort of 592 patients that underwent physical and laboratory examination were enrolled between 2000 and 2017. The outcome measures of effectiveness were epithelialization and complete healing of cutaneous lesions. AE were graded using a standardized scale. Three groups were evaluated: Standard regimen (SR): intramuscular (IM) MA 10-20 mg Sb5+/kg/day during 20 days (n = 46); Alternative regimen (AR): IM MA 5 mg Sb5+/kg/day during 30 days (n = 456); Intralesional route (IL): MA infiltration in the lesion(s) through subcutaneous injections (n = 90). Statistical analysis was performed through Fisher exact and Pearson Chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis, Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests.
SR, AR and IL showed efficacy of 95.3%, 84.3% and 75.9%, with abandonment rate of 6.5%, 2.4% and 3.4%, respectively. IL patients had more comorbidities (58.9%; p = 0.001), were mostly over 50 years of age (55.6%), and had an evolution time longer than 2 months (65.6%; p = 0.02). Time for epithelialization and complete healing were similar in IL and IM MA groups (p = 0.9 and p = 0.5; respectively).

34525920,Natural and Synthetic Naphthoquinones as Potential Anti-Infective Agents.,"Leishmania spp., Naphthoquinones, Plasmodium falciparum, Toxocara canis., Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,"Naphthoquinones are a class of aromatic compounds relevant for their chemical characteristics, structural properties, and biological activity. These compounds are found in nature with a wide range of effects, highlighting their antibacterial, antifungal, and antiprotozoal properties. Additionally, naphthoquinones are used as a scaffold to obtain new derivatives with pharmacological potential, mainly compounds against parasitic diseases.
The purpose of this work was to carry out a comprehensive review of naphthoquinones and their derivatives obtained from both natural and synthetic sources, also, to analyze their biological activity against Leishmania spp. (Leishmaniasis), Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis), and Toxocara canis (Toxocariasis). All of these agents are responsible for relevant diseases worldwide.
Natural naphthoquinones, such as plumbagin, diospyrin, burmanin, lapachol, lawsone and psychorubrin, show an antiprotozoal activity similar or enhanced antiprotozoal activity to reference drugs. Some naphthoquinones obtained by synthesis or semi-synthesis showed better biological activity or less toxic effects than natural compounds.
In this review, natural and synthetic naphthoquinones showed antiparasitic activity, in most cases, with improved results than current drugs currently used in clinical trials. A modification of their structure with different functional groups can enhance their biological effects, improve solubility, and reduce undesirable side effects.

34398888,The Chagas disease study landscape: A systematic review of clinical and observational antiparasitic treatment studies to assess the potential for establishing an individual participant-level data platform.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects ~6-7 million people worldwide. Significant limitations still exist in our understanding of CD. Harnessing individual participant data (IPD) from studies could support more in-depth analyses to address the many outstanding research questions. This systematic review aims to describe the characteristics and treatment practices of clinical studies in CD and assess the breadth and availability of research data for the potential establishment of a data-sharing platform.
This review includes prospective CD clinical studies published after 1997 with patients receiving a trypanocidal treatment. The following electronic databases and clinical trial registry platforms were searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Scielo, Clintrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Of the 11,966 unique citations screened, 109 (0.9%) studies (31 observational and 78 interventional) representing 23,116 patients were included. Diagnosis for patient enrolment required 1 positive test result in 5 (4.6%) studies (2 used molecular method, 1 used molecular and serology, 2 used serology and parasitological methods), 2 in 60 (55.0%), 3 in 14 (12.8%) and 4 or more in 4 (3.7%) studies. A description of treatment regimen was available for 19,199 (83.1%) patients, of whom 14,605 (76.1%) received an active treatment and 4,594 (23.9%) were assigned to a placebo/no-treatment. Of the 14,605 patients who received an active treatment, benznidazole was administered in 12,467 (85.4%), nifurtimox in 825 (5.6%), itraconazole in 284 (1.9%), allopurinol in 251 (1.7%) and other drugs in 286 (1.9%). Assessment of efficacy varied largely and was based primarily on biological outcome; parasitological efficacy relied on serology in 67/85 (78.8%) studies, molecular methods in 52/85 (61.2%), parasitological in 34/85 (40.0%), microscopy in 3/85 (3.5%) and immunohistochemistry in 1/85 (1.2%). The median time at which parasitological assessment was carried out was 79 days [interquartile range (IQR): 30-180] for the first assessment, 180 days [IQR: 60-500] for second, and 270 days [IQR: 18-545] for the third assessment.
This review demonstrates the heterogeneity of clinical practice in CD treatment and in the conduct of clinical studies. The sheer volume of potential IPD identified demonstrates the potential for development of an IPD platform for CD and that such efforts would enable in-depth analyses to optimise the limited pharmacopoeia of CD and inform prospective data collection.",,,,2021-08-17,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial to compare long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA, an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) at a dose of 600 mg, given intramuscularly every 8 weeks, with daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) for the prevention of HIV infection in at-risk cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and in at-risk transgender women who have sex with men. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive one of the two regimens and were followed for 153 weeks. HIV testing and safety evaluations were performed. The primary end point was incident HIV infection.
The intention-to-treat population included 4566 participants who underwent randomization; 570 (12.5%) identified as transgender women, and the median age was 26 years (interquartile range, 22 to 32). The trial was stopped early for efficacy on review of the results of the first preplanned interim end-point analysis. Among 1698 participants from the United States, 845 (49.8%) identified as Black. Incident HIV infection occurred in 52 participants: 13 in the cabotegravir group (incidence, 0.41 per 100 person-years) and 39 in the TDF-FTC group (incidence, 1.22 per 100 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.62).

However, there are scant data on vaginal viral load (VVL) in pregnant women with undetectable plasma viral load (PVL).
This study was a post hoc analysis of an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the virologic response of 2 ART regimens. The participants were ART-naive women living with HIV initiating ART regimens between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy recruited at 19 clinical sites in 6 countries. Participants were randomized to receive 400 mg of raltegravir 2 times a day or 600 mg of efavirenz 4 times a day in addition to 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of zidovudine 2 times a day. VVL and PVL tests were performed at every study visit. The primary outcome measures were HIV-1 PVL and VVL at maternal study week 4 and rates of perinatal HIV transmission.
A total of 408 were enrolled, of whom 323 had VVL samples 4 weeks after enrollment and were included in this analysis. Among women with undetectable/nonquantifiable PVL during ART, the overall rate of quantifiable VVL at week 4 was 2.54% (7/275). Of the 275 with nonquantifiable PVL, 99.1% (115/116) and 96.2% (153/159) had nonquantifiable VVL in the efavirenz and raltegravir arms, respectively.

34270544,Rate-of-Kill (RoK) assays to triage large compound sets for Chagas disease drug discovery: Application to GSK Chagas Box.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease (CD) is a human disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Whilst endemic in Latin America, the disease is spread around the world due to migration flows, being estimated that 8 million people are infected worldwide and over 10,000 people die yearly of complications linked to CD. Current chemotherapeutics is restricted to only two drugs, i.e. benznidazole (BNZ) and nifurtimox (NIF), both being nitroaromatic compounds sharing mechanism of action and exerting suboptimal efficacy and serious adverse effects. Recent clinical trials conducted to reposition antifungal azoles have turned out disappointing due to poor efficacy outcomes despite their promising preclinical profile. This apparent lack of translation from bench models to the clinic raises the question of whether we are using the right in vitro tools for compound selection. We propose that speed of action and cidality, rather than potency, are properties that can differentiate those compounds with better prospect of success to show efficacy in animal models of CD. Here we investigate the use of in vitro assays looking at the kinetics of parasite kill as a valuable surrogate to tell apart slow- (i.e. azoles targeting CYP51) and fast-acting (i.e. nitroaromatic) compounds. Data analysis and experimental design have been optimised to make it amenable for high-throughput compound profiling. Automated data reduction of experimental kinetic points to tabulated curve descriptors in conjunction with PCA, k-means and hierarchical clustering provide drug discoverers with a roadmap to guide navigation from hit qualification of a screening campaign to compound optimisation programs and assessment of combo therapy potential. As an example, we have studied compounds belonging to the GSK Chagas Box stemmed from the HTS campaign run against the full GSK 1.8 million compounds collection [1].",,,,2021-07-17,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
34230959,Improving the detection of infectious diseases in at-risk migrants with an innovative integrated multi-infection screening digital decision support tool (IS-MiHealth) in primary care: a pilot cluster-randomized-controlled trial.,,Journal of travel medicine,"There are major shortfalls in the identification and screening of at-risk migrant groups. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new digital tool (IS-MiHealth) integrated into the electronic patient record system of primary care centres in detecting prevalent migrant infections. IS-MiHealth provides targeted recommendations to health professionals for screening multiple infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C, active tuberculosis (TB), Chagas disease, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis, based on patient characteristics (including variables of country of origin, age and sex).
A pragmatic pilot cluster-randomized-controlled trial was deployed from March to December 2018. Eight primary care centres in Catalonia, Spain, were randomly allocated 1:1 to use of the digital tool for screening, or to routine care. The primary outcome was the monthly diagnostic yield of all aggregated infections. Intervention and control sites were compared before and after implementation with respect to their monthly diagnostic yield using regression models. This study is registered on international standard randomised controlled trial number (ISRCTN) (ISRCTN14795012).
A total of 15 780 migrants registered across the eight centres had at least one visit during the intervention period (March-December 2018), of which 14 598 (92.51%) fulfilled the criteria to be screened for at least one infection. There were 210 (2.57%) individuals from the intervention group with new diagnoses compared with 113 (1.49%) from the control group [odds ratio: 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63-2.64, P < 0.001]. The intervention centres raised their overall monthly diagnosis rate to 5.80 (95% CI 1.23-10.38, P = 0.013) extra diagnoses compared with the control centres. This monthly increase in diagnosis in intervention centres was also observed if we consider all cases together of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and active TB cases [2.72 (95% CI 0.43-5.00); P = 0.02] and was observed as well for the parasitic infections' group (Chagas disease, strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis) 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-3.57; P < 0.001).

Following a mostly asymptomatic acute phase, the disease progresses to a long-lasting chronic phase throughout which life-threatening disorders to the heart and/or gastrointestinal tract will manifest in about 30% of those chronically infected. During the chronic phase, the parasitemia is low and intermittent, while a high level of anti-T. cruzi antibodies persist for years. These two features hamper post-chemotherapeutic follow-up of patients with the tools available. The lack of biomarkers for timely assessment of therapeutic response discourages a greater use of the two available anti-parasitic drugs, and complicates the evaluation of new drugs in clinical trials. Herein, we investigated in a blinded case-control study the serological reactivity over time of a group of parasite-derived antigens to potentially address follow up of T. cruzi chronically infected subjects after treatment. We tested PFR2, KMP11, HSP70, 3973, F29 and the InfYnity multiplexed antigenic array, by means of serological assays on a multi-national retrospective collection of samples.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive a single transfusion of either convalescent plasma or normal control plasma. The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days following randomization, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.RESULTSOf 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to receive normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in the clinical scale was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, P = 0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.034).

33846735,Effectiveness of a school-based randomized controlled trial aimed at increasing physical activity time in adolescents.,,European journal of public health,"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of obesity prevention educational activities, isolated or combined with the modification of the school environment on total physical activity time.
This is a school-based randomized controlled trial, conducted with 2511 students from fifth and sixth-grade in Brazil, that employed a parallel, three-group experimental arms: control group (CG), PAAPPAS group (PG) and PAAPPAS-environment group (PEG). During the 2016 school year, the PG received educational activities in the classroom, providing a general basis for a healthy lifestyle. The PEG received the same educational activities and also modifications in the school environment to stimulate physical activity practice during one month. Physical activity was evaluated through a validated physical activity questionnaire. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed to evaluate the rate of change of physical activity time between groups using PROC GENMOD procedure. All analyses were performed using SAS.
Total physical activity time increased by 22% in PEG compared with CG (P = 0.003). No difference was observed between PEG and PG (Δ = 60.20 vs. 36.37, respectively; P = 0.27) and between PG and CG (Δ = 36.37 vs. 9.70, respectively; P = 0.23). The proportion of individuals who attended at least 150 min week-1 of physical activity increased in PEG compared with PG (P = 0.04); however, no difference was observed between PEG and CG (P = 0.19) and between PG and CG (P = 0.26).

Infectious diseases,"Current treatment for Chagas disease with the only available drugs, benznidazole or nifurtimox, has substantial limitations, including long treatment duration and safety and tolerability concerns. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new benznidazole monotherapy regimens and combinations with fosravuconazole, in the treatment of Chagas disease.
We did a double-blind, double-dummy, phase 2, multicentre, randomised trial in three outpatient units in Bolivia. Adults aged 18-50 years with chronic indeterminate Chagas disease, confirmed by serological testing and positive qualitative PCR results, were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of seven treatment groups using a balanced block randomisation scheme with an interactive response system. Participants were assigned to benznidazole 300 mg daily for 8 weeks, 4 weeks, or 2 weeks, benznidazole 150 mg daily for 4 weeks, benznidazole 150 mg daily for 4 weeks plus fosravuconazole, benznidazole 300 mg once per week for 8 weeks plus fosravuconazole, or placebo, with a 12-month follow-up period. The primary endpoints were sustained parasitological clearance at 6 months, defined as persistent negative qualitative PCR results from end of treatment, and incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. Primary efficacy analysis was based on the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations and secondary efficacy analyses on the per-protocol population. Safety analyses were based on the as-treated population. Recruitment is now closed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03378661.
Between Nov 30, 2016, and July 27, 2017, we screened 518 patients, and 210 were enrolled and randomised. 30 patients (14%) were assigned to each treatment group. All 210 randomised patients were included in the intention-to-treat population, and 190 (90%) were included in the per-protocol population. In the intention-to-treat analysis, only one (3%) of 30 patients in the placebo group had sustained parasitological clearance at 6 months of follow-up. Sustained parasitological clearance at 6 months was observed in 25 (89%) of 28 patients receiving benznidazole 300 mg daily for 8 weeks (rate difference vs placebo 86% [95% CI 73-99]), 25 (89%) of 28 receiving benznidazole 300 mg daily for 4 weeks (86% [73-99]), 24 (83%) of 29 receiving benznidazole 300 mg daily for 2 weeks (79% [64-95]), 25 (83%) of 30 receiving benznidazole 150 mg daily for 4 weeks (80% [65-95]), 23 (85%) of 28 receiving benznidazole 150 mg daily for 4 weeks plus fosravuconazole (82% [67-97]), and 24 (83%) of 29 receiving benznidazole 300 mg weekly for 8 weeks plus fosravuconazole (79% [64-95]; p<0·0001 for all group comparisons with placebo). Six patients (3%) had ten serious adverse events (leukopenia [n=3], neutropenia [n=2], pyrexia, maculopapular rash, acute cholecystitis, biliary polyp, and breast cancer), eight had 12 severe adverse events (defined as interfering substantially with the patient's usual functions; elevated alanine aminotransferase [n=4], elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase [n=2], elevated aspartate aminotransferase [n=1], neutropenia [n=3], leukopenia [n=1], and breast cancer [n=1]), and 15 (7%) had adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation (most of these were in the groups who received benznidazole 300 mg daily for 8 weeks, benznidazole 300 mg once per week for 8 weeks plus fosravuconazole, and benznidazole 150 mg daily for 4 weeks plus fosravuconazole). No adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in patients treated with benznidazole 300 mg daily for 2 weeks or placebo. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Benznidazole induced effective antiparasitic response, regardless of treatment duration, dose, or combination with fosravuconazole, and was well tolerated in adult patients with chronic Chagas disease. Shorter or reduced regimens of benznidazole could substantially improve treatment tolerability and accessibility, but further studies are needed to confirm these results.

We examined the association of prestroke PA with adverse health outcomes in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities).
We included 881 participants with incident stroke occurring between 1993 and 1995 (visit 3) and December 31, 2016. Follow-up continued until December 31, 2017 to allow for at least 1-year after incident stroke. Prestroke PA was assessed using a modified version of the Baecke questionnaire in 1987 to 1989 (visit 1) and 1993 to 1995 (visit 3), evaluating PA domains (work, leisure, and sports) and total PA. We used Cox proportional hazards models to quantify the association between tertiles of accumulated prestroke PA levels over the 6-year period between visits 1 and 3 and mortality, risk of cardiovascular disease, and recurrent stroke after incident stroke.
During a median follow-up of 3.1 years after incident stroke, 676 (77%) participants had adverse outcomes. Highest prestroke total PA was associated with decreased risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63-0.97]) compared with lowest tertile.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is used for treatment monitoring, but variability in copy dosage and sequences of molecular target genes among different Trypanosoma cruzi strains limit the precision of quantitative measures. To improve qPCR quantification accuracy, we designed and evaluated a synthetic DNA molecule containing a satellite DNA (satDNA) repeat unit as standard for quantification of T. cruzi loads in clinical samples, independently of the parasite strain. Probit regression analysis established for Dm28c (TcI) and CL-Brener (TcVI) stocks similar 95% limit of detection values [0.903 (0.745 to 1.497) and 0.667 (CI, 0.113 to 3.927) copy numbers/μL, respectively] when synthetic DNA was the standard for quantification, allowing direct comparison of loads in samples infected with different discrete typing units. This standard curve was evaluated in 205 samples (38 acute oral and 19 chronic Chagas disease patients) from different geographical areas infected with various genotypes, including samples obtained during treatment follow-up; high agreement with parasitic load trends using standard curves based on DNA extracted from spiked blood with counted parasites was obtained.

To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days.
A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020).
Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs.
The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression.
Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%).
Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications.

We investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nifurtimox administered as divisible, dispersible 30 mg and 120 mg tablets in children with Chagas disease. In this blinded, controlled study conducted January 2016-July 2018, 330 patients aged <18 years from 25 medical centres across three South American countries were randomised 2:1 to nifurtimox 10-20 mg/kg/day (aged <12 years) or 8-10 mg/kg/day (aged ≥12 years) for 60 days (n = 219), or for 30 days plus placebo for 30 days (n = 111) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02625974). The primary outcome was anti-Trypanosoma cruzi serological response (negative seroconversion or seroreduction ≥20% in mean optical density from baseline determined by two conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) at 12 months in the 60-day treatment group versus historical placebo controls. Nifurtimox for 60 days achieved negative seroconversion (n = 10) and seroreduction (n = 62) in 72 patients (serological response 32.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 26.4%, 39.3%, of all treated patients), confirming superiority relative to the upper 95% CI of 16% for controls. In patients aged <8 months, 10/12 treated for 60 days (83.3%) and 5/7 treated for 30 days (71.4%) achieved negative seroconversion. Overall serological response was lower for 30-day than for 60-day nifurtimox (between-treatment difference 14.0% [95% CI 3.7%, 24.2%]). The frequency of T. cruzi-positive quantitative polymerase chain reactions decreased substantially from baseline levels (60-day regimen 53.4% versus 1.4%; 30-day regimen 51.4% versus 4.5%). Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which were observed in 62 patients (28.3%) treated for 60 days and 29 patients (26.1%) treated for 30 days, were generally mild or moderate and resolved without sequelae; 4.2% of all TEAEs led to nifurtimox discontinuation. Age- and weight-adjusted nifurtimox for 60 days achieved a serological response at 12 months post-treatment that was superior to historical placebo, was well tolerated and had a favourable safety profile in children with Chagas disease. Although, at 1 year serological follow-up, efficacy of the shorter nifurtimox treatment was not comparable to the 60-day treatment regimen for the overall study population, further long-term follow-up of the patients will provide important information about the progress of serological conversion in children treated with nifurtimox, as well as the potential efficacy difference between the two regimens over time.",,,,2021-01-08,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

While cardiac complications such as conduction problems and heart failure are very common in Chagas disease there is little known about the long-term effects of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) on cardiac sequelae in Sub-Saharan Africa, where heart failure has become an increasing problem and growing burden. In the context of clinical trials conducted between 2004 and 2005 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the prevalence of HAT related signs and symptoms and an ECG were evaluated prior to the initiation of treatment. The object of this follow-up study in 2017 was to assess the prevalence of cardiac sequelae in the same 51 first stage and 18  second stage HAT patients 12-13 years after their treatment by conducting a clinical examination and an ECG. A control group matched by age (± 5 years), sex and whenever possible form the same village was enrolled. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of cardiac symptoms and in ECG findings between patients and their controls at the time of the follow-up evaluation. Repolarization changes disappeared or improved in 24.7% of HAT patients and were even less frequent than in the control group. Peripheral low voltage was the only parameter that increased over time in HAT patients and in three patients, new conduction problems in the ECG (ventricular bigeminy, RBBB, and bifascicular block) could be found, although none of these findings was clinically significant. However, the appearance of these conduction problems might represent an early indication of a HAT related cardiomyopathy or ongoing subclinical infection.

One of the important contributions expected of pharmaceutical companies is the development and provision of drugs effective against NTDs. Eisai's efforts toward improving global health have resulted in a rich portfolio of assets addressing six infectious diseases: malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, and mycetoma. As the most advanced project, Eisai has developed E1224 (fosravuconazole l-lysine ethanolate), which is available in both intravenous and oral formulations, and provides ravuconazole, an active form of fosravuconazole, with a long plasma half-life. The first clinical trials of E1224, for Chagas disease, have already been completed, led by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). As a result, parasite clearance was observed with E1224 during the treatment phase, but parasite regrowth was observed after the end of drug administration, suggesting that the mechanism of action of E1224 on Trypanosoma cruzi is static rather than parasiticidal. On the other hand, a clinical trial for eumycetoma in collaboration with DNDi is ongoing supported by the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund, and is examining the efficacy of weekly treatment with E1224 versus the current standard of care, daily treatment with itraconazole.

The available therapeutics display substantial limitations, among them limited efficacy, safety issues, drug resistance, and, in some cases, inconvenient routes of administration, which made the scenarios with insufficient health infrastructure settings inconvenient. Pharmaceutical nanocarriers may provide solutions to some of these obstacles, improving the efficacy-safety balance and tolerability to therapeutic interventions. Here, we overview the state of the art of therapeutics for trypanosomatid-caused diseases (including approved drugs and drugs undergoing clinical trials) and the literature on nanolipid pharmaceutical carriers encapsulating approved and non-approved drugs for these diseases.

Drugs to eliminate the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T cruzi) currently carry limited therapeutic value and are used in the early stages of the disease. Extending the use of these drugs to treat chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) has also been proposed.
To assess the benefits and harms of nitrofurans and trypanocidal drugs for treating late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC in terms of blood parasite reduction or clearance, mortality, adverse effects, and quality of life.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases on 12 November 2019. We also searched two clinical trials registers, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), on 3 December 2019.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing trypanocidal drugs versus placebo or no treatment for late-stage, symptomatic Chagas disease and CCC.
We conducted the reporting of the review according the standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently retrieved articles, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by a third review author. We contacted study authors for additional information.
We included two studies in this review update. One RCT randomly assigned 26 participants to benznidazole 5 mg/kg/day; 27 participants to nifurtimox 5 mg/kg/day; and 24 participants to placebo for 30 days. The second RCT, newly included in this update, randomised 1431 participants to benznidazole 300 mg/day for 40 to 80 days and 1423 participants to placebo. We also identified one ongoing study. Benznidazole compared to placebo At five-year follow-up, low quality of the evidence suggests that there may be a benefit of benznidazole when compared to placebo for clearance or reduction of antibody titres (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.37; 1 trial; 1896 participants). We are uncertain about the effects of benznidazole for the clearance of parasitaemia demonstrated by negative xenodiagnosis, blood culture, and/or molecular assays due to very limited evidence. Low quality of the evidence suggests that when compared to placebo, benznidazole may make little to no difference in the risk of heart failure (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; 1 trial; 2854 participants) and ventricular tachycardia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.26; 1 trial; 2854 participants). We found moderate quality of the evidence that adverse events increase with benznidazole when compared to placebo (RR 2.52, 95% CI 2.09 to 3.03; 1 trial; 2854 participants). Adverse effects were observed in 23.9% of patients in the benznidazole group compared to 9.5% in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse effects were: cutaneous rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, and peripheral polyneuropathy. No data were available for the outcomes of pathological demonstration of tissue parasites and quality of life. Nifurtimox compared to placebo Data were only available for this comparison for the outcome clearance or reduction of antibody titres, and we are uncertain about the effect due to very limited evidence. Regarding adverse events, one RCT mentioned in a general manner that nifurtimox caused intense adverse events, without any quantification.

Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America, and medical care for the disease is the major expense for Brazil's Universal Healthcare System (Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). The efficacy of the available drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox are low for the chronic phase of Chagas disease, the phase in which most patients are diagnosed, and there are frequent side effects, and drug resistance occurs. The rapid deployment of new drug regimens that are effective for the chronic phase treatment is low-cost and less toxic than the currently available therapy, which is a global priority. Repurposing drugs already in clinical use with other combinations would be the fastest and safest strategy for treating Chagas disease patients. We hypothesize that the combined treatment using repurposing drugs with benznidazole will be more efficacious than benznidazole alone. This needs to be tested further both in vitro and in animal models to understand the efficacy of the treatment before performing human clinical trials. We further hypothesize that producing nanoparticle formulation of the drugs can reduce their toxicity and improve therapeutic use.",,,,2020-11-27,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

HIV,"Fostemsavir, a prodrug of the first-in-class attachment inhibitor, temsavir, is indicated for heavily treatment-experienced individuals with multidrug-resistant HIV-1. We previously reported superior efficacy of fostemsavir versus placebo in the randomised cohort of the BRIGHTE study after 8-day functional monotherapy (primary endpoint); here we report planned interim analyses through week 96.
BRIGHTE (NCT02362503) is an ongoing multicentre, two-cohort, phase 3 trial, done at 108 centres in 22 countries. We enrolled heavily treatment-experienced adults (≥18 years) failing antiretroviral therapy (HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies per mL) into two cohorts: the randomised cohort, in which patients with one or two fully active antiretrovirals remaining received oral fostemsavir (600 mg twice a day) or placebo in combination with their failing regimen for 8 days, followed by fostemsavir plus optimised background therapy; or the non-randomised cohort, in which patients with no remaining antiretroviral options received oral fostemsavir (600 mg twice a day) plus optimised background therapy from day 1. Endpoints for the week 96 interim analyses included the proportions of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA of less than 40 copies per mL, changes from baseline in CD4 cell counts, and the frequency of adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and deaths. The intention-to-treat exposed population and the safety population both included all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The response rates (proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA <40 copies per mL) in the intention-to-treat exposed population were calculated via snapshot analysis at weeks 24, 48, and 96.
Between Feb 23, 2015, and Aug 11, 2016, 371 participants were enrolled and treated, of which 272 participants were in the randomised cohort and 99 in the non-randomised cohort. 320 (86%) of 371 reported a history of AIDS. In the randomised cohort, rates of virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA <40 copies per mL) increased from 53% (144 of 272) at week 24 to 60% (163 of 272) at week 96. Response rates in the non-randomised cohort were 37% (37 of 99) at week 24 and week 96. Mean increases in CD4 counts from baseline at week 96 were 205 cells per μL (SD 191) in the randomised cohort and 119 cells per μL (202) in the non-randomised cohort. Mean CD4/CD8 ratio increased from 0·20 at baseline to 0·44 at week 96 in the randomised cohort. Few adverse events led to discontinuation (26 [7%] of 371). 12 (4%) of 272 people in the randomised cohort and 17 (17%) of 99 in the non-randomised cohort died; the median baseline CD4 count for participants who died was 11 cells per μL.
In heavily treatment-experienced individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease and limited treatment options, fostemsavir-based antiretroviral regimens were generally well tolerated and showed a distinctive trend of increasing virological and immunological response rates through 96 weeks; these findings support fostemsavir as a treatment option for this vulnerable population.

Treatment is suboptimal due to two factors. First, the lack of an adequate biomarker to predict disease severity and response to therapy; and second, up to 120-days treatment course coupled with a significant incidence of adverse effects from the drug currently used. Because the disease can manifest itself clinically a few years to decades after infection, controversy remains concerning the suitability of current drug treatment (benznidazole), and the efficacy of alternative drugs (e.g. posaconazole). We therefore followed the clinical course, and PCR detection of parasite burden, in a mouse model of infection for a full year following treatment with benznidazole or posaconazole. Efficacy of the two drugs depended on whether the treatment was performed during the acute model or the chronic model of infection.

This study evaluated the effects of exercise training (ET) in restoring peripheral and cardiac autonomic control and skeletal muscle phenotype in patients with subclinical chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.
This controlled trial (NCT02295215) included 24 chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy patients who were randomized www.random.org/lists/ into two groups: those who underwent exercise training (n = 12) and those who continued their usual activities (n = 12). Eight patients completed the exercise training protocol, and 10 patients were clinically followed up for 4 months. Muscular sympathetic nerve activity was measured by microneurography and muscle blood flow (MBF) using venous occlusion plethysmography. The low-frequency component of heart rate variability in normalized units (LFnuHR) reflects sympathetic activity in the heart, and the low-frequency component of systolic blood pressure variability in normalized units reflects sympathetic activity in the vessels. The infusion of vasoactive drugs (phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside) was used to evaluate cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, and a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy was performed to evaluate atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 gene expression.
The baroreflex sensitivity for increases (p = 0.002) and decreases (p = 0.02) in systolic blood pressure increased in the ET group. Muscle blood flow also increased only in the ET group (p = 0.004). Only the ET group had reduced resting muscular sympathetic nerve activity levels (p = 0.008) and sympathetic activity in the heart (LFnu; p = 0.004) and vessels (p = 0.04) after 4 months. Regarding skeletal muscle, after 4 months, participants in the exercise training group presented with lower atrogin-1 gene expression than participants who continued their activities as usual (p = 0.001). The reduction in muscular sympathetic nerve activity was positively associated with reduced atrogin-1 (r = 0.86; p = 0.02) and MuRF-1 gene expression (r = 0.64; p = 0.06); it was negatively associated with improved baroreflex sensitivity both for increases (r = -0.72; p = 0.020) and decreases (r = -0.82; p = 0.001) in blood pressure.
ET improved cardiac and peripheral autonomic function in patients with subclinical chagasic cardiomyopathy. ET reduced MSNA and sympathetic activity in the heart and vessels and increased cardiac parasympathetic tone and baroreflex sensitivity. Regarding peripheral muscle, after 4 months, patients who underwent exercise training had an increased cross-sectional area of type I fibers and oxidative metabolism of muscle fibers, and decreased atrogin-1 gene expression, compared to participants who continued their activities as usual. In addition, the reduction in MSNA was associated with improved cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, reduced sympathetic cardiovascular tone, and reduced atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 gene expression.

The level of parasitemia is a known risk factor for congenital transmission. Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug of choice for preconceptional treatment to reduce parasitic load. The fear of treatment-related side effects limits the implementation of the Argentine guideline recommending BZN 60d/300 mg (or equivalent) treatment of T. cruzi seropositive women during the postpartum period to prevent transmission in a future pregnancy. A short and low dose BZN treatment might reduce major side effects and increase compliance, but its efficacy to reduce T. cruzi parasitic load compared to the standard 60d/300 mg course is not yet established. Clinical trials testing alternative BZN courses among women of reproductive age are urgently needed.
We are proposing to perform a double-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing a short low dose 30-day treatment with BZN 150 mg/day (30d/150 mg) vs. BZN 60d/300 mg.

The most important treatment options are nitroimidazole derivatives, such as nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). Some studies suggest that for adults seropositive to T. cruzi but without clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a simple fixed-dose scheme of BZN could be equivalent to a weight-adjusted dose. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of BZN with an adjusted dose for T. cruzi seropositive adults without CCC. We used the Cochrane methods, and reported according to the PRISMA statement. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to fixed and/or adjusted doses of BZN for T. cruzi seropositive adults without CCC. We searched (December 2019) Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and contacted Chagas experts. Selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane tool, were performed independently by pairs of reviewers. Discrepancies were solved by consensus within the team. Primary outcomes were parasite-related outcomes and efficacy or patient-related safety outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software and used GRADE summary of finding tables to present the certainty of evidence by outcome. We identified 655 records through our search strategy and 10 studies (four of them ongoing) met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any study directly comparing fixed vs adjusted doses of BZN, however, some outcomes allowed subgroup comparisons between fixed and adjusted doses of BZN against placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests no important subgroup differences for positive PCR at one year and for three safety outcomes (drug discontinuation, peripheral neuropathy, and mild rash). The same effect was observed for any serious adverse events (low-certainty evidence). All subgroups showed similar effects (I2 0% for all these subgroup comparisons but 32% for peripheral neuropathy), supporting the equivalence of BZN schemes. We conclude that there is no direct evidence comparing fixed and adjusted doses of BZN. Based on low to very low certainty of evidence for critical clinical outcomes and moderate certainty of evidence for important outcomes, fixed and adjusted doses may be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy. An individual patient data network meta-analysis could better address this issue.",,,,2020-08-18,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of methylprednisolone (MP) among hospitalized patients with suspected COVID-19.
A parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, Phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with clinical, epidemiological, and/or radiological suspected COVID-19 at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution) twice daily for 5 days. A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
From 18 April to 16 June 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 were randomized, and 393 were analyzed as mITT, with 194 individuals assigned to MP and 199 to placebo. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 81.3%. The mortality rates at Day 28 were not different between groups. A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years old in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at Day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until Day 7.

The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors. Extensive use of atazanavir (ATV) as antiretroviral and previous evidence suggesting its bioavailability within the respiratory tract prompted us to study this molecule against SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that ATV docks in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with greater strength than LPV, blocking Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells and a human pulmonary epithelial cell line. ATV/RTV also impaired virus-induced enhancement of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels.

The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. DESIGN: BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 34 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.

This review was performed according to the PICO format. The eligibility criteria comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that analyzed the adjunctive effect of OT on nonsurgical periodontal treatment.
Twelve studies published between 2010 and 2019 were included in this SR. A metaanalysis of ten reports showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the periodontal parameters analyzed when scaling and root planing (SRP) plus sulcus irrigation with ozonated water or sulcus insertion of ozonated gas were used when compared to SRP alone. Additionally, there was no significant difference when the effect of SRP plus ozonated water was compared with SRP plus 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CLX). No studies reported significant microbiological differences when the use of ozone was compared with SRP alone.
The results of this SR do not support the use of OT for nonsurgical periodontal treatment. However, due to the potential heterogeneity across the studies, the presence of confounding factors, and the short follow-up of some included RCTs, these results should not be considered definitive.

This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days).
Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.
Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).
The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

Early KS-PD and KS-IRIS were assessed in the A5264/AMC-067 trial in which participants with mild-to-moderate AIDS-KS were randomized to initiate ART with either immediate or as-needed oral etoposide. Early KS-PD was defined as tumor progression within 12 weeks of ART initiation. When investigators had concern that early KS-PD was KS-IRIS, additional evaluations were performed. Suspected KS-IRIS was defined as early KS-PD accompanied by a CD4 count increase of ≥50 cells per cubic millimeter or plasma HIV-1 RNA decrease of ≥0.5 log10 copies/mL. Clinical outcome was a composite end point categorized as failure, stable, and response at 48 and 96 weeks compared with baseline.

Experimental models have long been used to mimic features of ARDS pathophysiology, but the presence of distinct subphenotypes among preclinical ARDS remains unknown. This review will investigate whether: 1) subphenotypes can be identified among preclinical ARDS models; 2) such subphenotypes can identify some responsive traits.
We will include comparative preclinical (in vivo and ex vivo) ARDS studies published between 2009 and 2019 in which pre-specified therapies were assessed (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, stem cells, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, fibroblast growth factors, modulators of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products pathway, anticoagulants, and halogenated agents) and outcomes compared to a control condition. The primary outcome will be a composite of the four key features of preclinical ARDS as per the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar-capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction). Secondary outcomes will include the single components of the primary composite outcome, net alveolar fluid clearance, and death. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases will be searched electronically and data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models. Individual study reporting will be assessed according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Meta-regressions will be performed to identify subphenotypes prior to comparing outcomes across subphenotypes and treatment effects.
This study will inform on the presence and underlying pathophysiological features of subphenotypes among preclinical models of ARDS and should help to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to perform preclinical trials of subphenotype-targeted therapies, prior to potential clinical translation.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors classically prescribed in this setting can fail due to primary or acquired resistance or the necessity of drug withdrawal because of serious or moderate but chronic and deleterious adverse effects. Thus, the concept of redifferentiation strategy, which involves treating patients with one or more drugs capable of restoring radioiodine sensitivity for RAIR TC, has emerged. The area of redifferentiation strategy leads to the creation of new definitions of RAIR TC including persistent non radioiodine-avid patients and 'true' RAIR TC patients. The latter group presents a restored or increased radioiodine uptake in metastatic lesions but with no radiological response on conventional imaging, that is, progression of a metastatic disease, thus proving that they are 'truly' resistant to the radiation delivered by radioiodine. Unlike these patients, metastatic TC patients with restored radioiodine uptake offer the hope of prolonged remission or even cure of the disease as for radioiodine-avid metastatic TC. Here, we review the different redifferentiation strategies based on the underlying molecular mechanism leading to the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and radioiodine uptake reinduction, that is, by modulating signaling pathways, NIS transcription, NIS trafficking to the plasma membrane, NIS post-transcriptional regulation, by gene therapy and other potential strategies.

We report a multicenter study comprising patients from Latin America and Europe. Patients treated with sorafenib were enrolled; demographics, dose modifications, adverse events (AEs), treatment duration, and outcome of patients undergoing dialysis were recorded.
As of March 2018, 6156 HCC patients were treated in 44 centres and 22 patients were concomitantly under dialysis (0.36%). The median age was 65.5 years, 40.9% had hepatitis C, 75% had Child-Pugh A, and 85% were Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-C. The median time to first dose modification, treatment duration and overall survival rate were 2.4 months (interquartile ranges [IQR], 0.8-3.8), 10.8 months (IQR, 4.5-16.9), and 17.5 months (95% CI, 7.2-24.5), respectively. Seventeen patients required at least 1 dose modification. The main causes of first dose modification were asthenia/worsening of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status and diarrhoea.

In this study, we aimed to investigate optimal treatment strategies for advanced stage disease in areas of high prevalence and limited resources.
In this open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled people with HIV and advanced stage AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma attending 11 AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in Brazil, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) with a centralised computer system to receive either intravenous bleomycin and vincristine or oral etoposide (the investigational arms), or intravenous paclitaxel (the control arm), together with antiretroviral therapy (ART; combined efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and emtricitabine). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) at week 48, using a 15% non-inferiority margin to compare the investigational groups against the active control group. Safety was assessed in all eligible treated study participants. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01435018.
334 participants were enrolled between Oct 1, 2013, and March 8, 2018, when the study was closed early due to inferiority of the bleomycin and vincristine plus ART arm, as per the recommendations of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The etoposide plus ART arm also closed due to inferiority in March, 2016, following a DSMB recommendation. Week-48 PFS rates were higher in the paclitaxel plus ART arm than in both investigational arms. The absolute differences in PFS were -30% (95% CI -52 to -8) for the comparison of paclitaxel plus ART (week 48 PFS 50%, 32 to 67; n=59) and etoposide plus ART (20%, 6 to 33; n=59), and -20% (-33% to -7%) for the comparison of paclitaxel plus ART (64%, 55 to 73; n=138) and bleomycin and vincristine plus ART (44%, 35 to 53; n=132). Both CIs overlapped the non-inferiority margin. The most common adverse events, in 329 eligible participants who began treatment, were neutropenia (48 [15%]), low serum albumin (33 [10%]), weight loss (29 [9%]), and anaemia (28 [9%]), occurring at similar frequency across treatment arms.
Non-inferiority of either investigational intervention was not shown, with paclitaxel plus ART showing superiority to both oral etoposide plus ART and bleomycin and vincristine plus ART, supporting its use in treating advanced AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma in resource-limited settings.

32134952,Factors affecting the electrocardiographic QT interval in malaria: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data.,,PLoS medicine,"Electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation is the most widely used risk marker for ventricular arrhythmia potential and thus an important component of drug cardiotoxicity assessments. Several antimalarial medicines are associated with QT interval prolongation. However, interpretation of electrocardiographic changes is confounded by the coincidence of peak antimalarial drug concentrations with recovery from malaria. We therefore reviewed all available data to characterise the effects of malaria disease and demographic factors on the QT interval in order to improve assessment of electrocardiographic changes in the treatment and prevention of malaria.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data. We searched clinical bibliographic databases (last on August 21, 2017) for studies of the quinoline and structurally related antimalarials for malaria-related indications in human participants in which electrocardiograms were systematically recorded. Unpublished studies were identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) Evidence Review Group (ERG) on the Cardiotoxicity of Antimalarials. Risk of bias was assessed using the Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European Consortium (PROTECT) checklist for adverse drug events. Bayesian hierarchical multivariable regression with generalised additive models was used to investigate the effects of malaria and demographic factors on the pretreatment QT interval. The meta-analysis included 10,452 individuals (9,778 malaria patients, including 343 with severe disease, and 674 healthy participants) from 43 studies. 7,170 (68.6%) had fever (body temperature ≥ 37.5°C), and none developed ventricular arrhythmia after antimalarial treatment. Compared to healthy participants, patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria had shorter QT intervals (-61.77 milliseconds; 95% credible interval [CI]: -80.71 to -42.83) and increased sensitivity of the QT interval to heart rate changes. These effects were greater in severe malaria (-110.89 milliseconds; 95% CI: -140.38 to -81.25). Body temperature was associated independently with clinically significant QT shortening of 2.80 milliseconds (95% CI: -3.17 to -2.42) per 1°C increase. Study limitations include that it was not possible to assess the effect of other factors that may affect the QT interval but are not consistently collected in malaria clinical trials.
Adjustment for malaria and fever-recovery-related QT lengthening is necessary to avoid misattributing malaria-disease-related QT changes to antimalarial drug effects. This would improve risk assessments of antimalarial-related cardiotoxicity in clinical research and practice. Similar adjustments may be indicated for other febrile illnesses for which QT-interval-prolonging medications are important therapeutic options.",,,,2020-03-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Nonetheless, there are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating the role of this strategy.
We conducted this randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined epicardial ablation in patients with Chagas disease.
We randomized patients with Chagas disease and VT in a 1:1 fashion to either the endocardial (endo) mapping and ablation group or the combined endocardial/epicardial (endo/epi) mapping and ablation group. The efficacy end points were measured by VT inducibility and all-ventricular arrhythmia recurrence. Safety was assessed by the rate of periprocedural complications.
Thirty patients were enrolled, and most were male. The median age was 67 (Q1: 58; Q3: 70) years in the endo group and 58 (Q1: 43; Q3: 66) years in the endo/epi group. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 33.0% ± 9.5% and 35.2% ± 11.5%, respectively P = .13. Acute success (non-reinducibility of clinical VT) was obtained in 13 patients (86%) in the endo/epi group and in 6 patients (40%) in the endo-only group (P = .021). There were 12 patients with VT recurrence (80%) in the endo-only group and 6 patients (40%) in the endo/epi group (P = .02) (by intention-to-treat analysis). Epicardial ablation was ultimately performed in 9 patients (60%) in the endo-only group because of an absence of endocardial scar or maintenance of VT inducibility. There was no difference in complications between the groups.

Drugs and drug resistance,"Chagas disease (CD) is a tropical neglected illness, affecting mainly populations of low socioeconomic status in Latin America. An estimated 6 to 8 million people worldwide are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of CD. Despite being one of the main global health problems, this disease continues without effective treatment during the chronic phase of the infection. The limitation of therapeutic strategies has been one of the biggest challenges on the fight against CD. Nifurtimox and benznidazole, developed in the 1970s, are still the only commercial options with established efficacy on CD. However, the efficacy of these drugs have a proven efficacy only during early infection and the benefits in the chronic phase are questionable. Consequently, there is a growing need for new pharmacological alternatives, either by optimization of existing drugs or by the formulation of new compounds. In the present study, a literature review of the currently adopted therapy, its concomitant combination with other drugs, and potential future treatments for CD was performed, considering articles published from 2012. The revised articles were selected according to the protocol of treatment: evaluation of drug association, drug repositioning and research of new drugs. As a result of the present revision, it was possible to conclude that the use of benznidazole in combination with other compounds showed better results when compared with its use as a single therapy. The search of new drugs has been the strategy most used in pursuing more effective forms of treatment for CD.

Inhibitors of the mammalian homologue cathepsin C have been used in clinical trials as potential drugs to treat chronic inflammatory disorders, thus proving that these enzymes are druggable. In Plasmodium species, DPAPs play important functions at different stages of parasite development, thus making them potential antimalarial targets. Most DPAP inhibitors developed to date are peptide-based or peptidomimetic competitive inhibitors. Here, we used a high throughput screening approach to identify novel inhibitor scaffolds that block the activity of Plasmodium falciparum DPAP1. Most of the hits identified in this screen also inhibit Plasmodium falciparum DPAP3, cathepsin C, and to a lesser extent other malarial clan CA proteases, indicating that these might be general DPAP inhibitors. Interestingly, our mechanism of inhibition studies indicate that most hits are allosteric inhibitors, which opens a completely new strategy to inhibit these enzymes, study their biological function, and potentially develop new inhibitors as starting points for drug development.",,,,2019-12-19,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, has been shown to improve the histological features of NASH. Here we report results from a planned interim analysis of an ongoing, phase 3 study of obeticholic acid for NASH.
In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adult patients with definite NASH, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score of at least 4, and fibrosis stages F2-F3, or F1 with at least one accompanying comorbidity, were randomly assigned using an interactive web response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive oral placebo, obeticholic acid 10 mg, or obeticholic acid 25 mg daily. Patients were excluded if cirrhosis, other chronic liver disease, elevated alcohol consumption, or confounding conditions were present. The primary endpoints for the month-18 interim analysis were fibrosis improvement (≥1 stage) with no worsening of NASH, or NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis, with the study considered successful if either primary endpoint was met. Primary analyses were done by intention to treat, in patients with fibrosis stage F2-F3 who received at least one dose of treatment and reached, or would have reached, the month 18 visit by the prespecified interim analysis cutoff date. The study also evaluated other histological and biochemical markers of NASH and fibrosis, and safety. This study is ongoing, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02548351, and EudraCT, 20150-025601-6.
Between Dec 9, 2015, and Oct 26, 2018, 1968 patients with stage F1-F3 fibrosis were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment; 931 patients with stage F2-F3 fibrosis were included in the primary analysis (311 in the placebo group, 312 in the obeticholic acid 10 mg group, and 308 in the obeticholic acid 25 mg group). The fibrosis improvement endpoint was achieved by 37 (12%) patients in the placebo group, 55 (18%) in the obeticholic acid 10 mg group (p=0·045), and 71 (23%) in the obeticholic acid 25 mg group (p=0·0002). The NASH resolution endpoint was not met (25 [8%] patients in the placebo group, 35 [11%] in the obeticholic acid 10 mg group [p=0·18], and 36 [12%] in the obeticholic acid 25 mg group [p=0·13]). In the safety population (1968 patients with fibrosis stages F1-F3), the most common adverse event was pruritus (123 [19%] in the placebo group, 183 [28%] in the obeticholic acid 10 mg group, and 336 [51%] in the obeticholic acid 25 mg group); incidence was generally mild to moderate in severity. The overall safety profile was similar to that in previous studies, and incidence of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups (75 [11%] patients in the placebo group, 72 [11%] in the obeticholic acid 10 mg group, and 93 [14%] in the obeticholic acid 25 mg group).
Obeticholic acid 25 mg significantly improved fibrosis and key components of NASH disease activity among patients with NASH. The results from this planned interim analysis show clinically significant histological improvement that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.

We hypothesised that ART containing either efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir would alter plasma concentrations of vaginally administered etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol but that ART concentrations would be unchanged during use of an intravaginal ring.
We did a parallel, three-group, pharmacokinetic evaluation at HIV clinics in Asia (two sites), South America (five), sub-Saharan Africa (three), and the USA (11) between Dec 30, 2014, and Sept 12, 2016. We enrolled women with HIV who were either ART-naive (control group; n=25), receiving efavirenz-based ART (n=25), or receiving atazanavir-ritonavir-based ART (n=24). Women receiving ART were required to be on the same regimen for at least 30 days, with 400 copies or less per mL of plasma HIV-1 RNA; women not receiving ART had CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or less. We excluded participants who had a bilateral oophorectomy or conditions that were contraindicated in the intravaginal ring product labelling. An intravaginal ring releasing etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol was inserted at entry (day 0). Single plasma samples for hormone concentrations were collected on days 7, 14, and 21 after intravaginal ring insertion. The primary outcome was the plasma concentration of etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol on day 21. Etonogestrel and ethinylestradiol concentrations were compared between each ART group and the control group by geometric mean ratio (GMR) with 90% CIs and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. As secondary outcomes, efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir concentrations were assessed by 8-h intensive pharmacokinetic sampling at entry before intravaginal ring insertion and before intravaginal ring removal on day 21. Antiretroviral areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC
Between Dec 30, 2014, and Sept 12, 2016, we enrolled 84 participants in the study; ten participants were excluded from the primary hormone analysis. 74 participants met the primary endpoint: 25 in the control group, 25 in the efavirenz group, and 24 in the atazanavir group. On day 21 of intravaginal ring use, participants receiving efavirenz had 79% lower etonogestrel (GMR 0·21, 90% CI 0·16-0·28; p<0·0001) and 59% lower ethinylestradiol (0·41, 0·32-0·52; p<0·0001) concentrations compared with the control group. By contrast, participants receiving ritonavir-boosted atazanavir had 71% higher etonogestrel (1·71, 1·37-2·14; p<0·0001), yet 38% lower ethinylestradiol (0·62, 0·49-0·79; p=0·0037) compared with the control group. The AUC
Hormone exposure was significantly lower when an intravaginal ring contraceptive was combined with efavirenz-based ART. Further studies designed to examine pharmacodynamic endpoints, such as ovulation, when intravaginal ring hormones are combined with efavirenz are warranted.

31493004,Red blood cells microparticles are associated with hemolysis markers and may contribute to clinical events among sickle cell disease patients.,"Clinical manifestations, Hemolysis, Red blood cells microparticles, Sickle cell disease",Annals of hematology,"Microparticles are sub-micron vesicles possessing protein and other materials derived from the plasma membrane of their parent cells, and literature suggests that they may have a role in the pathophysiology and downstream manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD). The contributions of red blood cells microparticles (RMP) to the pathogenic mechanisms and clinical phenotypes of SCD are largely unknown. There is a controversy as to whether the proportions of intravascular hemolysis (approximately ≤ 30% of total hemolysis) would be enough to explain some complications seen in patients with SCD. We investigated RMP among 138 SCD patients and 39 HbAA individuals. Plasma RMPs were quantified by flow cytometry, plasma hemoglobin and heme by colorimetric assays, and haptoglobin and hemopexin by ELISA. The patients had higher RMP, plasma hemoglobin, and heme compared to the controls. On the contrary, haptoglobin and hemopexin were depleted in the patients. The RMP correlated positively with heme, lactate dehydrogenase, plasma hemoglobin, serum bilirubin, reticulocyte counts, and tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity of the patients. Contrarily, it correlated negatively with HbF, hemopexin, red blood cells counts, hemoglobin concentration, and haptoglobin. Although patients treated with hydroxyurea had lower RMP, this did not attain statistical significance. Patients with sickle leg ulcer and elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity had higher levels of RMP. In conclusion, these data suggest that RMPs are associated with hemolysis and may have important roles in the pathophysiology and downstream complications of SCD.",,,,2019-09-08,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Despite an improved understanding of molecular mechanisms and advances in supportive care strategies, ARDS remains associated with high mortality, and survivors usually face long-term morbidity. In recent years, preclinical studies have provided mounting evidence of the potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses. In several models of ARDS, MSCs have been demonstrated to induce anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, improve epithelial and endothelial cell recovery, and enhance microbial and alveolar fluid clearance, thus resulting in improved lung and distal organ function and survival. Early-stage clinical trials have also demonstrated the safety of MSC administration in patients with ARDS, but further, large-scale investigations are required to assess the safety and efficacy profile of these therapies. In this review, we summarize the main mechanisms whereby MSCs have been shown to exert therapeutic effects in experimental ARDS. We also highlight questions that need to be further elucidated and barriers that must be overcome in order to efficiently translate MSC research into clinical practice.",,,,2019-09-06,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Currently available drugs have limited efficacy and induce serious side effects. Thus, the discovery of new drugs is urgently needed in the fight against Chagas' disease. Here, we synthesized and evaluated the biological effect of pyrazole-imidazoline (1a-i) and pyrazole-tetrahydropyrimidine (2a-i) derivatives against relevant clinical forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. The structure-activity relationship (SAR), drug-target search, physicochemical and ADMET properties of the major active compounds in vitro were also assessed in silico. Pyrazole derivatives showed no toxicity in Vero cells and also no cardiotoxicity. Phenotypic screening revealed two dichlorinated pyrazole-imidazoline derivatives (1c and 1d) with trypanocidal activity higher than that of benznidazole (Bz) against trypomastigotes; these were also the most potent compounds against intracellular amastigotes. Replacement of imidazoline with tetrahydropyrimidine in the pyrazole compounds completely abolished the trypanocidal activity of series 2(a-i) derivatives. The physicochemical and ADMET properties of the compounds predicted good permeability, good oral bioavailability, no toxicity and mutagenicity of 1c and 1d. Pyrazole nucleus had high frequency hits for cruzipain in drug-target search and structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis of pyrazole-imidazoline derivatives revealed enhanced activity when chlorine atom was inserted in meta-positions of the benzene ring. Additionally, we found evidence that both compounds (1c and 1d) have the potential to interact non-covalently with the active site of cruzipain and also inhibit the cysteine proteinase activity of T. cruzi. Collectively, the data presented here reveal pyrazole derivatives with promise for further optimization in the therapy of Chagas disease.",,,,2019-08-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
31433828,Detection of Trypanosoma cruzi by PCR in adults with chronic Chagas disease treated with nifurtimox.,,PloS one,"Chagas disease, a vector-borne parasitosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic to Latin America and has spread to other countries due to immigration of infected persons. It is estimated that 160,000 people are infected in Chile, most of them in the chronic phase and without etiological treatment. The infection is confirmed by conventional serological methods while molecular methods have become in valuable tools to evaluate parasitemia in treated and non-treated chronic Chagas disease patients. The objective of this study was to determine, by conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction, the presence of T. cruzi kinetoplastid DNA in peripheral blood samples from 114 adult individuals with confirmed chronic Chagas disease, before and 6.6 years (average) after treatment with nifurtimox. The samples were received and preserved in guanidine-EDTA until DNA purification. Conventional PCR assays were performed in triplicate with T. cruzi kinetoplastid DNA primers 121 and 122. The amplified products were fractionated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. A 330 bp product represented a positive assay. 84.2% (96 cases) and 6.1% (7 cases) of the samples taken before and after the treatment, respectively, were positive. The McNemar test showed a statistically significant difference between the groups of samples (p<0.001). Since serological negativization (the current cure criterion) delay many years after therapy and positive parasitological results represent a treatment failure, the conversion of pre-therapy positive conventional PCR is a qualitative and complementary tool that could be included in protocols of prolonged follow-up.",,,,2019-08-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

NF is safe and effective for paediatric and adult Chagas disease. We evaluated the degree of NF transfer into breast milk in lactating women with Chagas disease.
Prospective study of a cohort of lactating women with Chagas disease. Patients were treated with NF for 1 month. NF was measured in plasma and milk by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Breastfed infants were evaluated at admission, 7th and 30th day of treatment (and monthly thereafter, for 6 months).
Lactating women with chronic Chagas disease (N = 10) were enrolled (median age 28 years, range 17-36). Median NF dose was 9.75 mg/kg/day three times a day (TID). Six mothers had mild adverse drug reactions (ADRs), but no ADRs were observed in any of the breastfed infants. No interruption of breastfeeding was observed. Median NF concentrations were 2.15 mg/L (Inter quartil range (IQR) 1.32-4.55) in milk and 0.30 mg/L (IQR 0.20-0.95) in plasma. Median NF milk/plasma ratio was 16 (range 8.75-30.25). Median relative infant NF dose (assuming a daily breastmilk intake of 150 mL/kg/day) was 6.7% of the maternal dose/kg/day (IQR 2.35-7.19%).
The low concentrations of NF in breast milk and the normal clinical evaluation of the breastfed babies imply that maternal NF treatment for Chagas disease during breastfeeding is unlikely to lead to clinically relevant exposures in the breastfed infants.

31376368,Role of nucleic acid amplification assays in monitoring treatment response in chagas disease: Usefulness in clinical trials.,"Chronic chagas disease, Clinical trials, Drug resistance, Quantitative real time PCR, Treatment monitoring, Trypanosoma cruzi",Acta tropica,"Chagas disease has become a global health problem due to migration of infected people out of Latin America to non-endemic countries. For more than 40 years, only the nitroimidazole compounds Benznidazole and Nifurtimox, have been used for specific treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection with disappointing results, specially due to the long duration of treatment and adverse events in the chronic phase. In the last years, ergosterol inhibitors have been also proposed for specific treatment. Different randomized clinical trials were performed for evaluating their treatment efficacy and safety. One of the greatest concerns in clinical trials is to provide an early surrogate biomarker of response to trypanocidal chemotherapy. Serological response is slow and the classical parasitological tests have poor sensitivity and are time-consuming. Nowadays, PCR is the most helpful tool for assessing treatment response in a short period of time. Different protocols of PCR have been developed, being quantitative real time PCR based on amplification of repetitive satellite or minicircle DNA sequences plus an internal amplification standard, the mostly employed strategies in clinical trials. Standardized protocols and the use of an external quality assessment ensure adequate technical procedures and reliable data. Clinical trials have shown a significant reduction in parasite loads, reaching undetectable DNA levels in bloodstream after specific treatment, however events of treatment failure have also been reported. Treatment failure could be due to inadequate penetrance of the drugs into the affected tissues, to the presence of primary or secondary drug resistance of the infecting strains as well as to the existence of dormant parasite variants reluctant to drug action. The early diagnosis of drug resistance would improve clinical management of Chagas disease patients, allowing dictating alternative therapies with a combination of existing drugs or new anti-T. cruzi agents. The aim of this review was to describe the usefulness of detecting T.cruzi DNA by means of real time PCR assays, as surrogate biomarker in clinical trials for evaluating new drugs for CD or new regimens of available drugs and the possibility to detect treatment failure.",,,,2019-08-04,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
31371262,Third-line antiretroviral therapy in low-income and middle-income countries (ACTG A5288): a prospective strategy study.,,The lancet. HIV,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) management is challenging for individuals in resource-limited settings presenting for third-line treatment because of complex resistance patterns, partly due to reduced access to viral load monitoring. We aimed to evaluate use of newer antiretroviral drugs and contemporary management approaches, including population-based sequencing, to select appropriate antiretrovirals, plasma viral load monitoring, and interventions to improve adherence in individuals presenting with second-line viral failure.
A5288 was a phase 4, third-line ART strategy study done at 19 urban sites in ten countries that enrolled adult participants with confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA (viral load) of 1000 copies per mL or more after more than 24 weeks of protease inhibitor-based second-line ART. The primary objective was to use antiretrovirals (raltegravir, etravirine, and ritonavir-boosted darunavir) and diagnostic monitoring technologies, including viral load, genotyping, and adherence support to achieve viral load suppression (defined as ≤200 copies per mL) in 65% or more of participants. ART history and real-time drug resistance genotypes were used to assign participants to one of four cohorts: cohort A (no lopinavir resistance) stayed on second-line ART and cohorts B (B1, best available nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus ritonavir-boosted darunavir plus raltegravir; B2, ritonavir-boosted darunavir plus raltegravir plus etravirine; B3, ritonavir-boosted darunavir, raltegravir, and either tenofovir plus emtricitabine or tenofovir plus lamivudine), C (ritonavir-boosted darunavir plus raltegravir plus tenofovir-emtricitabine or tenofovir plus lamivudine), and D (best available NRTIs plus ritonavir-boosted darunavir plus raltegravir) were defined by increasing levels of resistance and received appropriate regimens, including new antiretrovirals. Participants in Cohort B without detectable hepatitis B surface antigen were assigned by blocked randomisation to cohorts B1 and B2, and those with detectable hepatitis B surface antigen were assigned to cohort B3. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01641367.
From Jan 10, 2013, to Sept 10, 2015, 545 participants were enrolled. 287 (53%) were assigned to cohort A, 74 (14%) to B1, 72 (13%) to B2, eight (1%) to B3, 70 (13%) to C, and 34 (6%) to D. Overall, 349 (64%, 95% CI 60-68) participants achieved viral suppression at week 48, with proportions varying from 125 (44%) of 287 in cohort A to 65 (88%) of 74 in cohort B1, 63 (88%) of 72 in B2, eight (100%) of eight in B3, 63 (90%) of 70 in C, and 25 (74%) of 34 in D. Participants in cohort A remained on their second-line protease inhibitor, and had the most participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events (147 [51%]).
Targeted real-time genotyping to select third-line ART can appropriately allocate more costly antiretrovirals to those with greater levels of HIV drug resistance.

Overt Chagas heart disease is an ominous condition, occurring in 20-30% of infected individuals, which has besides the persistent myocarditis a peculiar intracardiac ganglionic neuronal depletion and dysautonomy. This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of renal denervation for patients with advanced symptomatic Chagas cardiomyopathy.
Open-label prospective pilot study that randomized patients with Chagas heart disease to either renal denervation or conservative treatment (2:1 ratio). The primary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse events at 9 months, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, need for renal artery invasive treatment, or worsening renal function.

Nonetheless, supportive data from randomised trials is limited to individuals treated with BZN in southern cone countries of Latin America.
The goal of this randomised, concealed, blind, parallel-group trial is to inform the trypanocidal efficacy and safety of NFX and its equivalence to BZN among individuals with T. cruzi positive serology (TC+). Eligible individuals are TC+, 20-65 years old, with no apparent symptoms/signs or uncontrolled risk factors for cardiomyopathy and at negligible risk of re-infection. Consenting individuals (adherent to a 10-day placebo run-in phase) receive a 120-day BID blinded treatment with NFX, BZN or matching placebo (2:2:1 ratio). The four active medication arms include (1) a randomly allocated sequence of 60-day, conventional-dose (60CD) regimes (BZN 300 mg/day or NFX 480 mg/day, ratio 1:1), followed or preceded by a 60-day placebo treatment, or (2) 120-day half-dose (120HD) regimes (BZN 150 mg/day or NFX 240 mg/day, ratio 1:1). The primary efficacy outcome is the proportion of participants testing positive at least once for up to three polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (1 + PCR) 12-18 months after randomisation. A composite safety outcome includes moderate to severe adverse reactions, consistent blood marker abnormalities or treatment abandons. The trial outside Colombia (expected to recruit at least 60% of participants) is pragmatic; it may be open-label and not include all treatment groups, but it must adhere to the randomisation and data administration system and guarantee a blinded efficacy outcome evaluation. Our main comparisons include NFX groups with placebo (for superiority), NFX versus BZN groups and 60CD versus 120HD groups (for non-inferiority) and testing for the agent-dose and group-region interactions. Assuming a 1 + PCR ≥ 75% in the placebo group, up to 25% among BZN-treated and an absolute difference of up to ≥ 25% with NFX to claim its trypanocidal effect, 60-80 participants per group (at least 300 from Colombia) are needed to test our hypotheses (80-90% power; one-sided alpha level 1%).
The EQUITY trial will inform the trypanocidal effect and equivalence of nitroderivative agents NFX and BZN, particularly outside southern cone countries. Its results may challenge current recommendations and inform choices for these agents.

In addition to the biosynthetic routes of amino acids, T. cruzi possesses transport systems that allow the active uptake from the extracellular medium; and in the case of polyamines, the uptake is the unique way to obtain these compounds. The TcAAAP protein family is absent in mammals and its members are responsible for amino acid and derivative uptake, thus the TcAAAP permeases are not only interesting and promising therapeutic targets but could also be used to direct the entry of toxic compounds into the parasite. Although there is a treatment available for Chagas disease, its limited efficacy in the chronic stage of the disease, as well as the side effects reported, highlight the urgent need to develop new therapies. Discovery of new drugs is a slow and cost-consuming process, and even during clinical trials the drugs can fail.

30998741,Detection of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies by chimeric antigens in chronic Chagas disease-individuals from endemic South American countries.,,PloS one,"Laboratory diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is a troubling factor due to lack of reference tests. The WHO suggests the use of two distinct commercial serological tests in parallel. The performance of commercial immunoassays might fluctuate depending on the antigenic matrices and the local strains of T. cruzi in different geographical settings. The use of antigenic matrices based on chimeric proteins can solve these limitations. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of two chimeric T. cruzi antigens (IBMP-8.1 and -8.4) to diagnose chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries.
IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and purified using chromatography methods. Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house ELISA with sera from 122 non-infected and 215 T. cruzi-infected individuals from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Cut-off values were based on ROC curves and performance parameters were determined using a dichotomous approach. Area under the curve values were > 99.7% for both IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 antigens. IgG levels in T. cruzi-positive and negative samples were higher for IBMP-8.4 than IBMP-8.1. Both IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 were 100% specific, while IBMP-8.4 were 100% sensitive compared to IBMP-8.1 (95.3%). Admitting RI values of 1.0 ± 0.10 as the inconclusive interval, 6.2% of the samples tested using IBMP-8.1 and 2.1% using IBMP-8.4 fell inside the grey zone. Based on accuracy and diagnostic odds ratio values, IBMP-8.4 presented the best performance. Differences in sensitivity and IgG levels among the samples from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay were not significant.

There is limited evidence on the willingness of MDR-TB HHCs to take MDR-TB preventive therapy (MDR TPT) to decrease their risk of TB disease.
In this cross-sectional study of HHCs of MDR-TB and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) index cases from 16 clinical research sites in 8 countries, enrollees were interviewed to assess willingness to take a hypothetical, newly developed MDR TPT if offered. To identify factors associated with willingness to take MDR TPT, a marginal logistic model was fitted using generalized estimating equations to account for household-level clustering.
From 278 MDR-TB/RR-TB index case households, 743 HHCs were enrolled; the median age of HHCs was 33 (interquartile range, 22-49) years, and 62% were women. HHC willingness to take hypothetical MDR TPT was high (79%) and remained high even with the potential for mild side effects (70%). Increased willingness was significantly associated with current employment or schooling (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.83 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.07-3.13]), appropriate TB-related knowledge (aOR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.23-3.99]), confidence in taking MDR TPT (aOR, 7.16 [95% CI, 3.33-15.42]), and being comfortable telling others about taking MDR TPT (aOR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.29-4.06]).
The high percentage of HHCs of MDR-TB/RR-TB index cases willing to take hypothetical MDR TPT provides important evidence for the potential uptake of effective MDR TPT when implemented.

30855114,Metal Compounds in the Development of Antiparasitic Agents: Rational Design from Basic Chemistry to the Clinic.,,Metal ions in life sciences,"Metal compounds seem to be a promising approach in the search of new therapeutic solutions for neglected tropical diseases. In this chapter, efforts in the design of prospective metal-based drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis are discussed. Careful selection of the metal center (including organometallic cores) and the types and number of coordinated ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of the complexes and hence, tuning their biological properties. In a target-based approach, some targets that have been validated for organic antiparasitic compounds are expected to remain targets for metal complexes of these compounds. In addition, specific targets for metal compounds, like parasitic enzymes or DNA, would also be included for these metal complexes leading to potential additive or even synergistic effects between organic ligand and metal ion. However, even though a good number of prospective antiparasitic metal-based drugs have been developed, further systematic efforts are needed for these metal compounds to accomplish the regulatory guidelines that let them reach the different stages of clinical trials.",,,,2019-03-12,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
30807605,"The fecal, oral, and skin microbiota of children with Chagas disease treated with benznidazole.",,PloS one,"Chagas disease is still prevalent in rural areas of South America. In endemic areas of Bolivia, school children are screened for the program of Chagas disease eradication of the Ministry of Health, and positive children are treated. Here, we compared the fecal, oral and skin microbiomes of children with or without Chagas disease, and before and after benznidazol treatment of infected children.
A total of 543 Bolivian children (5-14 years old) were tested for Chagas disease, and 20 positive children were treated with Benznidazole. Fecal samples and oral and skin swabs were obtained before and after treatment, together with samples from a group of 35 uninfected controls. The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and analyzed using QIIME to determine Alpha diversity differences and community distances, and linear discriminant analyses to determine marker taxa by infection status or treatment.
Twenty out of 543 children screened were seropositive for Chagas disease (3.7%) and were included in the study, together with 35 control children that were seronegative for the disease. Fecal samples, oral and skin swabs were taken at the beginning of the study and after the anti-protozoa therapy with Benznidazole to the chagasic children. Infected children had higher fecal Firmicutes (Streptococcus, Roseburia, Butyrivibrio, and Blautia), and lower Bacteroides and also showed some skin -but not oral- microbiota differences. Treatment eliminated the fecal microbiota differences from control children, increasing Dialister (class Clostridia) and members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and decreasing Prevotella and Coprococcus, with minor effects on the oral and skin bacterial diversity.
The results of this study show differences in the fecal microbiota associated with Chagas disease in children, and also evidence that treatment normalizes fecal microbiota (makes it more similar to that in controls), but is associated with oral and skin microbiota differences from control children. Since microbiota impacts in children, it is important to determine the effect of drugs on the children microbiota, since dysbiosis could lead to physiological effects which might be avoidable with microbiota restoration interventions.",,"Twenty out of 543 children screened were seropositive for Chagas disease (3.7%) and were included in the study, together with 35 control children that were seronegative for the disease.

Approximately 30% of the cases evolve to the chronic symptomatic stage due to cardiac and/or digestive damage, generally accompanied by nervous system impairment. Given the higher frequency and severity of clinical manifestations related to cardiac tissue lesion, the goal of this study was the identification of proteins associated with the disease progression towards its cardiac form. Thus, T. cruzi bloodstream trypomastigotes proteins were submitted to immunoprecipitation using antibodies from patients with the asymptomatic or cardiac (stages B1 and C) forms of the disease and from healthy donors as control. Immunoreactive proteins were identified and quantified based on mass spectrometry analysis and shifts in the recognition profile were further evaluated. Compared to asymptomatic samples, IgG from stage C patients predominantly detected the I/6 autoantigen, whereas IgG from B1 patients resulted in higher yield of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase precursor, calpain cysteine peptidase, and two variants of CAP5.5. In this work, CAP5.5 recognition by serum immunoglobulin from patients with early cardiomyopathy generated a 23-fold abundance variation when compared to samples from asymptomatic patients, highlighting the participation of this protein in cardiac form progression of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE: While T. cruzi has become the major cause of infectious cardiomyopathy in Latin America, research groups have been struggling to find alternative treatment, vaccine candidates, and improved diagnostic tests. In addition, the absence of adequate biomarkers to assess cure and progression of disease is a major setback for clinical trials and patients monitoring. Therefore, our findings may contribute to a better understanding of T. cruzi pathogenesis and evaluation of suitable candidates for vaccine and diagnostic tests, besides the clinical applicability of the potential biomarkers for patient follow-up and prognosis. Finally, the identification of T. cruzi proteins recognized by IgG from healthy donors may contribute for the understanding and discovery of epitope conservation among a broad range of pathogens.",,,,2018-12-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

It is most common in Central and South America, where Chagas disease is endemic. In addition to the infectious etiology, achalasia can be idiopathic, autoimmune, or drug induced. It is an incurable, progressive condition that destroys the intramural nerve plexus, causing aperistalsis of the esophageal body and impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The literature on the treatment of achalasia comparing pneumatic dilation (PD) and laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM) shows conflicting results. Therefore, a systemic review and meta-analysis are needed. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of PD and LHM, based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommendations, was presented. The primary outcome was symptom remission based on the Eckardt score. Secondary outcomes were lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and perforation. A total of four studies were included in this analysis. The total number of patients was 404. Posttreatment symptom remission rates did not differ significantly between LHM and PD at 2 years (RD = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.12], P = 0.62), or 5 years (RD = 0.13, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.39], P = 0.32).

Heart failure, sudden death and cardioembolic stroke are the main mechanisms of death in Chagas heart disease. The impact of specific etiologic treatment on the prognosis of patients with chronic Chagas heart disease is very limited regardless of the presence or absence of heart failure. Patients with symptomatic Chagas heart disease present serum selenium (Se) levels lower than patients without Chagas heart disease. Moreover, Se supplementation in animal models showed promising results. The aim of this trial is to estimate the effect of Se treatment on prevention of heart disease progression in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. However, we had to introduce some protocol modifications in order to keep trial feasibility, as follows: the primary outcome was restricted to left ventricular ejection fraction as a continuous variable, excluding disease progression; the follow-up period was decreased from 5 years to 1 year, an adjustment that might increase the participation rate of our study; the superior age limit was increased from 65 to 75 years; and diabetes mellitus was no longer considered an exclusion criterion.

However, because DNA and nucleic acid vaccines produce less than optimal responses in humans, our strategy relies on administering a recombinant protein-based vaccine, together with adjuvants that promote Th1-type immunity. Here we describe a process for the purification and refolding of recombinant TSA-1 expressed in Escherichia coli. The overall yield (20-25%) and endotoxin level of the purified recombinant TSA-1 (rTSA-1) is suitable for pilot scale production of the antigen for use in phase 1 clinical trials. Mice infected with T. cruzi were treated with rTSA-1, either alone or with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) agonist adjuvants including monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA, IDRI), and E6020 (EISEI, Inc). TSA-1 with the TLR-4 agonists was effective at reducing parasitemia relative to rTSA-1 alone, although it was difficult to discern a therapeutic effect compared to treatment with TLR-4 agonists alone. However, rTSA-1 with a 10 ug dose of MPLA optimized reductions in cardiac tissue inflammation, which were significantly reduced compared to MPLA alone.

30148839,"Application of Venn's diagram in the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis using IFN-γ, IP-10 and adenosine deaminase.",,PloS one,"Pleural tuberculosis (PlTB) is the most common extrapulmonary manifestation of this infectious disease which still presents high mortality rates worldwide. Conventional diagnostic tests for PlTB register multiple limitations, including the lack of sensitivity of microbiological methods on pleural specimens and the need of invasive procedures such as pleural biopsy performance. In this scenario, the search for biological markers on pleural fluid (PF) has been the target of several studies as a strategy to overcome the limitations of PlTB diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the use either isolated or in combination with adenosine deaminase (ADA), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interferon-gamma inducible protein of 10-kD (IP-10) levels on PF in order to guide an accurate anti-TB treatment in microbiologically non-confirmed cases.
Eighty patients presenting pleural effusion under investigation were enrolled in a cross-sectional study conducted at Pedro Ernesto University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. Peripheral blood (PB) and PF samples collected from all patients were applied to the commercial IFN-γ release assay, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and samples were analyzed for IFN-γ and IP-10 by immunoassays. ADA activity was determined on PF by the colorimetric method. Based on microbiological and histological criteria, patients were categorized as follow: confirmed PlTB (n = 16), non-confirmed PlTB (n = 17) and non-PlTB (n = 47). The Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-specific production of IFN-γ and IP-10 on PB or PF did not show significant differences. However, the basal levels of these biomarkers, as well as the ADA activity on PF, were significantly increased in confirmed PlTB in comparison to non-PlTB group. Receiver operating characteristics curves were performed and the best cut-off points of these three biomarkers were estimated. Their either isolated or combined performances (sensitivity [Se], specificity [Sp], positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV] and accuracy [Acc]) were determined and applied to Venn's diagrams among the groups. Based on the confirmed PlTB cases, IFN-γ showed the best performance of them at a cut-off point of 2.33 IU/mL (Se = 93.8% and Sp = 97.9%) followed by ADA at a cut-off of 25.80 IU/L (Se = 100% and Sp = 84.8%) and IP-10 (Cut-point = 4,361.90 pg/mL, Se = 75% and Sp = 82.6%). IFN-γ plus ADA (cut-point: 25.80 IU/L) represent the most accurate biomarker combination (98.4%), showing Se = 93.7%, Sp = 100%, PPV = 100% and NPV = 97.9%. When this analysis was applied in non-confirmed PlTB, 15/17 (88.2%) presented at least two positive biomarkers in combination.
IFN-γ, IP-10, and ADA in PlTB effusions are significantly higher than in non-PlTB cases. IFN-γ is an excellent rule-in and rule-out test compared to IP-10 and ADA. The combination of IFN-γ and ADA, in a reviewed cut-off point, showed to be particularly useful to clinicians as their positive results combined prompts immediate treatment for TB while both negative results suggest further investigation.",,,"IFN-γ, IP-10, and ADA in PlTB effusions are significantly higher than in non-PlTB cases.

30067931,Four Months of Rifampin or Nine Months of Isoniazid for Latent Tuberculosis in Adults.,,The New England journal of medicine,"A 9-month regimen of isoniazid can prevent active tuberculosis in persons with latent tuberculosis infection. However, the regimen has been associated with poor adherence rates and with toxic effects.
In an open-label trial conducted in nine countries, we randomly assigned adults with latent tuberculosis infection to receive treatment with a 4-month regimen of rifampin or a 9-month regimen of isoniazid for the prevention of confirmed active tuberculosis within 28 months after randomization. Noninferiority and potential superiority were assessed. Secondary outcomes included clinically diagnosed active tuberculosis, adverse events of grades 3 to 5, and completion of the treatment regimen. Outcomes were adjudicated by independent review panels.
Among the 3443 patients in the rifampin group, confirmed active tuberculosis developed in 4 and clinically diagnosed active tuberculosis developed in 4 during 7732 person-years of follow-up, as compared with 4 and 5 patients, respectively, among 3416 patients in the isoniazid group during 7652 person-years of follow-up. The rate differences (rifampin minus isoniazid) were less than 0.01 cases per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.14 to 0.16) for confirmed active tuberculosis and less than 0.01 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI, -0.23 to 0.22) for confirmed or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis. The upper boundaries of the 95% confidence interval for the rate differences of the confirmed cases and for the confirmed or clinically diagnosed cases of tuberculosis were less than the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.75 percentage points in cumulative incidence; the rifampin regimen was not superior to the isoniazid regimen. The difference in the treatment-completion rates was 15.1 percentage points (95% CI, 12.7 to 17.4).

Infectious diseases,"Chloroquine remains the mainstay of treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria despite increasing reports of treatment failure. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of chloroquine dose and the addition of primaquine on the risk of recurrent vivax malaria across different settings.
A systematic review done in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews identified P vivax clinical trials published between Jan 1, 2000, and March 22, 2017. Principal investigators were invited to share individual patient data, which were pooled using standardised methods. Cox regression analyses with random effects for study site were used to investigate the roles of chloroquine dose and primaquine use on rate of recurrence between day 7 and day 42 (primary outcome). The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO, number CRD42016053310.
Of 134 identified chloroquine studies, 37 studies (from 17 countries) and 5240 patients were included. 2990 patients were treated with chloroquine alone, of whom 1041 (34·8%) received a dose below the target 25 mg/kg. The risk of recurrence was 32·4% (95% CI 29·8-35·1) by day 42. After controlling for confounders, a 5 mg/kg higher chloroquine dose reduced the rate of recurrence overall (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·69-0·97; p=0·021) and in children younger than 5 years (0·59, 0·41-0·86; p=0·0058). Adding primaquine reduced the risk of recurrence to 4·9% (95% CI 3·1-7·7) by day 42, which is lower than with chloroquine alone (AHR 0·10, 0·05-0·17; p<0·0001).
Chloroquine is commonly under-dosed in the treatment of vivax malaria. Increasing the recommended dose to 30 mg/kg in children younger than 5 years could reduce substantially the risk of early recurrence when primaquine is not given. Radical cure with primaquine was highly effective in preventing early recurrence and may also improve blood schizontocidal efficacy against chloroquine-resistant P vivax.

However, it is toxic and of limited value in chronic infection.
We aimed to estimate the rates of and factors related to adverse reactions (ARs) to benznidazole and treatment discontinuations (TDs).
A meta-analysis was performed using an electronic search of the published literature with no language restrictions until June 2017. Prospective studies were included of chronically infected patients in which at least one treatment arm included benznidazole. Data were added from a prospective cohort of patients with Chagas disease at our centre (January 2007-June 2017). Weighted rates of ARs and TDs were estimated, and potentially related factors were analysed.
Some 413 studies were found, from which we chose 42 (nine clinical trials and 33 observational studies, including ours), comprising data for 7822 patients. The weighted rate of ARs to benznidazole was 44.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37.2-51.2).

30001347,Development of Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro assays to identify compounds suitable for progression in Chagas' disease drug discovery.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas' disease is responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in Latin America. Current treatments display variable efficacy and have adverse side effects, hence more effective, better tolerated drugs are needed. However, recent efforts have proved unsuccessful with failure of the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor posaconazole in phase II clinical trials despite promising in vitro and in vivo studies. The lack of translation between laboratory experiments and clinical outcome is a major issue for further drug discovery efforts. Our goal was to identify cell-based assays that could differentiate current nitro-aromatic drugs nifurtimox and benznidazole from posaconazole. Using a panel of T. cruzi strains including the six major lineages (TcI-VI), we found that strain PAH179 (TcV) was markedly less susceptible to posaconazole in vitro. Determination of parasite doubling and cycling times as well as EdU labelling experiments all indicate that this lack of sensitivity is due to the slow doubling and cycling time of strain PAH179. This is in accordance with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition by posaconazole leading to critically low ergosterol levels only after multiple rounds of division, and is further supported by the lack of effect of posaconazole on the non-replicative trypomastigote form. A washout experiment with prolonged posaconazole treatment showed that, even for more rapidly replicating strains, this compound cannot clear all parasites, indicative of a heterogeneous parasite population in vitro and potentially the presence of quiescent parasites. Benznidazole in contrast was able to kill all parasites. The work presented here shows clear differentiation between the nitro-aromatic drugs and posaconazole in several assays, and suggests that in vitro there may be clinically relevant heterogeneity in the parasite population that can be revealed in long-term washout experiments. Based on these findings we have adjusted our in vitro screening cascade so that only the most promising compounds are progressed to in vivo experiments.",,,,2018-07-13,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
29972690,Evaluation of the immune response against Trypanosoma cruzi cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase in human natural infection.,"B-cell epitope prediction, T-cell and B-cell response, chronic Chagas disease, peroxiredoxin",Immunology,"Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, has a highly efficient detoxification system to deal with the oxidative burst imposed by its host. One of the antioxidant enzymes involved is the cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase (c-TXNPx), which catalyses the reduction to hydrogen peroxide, small-chain organic hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite. This enzyme is present in all parasite stages, and its overexpression renders parasites more resistant to the oxidative defences of macrophages, favouring parasite survival. This work addressed the study of the specific humoral and cellular immune response triggered by c-TXNPx in human natural infection. Thus, sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from chronically infected asymptomatic and cardiac patients, and non-infected individuals. Results showed that levels of IgG antibodies against c-TXNPx were low in sera from individuals across all groups. B-cell epitope prediction limited immunogenicity to a few, small regions on the c-TXNPx sequence. At a cellular level, PBMC from asymptomatic and cardiac patients proliferated and secreted interferon-γ after c-TXNPx stimulation, compared with mock control. However, only proliferation was higher in asymptomatic patients compared with cardiac and non-infected individuals.

Despite the encouraging results in preclinical studies, cell therapy-based clinical trials for ALS have achieved only modest results so far, probably due to the genotypic variations seen among ALS patients, which is difficult to reproduce in animal models. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has enabled the development of patient-specific cell lines, a valuable tool to investigate in vitro molecular mechanisms of the disease and therapies in different genetic backgrounds.

The activation of type I interferon in differentiating myoblasts abolished myotube formation with reduced myogenin expression while in differentiated myotubes, we observed a reduction in surface area and an upregulation of atrophy-associated genes. In vitro endothelial cells exposure to type I interferon disrupted vascular network organization. All the pathogenic effects observed in vitro were abolished by ruxolitinib. Finally, four refractory dermatomyositis patients were treated with ruxolitinib and improvement ensued in skin lesions, muscle weakness and a reduced serum type I interferon levels and interferon-inducbile genes scores. We propose JAK inhibition as a mechanism-based treatment for dermatomyositis, a finding that is relevant for the design of future clinical trials targeting dermatomyositis.",,,,2018-05-10,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
29685164,Chemoprophylaxis of leprosy with rifampicin in contacts of multibacillary patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Chemoprophylaxis, Clinical trial, Contacts, Leprosy, Rifampicin",Trials,"The annual new-case detection rate for leprosy, while generally stable over the last decade, shows that transmission rates have remained stagnant despite the successful worldwide administration of multidrug therapy since the 1980s. As such, novel control strategies are urgently needed. Focusing on managing leprosy patient contacts, the most susceptible to contracting the disease, has been seen as a potential strategy in limiting the spread of leprosy as shown by a number of recent epidemiological studies. Immunoprophylaxis with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been seen as an effective preventive measure due to its ability to stimulate the development of cellular immunity which is essential in controlling the disease, especially in its multibacillary (MB) forms. The association of immunoprophylaxis with chemoprophylaxis in a single dose of rifampicin has been shown to be a promising preventive strategy, although a variety of studies have found instances of early case detection just a few months after BCG vaccination.
The present study is a phase IV chemoprophylactic clinical trial consisting of administration of a single dose of rifampicin in MB leprosy patient contacts under care at the Souza Araújo Outpatient Clinic/FIOCRUZ as part of a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study. It is comprised of two groups: 1) rifampicin + BCG; and 2) placebo + BCG.
The aim is to evaluate whether the use of chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of rifampicin in MB leprosy patient contacts prior to the BCG vaccine would be able to prevent the onset of leprosy in those cases that may occur just a few months after vaccination. Contact subclinical infections (polymerase chain reaction) and the immunological parameters (anti-PGL-1, anti-LID-1, and IFN-γ) will be evaluated and the results will be compared after 12 months of follow-up.

Even after decades of AD research, there are still limited options for treating dementia. Mounting evidence has indicated that AD patients develop central and peripheral metabolic dysfunction, and the underpinnings of such events have recently begun to emerge. Basic and preclinical studies have unveiled key pathophysiological mechanisms that include aberrant brain stress signaling, inflammation, and impaired insulin sensitivity. These findings are in accordance with clinical and neuropathological data suggesting that AD patients undergo central and peripheral metabolic deregulation. Here, we review recent basic and clinical findings indicating that metabolic defects are central to AD pathophysiology. We further propose a view for future therapeutics that incorporates metabolic defects as a core feature of AD pathogenesis. This approach could improve disease understanding and therapy development through drug repurposing and/or identification of novel metabolic targets.",,,,2018-03-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
29543803,Development and evaluation of a novel high-throughput image-based fluorescent neutralization test for detection of Zika virus infection.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus belonging to the genus flavivirus that comprises other important public health viruses, such as dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV). In general, ZIKV infection is a self-limiting disease, however cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital brain abnormalities in newborn infants have been reported. Diagnosing ZIKV infection remains a challenge, as viral RNA detection is only applicable until a few days after the onset of symptoms. After that, serological tests must be applied, and, as expected, high cross-reactivity between ZIKV and other flavivirus serology is observed. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is indicated to confirm positive samples for being more specific, however it is laborious intensive and time consuming, representing a major bottleneck for patient diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we developed a high-throughput image-based fluorescent neutralization test for ZIKV infection by serological detection. Using 226 human specimens, we showed that the new test presented higher throughput than traditional PRNT, maintaining the correlation between results. Furthermore, when tested with dengue virus samples, it showed 50.53% less cross reactivity than MAC-ELISA. This fluorescent neutralization test could be used for clinical diagnosis confirmation of ZIKV infection, as well as for vaccine clinical trials and seroprevalence studies.",,,,2018-03-16,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Despite human infection by this virus being first described in the 1950s, there is a lack of adequate therapeutic evaluations to guide evidence-based recommendations. The current guidelines rely heavily in specialists' opinion and experience instead of using higher rated evidence. Areas covered: A systematic review of the literature was performed- not restricted to clinical trials - reporting the therapeutic response against this infection with the intent to gather the best evidence of the treatment options against musculoskeletal disorders following chikungunya fever. The 15 studies included in the analysis were categorized considering the initiation of treatment during the acute, subacute and chronic phase. Expert commentary: This review demonstrates the complexity of chikungunya fever and difficulty of therapeutic management. This review found no current evidence-based treatment recommendations for the musculoskeletal disorders following chikungunya fever. To provide an optimal treatment that prevents perpetuation or progression of chikungunya infection to a potentially destructive and permanent condition without causing more harm is an aim that must be pursued by researchers and health professionals working with this disease.",,,,2018-03-14,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Compensatory mechanisms through a decrease in energy expenditure and/or an increase in caloric consumption is a possible explanation. Several physiological mechanisms involved in the energy balance could explain compensatory mechanisms, but the influences of physical exercise on these adjustments are still unclear. Therefore, the present trial aims to evaluate the effects of exercise on non-exercise physical activity energy expenditure, energy intake and appetite sensations among active overweight/obese adults, as well as, to investigate hormonal changes associated with physical exercise.
This study is a randomized controlled trial with parallel, three-group experimental arms. Eighty-one overweight/obese adults will be randomly allocated (1:1:1 ratio) to a vigorous exercise group, moderate exercise group or control group. The trial will be conducted at a military institution and the intervention groups will be submitted to exercise sessions in the evening, three times a week for 65 min, during a 2-week period. The primary outcome will be total spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure during a 2-week period. Secondary outcomes will be caloric intake, appetite sensations and laboratorial biomarkers. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed using linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the effect of treatment-by-time interaction on primary and secondary outcomes. Data analysis will be performed using SAS 9.3 and statistical significance will be set at p < 0.05.
The results of the present study will help to understand the effect of physical exercise training on subsequent non-exercise physical activity, appetite and energy intake as well as understand the physiological mechanisms underlying a possible compensatory phenomenon, supporting the development of more effective interventions for prevention and treatment of obesity.

Nevertheless, even though MSC administration has been demonstrated to be safe in clinical trials, to date, few studies have shown evidence of MSC efficacy in respiratory diseases. The present review describes strategies to enhance the beneficial effects of MSCs, including preconditioning (under hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, serum deprivation, and exposure to inflammatory biological samples) and genetic manipulation. These strategies can variably promote increases in MSC survival rates, by inducing expression of cytoprotective genes, as well as increase MSC potency by improving secretion of reparative factors. Furthermore, these strategies have been demonstrated to enhance the beneficial effects of MSCs in preclinical lung disease models. However, there is still a long way to go before such strategies can be translated from bench to bedside.",,,,2018-02-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

New effective molecules, without collateral effects, has promoted the investigation to develop new lead compounds with to advance for clinical trials. Previously, 3-nitro-1H-1,2,4-triazole-based amines and 1,2,3-triazoles demonstrated significant trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi. In this paper, we synthesized a new series of 92 examples of 1,2,3-triazoles. Six compounds exhibited antiparasitic activity, 14, 25, 27, 31 and 40, 43 and were effective against epimastigotes of two strains of T. cruzi (Y and Dm28-C) and 25, 27 and 31 exhibited trypanocidal activity similar to benzonidazole. Notably, the compound 25 compared to benzonidazole increase the toxicity against T. cruzi, with no apparent toxicity to the cell line of mice macrophages or primary mice peritoneal macrophages. As results, we calculated selectivity indexes up to 2000 to 25 and 31 in both T. cruzi strains. Derivative 14 caused a trypanostatic effect because it did not damage external epimastigote membrane.

In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of three oral E1224 (a water-soluble ravuconazole prodrug) regimens and benznidazole versus placebo in adult chronic indeterminate Chagas disease.
In this proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomised phase 2 clinical trial, we recruited adults (18-50 years) with confirmed diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection from two outpatient units in Bolivia. Patients were randomised with a computer-generated randomisation list, which was stratified by centre and used a block size of ten. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to five oral treatment groups: high-dose E1224 (duration 8 weeks, total dose 4000 mg), low-dose E1224 (8 weeks, 2000 mg), short-dose E1224 (4 weeks + 4 weeks placebo, 2400 mg), benznidazole (60 days, 5 mg/kg per day), or placebo (8 weeks, E1224-matched tablets). Double-blinding was limited to the E1224 and placebo arms, and assessors were masked to all treatment allocations. The primary efficacy endpoint was parasitological response to E1224 at the end of treatment, assessed by PCR. The secondary efficacy endpoints were parasitological response to benznidazole at end of treatment, assessed by PCR; sustainability of parasitological response until 12 months; parasite clearance and changes in parasite load; incidence of conversion to negative response in conventional and non-conventional (antigen trypomastigote chemiluminescent ELISA [AT CL-ELISA]) serological response; changes in levels of biomarkers; and complete response. The primary analysis population consisted of all randomised patients by their assigned treatment arms. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01489228.
Between July 19, 2011, and July 26, 2012, we screened 560 participants with confirmed Chagas disease, of whom 231 were enrolled and assigned to high-dose E1224 (n=45), low-dose E1224 (n=48), short-dose E1224 (n=46), benznidazole (n=45), or placebo (n=47). Parasite clearance was observed with E1224 during the treatment phase, but no sustained response was seen with low-dose and short-dose regimens, whereas 13 patients (29%, 95% CI 16·4-44·3) had sustained response with the high-dose regimen compared with four (9%, 2·4-20·4) in the placebo group (p<0·0001). Benznidazole had a rapid and sustained effect on parasite clearance, with 37 patients (82%, 67·9-92·0) with sustained response at 12-month follow-up. After 1 week of treatment, mean quantitative PCR repeated measurements showed a significant reduction in parasite load in all treatment arms versus placebo. Parasite levels in the low-dose and short-dose E1224 groups gradually returned to placebo levels. Both treatments were well tolerated. Reversible, dose-dependent liver enzyme increases were seen with E1224 and benznidazole. 187 (81%) participants developed treatment-emergent adverse events and six (3%) developed treatment-emergent serious adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events were headaches, nausea, pruritus, peripheral neuropathy, and hypersensitivity.
E1224 is the first new chemical entity developed for Chagas disease in decades. E1224 displayed a transient, suppressive effect on parasite clearance, whereas benznidazole showed early and sustained efficacy until 12 months of follow-up. Despite PCR limitations, our results support increased diagnosis and access to benznidazole standard regimen, and provide a development roadmap for novel benznidazole regimens in monotherapy and in combinations with E1224.

In May 2011, interim study results showed benefit of early ART, and all participants were offered ART regardless of CD4 cell count; the study ended in 2015.
Virologic failure was defined as 2 consecutive viral loads >1000 copies/mL >24 weeks after ART initiation. Drug resistance testing was performed for pretreatment (baseline) and failure samples from participants with virologic failure.
HIV genotyping results were obtained for 211/249 participants (128 early ART arm and 83 delayed ART arm) with virologic failure. Drug resistance was detected in 4.7% of participants at baseline; 35.5% had new resistance at failure.

Concerns remain over the efficacy and safety of ivabradine on heart failure (HF) due to Chagas disease (ChD). We therefore conducted a post hoc analysis of the SHIFT trial to investigate the effect of ivabradine in these patients.
SHIFT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic systolic stable HF, HR ≥ 70 b.p.m., and in sinus rhythm. The ChD HF subgroup included 38 patients, 20 on ivabradine, and 18 on placebo. The ChD HF subgroup showed high prevalence of bundle branch right block and, compared with the overall SHIFT population, lower systolic blood pressure; higher use of diuretics, cardiac glycosides, and antialdosterone agents; and lower use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker or target daily dose of beta-blocker. ChD HF presented a poor prognosis (all-cause mortality at 2 years was ~60%). The mean twice-daily dose of ivabradine was 6.26 ± 1.15 mg and placebo 6.43 ± 1.55 mg. Ivabradine reduced HR from 77.9 ± 3.8 to 62.3 ± 10.1 b.p.m. (P = 0.005) and improved functional class (P = 0.02). A trend towards reduction in all-cause death was observed in ivabradine arm vs. placebo (P = 0.07). Ivabradine was not associated with serious bradycardia, atrioventricular block, hypotension, or syncope.
ChD HF is an advanced form of HF with poor prognosis. Ivabradine was effective in reducing HR in these patients and improving functional class. Although our results are based on a very limited sample and should be interpreted with caution, they suggest that ivabradine may have a favourable benefit-risk profile in ChD HF patients.",,,,2017-12-22,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Current treatments targeting the parasite are limited to two old nitroheterocyclic drugs with serious side effects. The need for new and safer drugs has prompted numerous drug discovery efforts to identify compounds suitable for parasitological cure in the last decade. Areas covered: Target-based drug discovery has been limited by the small number of well-validated targets - the latest example being the failure of azoles, T. cruzi CYP51 inhibitors, in proof-of-concept clinical trials; instead phenotypic-based drug discovery has become the main pillar of Chagas R&D. Rather than focusing on the technical features of these screening assays, the authors describe the different assays developed and available in the field, and provide a critical view on their values and limitations in the screening cascade for Chagas drug development. Expert opinion: The application of technological advances to the field of Chagas disease has led to a variety of phenotypic assays that have not only changed the disease discovery landscape but have also helped us to gain a better understanding of parasite/host interactions.

An EQA program was devised for three clinical trials of CD: the E1224 (NCT01489228), a pro-drug of ravuconazole; the Sampling Study (NCT01678599), that used benznidazole, both conducted in Bolivia; and the CHAGASAZOL (NCT01162967), that tested posaconazole, conducted in Spain. Four proficiency testing panels containing negative controls and seronegative blood samples spiked with 1, 10 and 100 parasite equivalents (par. eq.)/mL of four Trypanosoma cruzi stocks, were sent from the Core Lab in Argentina to the participating laboratories located in Bolivia and Spain. Panels were analyzed simultaneously, blinded to sample allocation, at 4-month intervals. In addition, 302 random blood samples from both trials carried out in Bolivia were sent to Core Lab for retesting analysis.

This zoonotic cat-man alternative transmission route elicited changes in strategies to control the epidemic. There was a progressive increase in the number of cases involving especially children and the elderly. In addition to becoming hyperendemic, uncommon clinical pictures like immunoreactive clinical presentations or severe systemic cases have emerged. New species were identified and classified through molecular tools using more virulent clinical isolates, like S. brasiliensis, compared to the environmental isolates. Likewise, different species of Sporothrix have been associated with different geographic regions. The serological and molecular techniques are used as an auxiliary tool for the diagnosis and/or for species identification, although the isolation and the identification of Sporothrix spp. in clinical specimen is still the gold standard. Currently sporotrichosis epidemics requires the knowledge of the epidemiological-molecular profile to control the disease and the specific treatment. Itraconazole, potassium iodide, terfinafine, and amphotericin B are the available drugs in Brazil to treat sporotrichosis.

We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction caused by Chagas' disease, with other etiologies, in the era of modern HF therapies.
This study included 2552 Latin American patients randomized in the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) and ATMOSPHERE (Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure) trials. The investigator-reported etiology was categorized as Chagasic, other nonischemic, or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The outcomes of interest included the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and its components and death from any cause. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare outcomes by pathogenesis. There were 195 patients with Chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction, 1300 with other nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and 1057 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Compared with other etiologies, Chagasic patients were more often female, younger, and had lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment (but had higher prevalence of stroke and pacemaker implantation) and had worse health-related quality of life. The rates of the composite outcome were 17.2, 12.5, and 11.4 per 100 person-years for Chagasic, other nonischemic, and ischemic patients, respectively-adjusted hazard ratio for Chagasic versus other nonischemic: 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.94;

Animal study and primary cell culture.
Laboratory investigation.
Seventy-five Wistar rats.
Wistar rats received saline (control) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (acute respiratory distress syndrome) intratracheally. On day 2, acute respiratory distress syndrome animals were further randomized to receive saline or bone marrow, adipose tissue, or lung tissue mesenchymal stem cells (1 × 10 cells) IV. Lung mechanics, histology, and protein levels of inflammatory mediators and growth factors were analyzed 5 days after mesenchymal stem cells administration. RAW 264.7 cells (a macrophage cell line) were incubated with lipopolysaccharide followed by coculture or not with bone marrow, adipose tissue, and lung tissue mesenchymal stem cells (10 cells/mL medium).
Regardless of mesenchymal stem cells source, cells administration improved lung function and reduced alveolar collapse, tissue cellularity, collagen, and elastic fiber content in lung tissue, as well as decreased apoptotic cell counts in liver. Bone marrow and adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells administration also reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as apoptotic cell counts in lung and kidney, while increasing expression of keratinocyte growth factor in lung tissue. Additionally, mesenchymal stem cells differently modulated the secretion of biomarkers by macrophages depending on their source.
Mesenchymal stem cells from different sources led to variable responses in lungs and distal organs. Bone marrow and adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells yielded greater beneficial effects than lung tissue mesenchymal stem cells.

A single high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HFHC) meal induces an increase in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Previous studies have shown that orange juice is able to prevent this response by inhibiting toll like receptors (TLR) expression and endotoxemia. Our goal was to study the proteome response in PBMC after the consumption of a HFHC meal consumed with water, orange juice or an isocaloric beverage (water with glucose). Twelve healthy individuals completed the protocol in a crossover design, and blood samples were obtained before and 1, 3, and 5 h after consumption. Proteomic profile, glucose, insulin, lipid and cytokines levels were investigated. The glycemic and insulinemic response was higher when the meal was consumed with glucose, while there was no difference in the response between water and orange juice. Proteome analysis in PBMC was carried out using TMT ten-plex. A total of 3813 proteins, originating from 15 662 peptides were identified. Three proteins showed significantly altered expression in the three treatments: apolipoprotein A-II, ceruloplasmin and hemopexin. When the HFHC meal was consumed with water there was an increase in some inflammatory pathways such as the Fc-gamma receptor dependent phagocytosis and the complement cascade, but the immune system as a whole was not significantly altered. However, when the meal was consumed with glucose, the immune system was up regulated. Among the pathways induced after 3 h were those of the adaptive immune system and cytokine signaling. Five hours after the meal, pathways of the complement cascade and classical antibody mediated complement activation were up regulated. When the meal was consumed with orange juice there was an up regulation of proteins involved in signal transduction, DNA replication and cell cycle. The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) showed a 28.2-fold increase. This protein was down regulated when the meal was consumed with water. Regarding the immune system, several of the pathways induced by glucose were down regulated when the meal was consumed with orange juice: proteins involved with the adaptive immune system and cytokine signaling. Therefore, we have shown that orange juice can not only suppress diet induced inflammation, but also regulate the expression of proteins such as PML, which may play a key role in the regulation of metabolism.",,,,2017-09-21,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

However, VAP prevention bundles focus mainly on late-onset VAP and may be less effective in preventing EO-VAP in comatose patients. Systemic antibiotic administration at the time of intubation may have a role in preventing EO-VAP. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of systemic antibiotic administration in VAP prevention in comatose patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
We searched for studies published through December 2015 that evaluated systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in comatose patients. Two authors independently selected and evaluated full-length reports of randomized clinical trials or prospective cohorts in patients aged >16 years that evaluated the impact of systemic antibiotics at the time of intubation on EO-VAP compared to placebo or no prophylaxis. The outcome variables were the incidence of EO-VAP, the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality.
We identified 10,988 citations, yielding 26 articles for further analysis; three studies with 267 patients were finally analyzed. Most patients (n = 135) were comatose due to head trauma. Systemic antibiotic administration was associated with decreased incidence of EO-VAP (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54) and shorter ICU LOS (standardized mean difference -0.32; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.08), but had no effect on mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.7-1.53) or duration of mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference -0.16; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.08).

Although immunoregulatory dysfunction has been associated to the chronic cardiac involvement in Chagas disease, there is no study examining the effects of omega-3 supplementation in these patients. We investigated the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on markers of inflammation and lipid profile in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy patients.
The present study was a single-center double-blind clinical trial including patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive omega-3 PUFAs capsules (1.8g EPA and 1.2g DHA) or placebo (corn oil) during an 8-week period. Cytokines, fasting glucose, lipid, and anthropometric profiles were evaluated.

Despite several antigen candidates have been evaluated, a comparison among the performance of the immunogens cannot be carried out because the available reports differ in formulations and infection model. In this work, we compared the protective capacity of seven T. cruzi antigens in the same model of five new antigens and two well-established candidates. Materials & methods: We evaluated highly immunogenic proteins that contain tandem repeats (FRA [flagelar repetitive protein], Tc3, Tc6); enzymes involved in metabolic pathways critical for parasite survival (cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase and tryparedoxin peroxidase); and enzymes involved in parasite invasion (trans-sialidase [TS] and cruzipain). All these antigens were formulated with Freund's adjuvant and protection against the parasite infection was assessed in BALB/c mice.
Tc3, cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase, cruzipain and TS showed the best outcome after infection in survival level and parasitemia. According to these data, these groups were also assessed using the ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant which is being used in clinical trials.

We examined the association of HIV diversity with virologic outcomes in adults from the HPTN 052 trial who initiated ART at CD4 cell counts of 350-550 cells/mm3. A high resolution melting (HRM) assay was used to analyze baseline (pre-treatment) HIV diversity in six regions in the HIV genome (two in gag, one in pol, and three in env) from 95 participants who failed ART. We analyzed the association of HIV diversity in each genomic region with baseline (pre-treatment) factors and three clinical outcomes: time to virologic suppression after ART initiation, time to ART failure, and emergence of HIV drug resistance at ART failure. After correcting for multiple comparisons, we did not find any association of baseline HIV diversity with demographic, laboratory, or clinical characteristics. For the 18 analyses performed for clinical outcomes evaluated, there was only one significant association: higher baseline HIV diversity in one of the three HIV env regions was associated with longer time to ART failure (p = 0.008).

Effects of combination therapy with benznidazole and posaconazole have not been tested in Trypanosoma cruzi carriers.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether posaconazole alone or combined with benznidazole were superior to benznidazole monotherapy in eliminating T. cruzi parasites measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in asymptomatic Chagas carriers.
A prospective, multicenter randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted in 120 subjects from Latin America and Spain who were randomized to 4 groups: posaconazole 400 mg twice a day (b.i.d.); benznidazole 200 mg + placebo b.i.d.; benznidazole 200 mg b.i.d. + posaconazole 400 mg b.i.d.; or placebo 10 mg b.i.d. T. cruzi deoxyribonucleic acid was detected by RT-PCR at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 360 days. The primary efficacy outcome is the proportion of subjects with persistent negative RT-PCR by day 180; the secondary outcome was negative RT-PCR at 360 days.
Only 13.3% of those receiving posaconazole and 10% receiving placebo achieved the primary outcome, compared with 80% receiving benznidazole + posaconazole and 86.7% receiving benznidazole monotherapy (p < 0.0001 vs. posaconazole/placebo). Posaconazole monotherapy or posaconazole combined with benznidazole achieved high RT-PCR conversion rates during treatment (30 days; 93.3% and 88.9% and 60 days; 90%, and 92.3%) that were similar to benznidazole (89.7% and 89.3%); all were superior to placebo or posaconazole (10% and 16.7%, p < 0.0001).

Although the pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy is incompletely understood, it may involve several mechanisms, including parasite-dependent myocardial damage, immune-mediated myocardial injury (induced by the parasite itself and by self-antigens), and microvascular and neurogenic disturbances. In the past three decades, a consensus has emerged that parasite persistence is crucial to the development and progression of Chagas cardiomyopathy. In this context, antiparasitic treatment in the chronic phase of Chagas disease could prevent complications related to the disease. However, according to the results of the BENEFIT trial, benznidazole seems to have no benefit for arresting disease progression in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.

Although BNZ has been used to treat Chagas disease since the 1970s, few studies about the biodistribution of this drug exist. In this study, BNZ tissue biodistribution in a murine model and its pharmacokinetic profile in plasma were monitored. A bioanalytical high-performance liquid chromatography method with a UV detector (HPLC-UV) was developed and validated according to the European Medicines Agency for quantification of BNZ in organs and plasma samples prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate. The developed method was linear in the BNZ concentration, which ranged from 0.1 to 100.0 μg/ml for plasma, spleen, brain, colon, heart, lung, and kidney and from 0.2 to 100.0 μg/ml for liver. Validation assays demonstrated good stability for BNZ under all conditions evaluated. Pharmacokinetic parameters confirmed rapid, but low, absorption of BNZ after oral administration. Biodistribution assays demonstrated different maximum concentrations in organs and similar times to maximum concentration and mean residence times, with means of 40 min and 2.5 h, respectively.

Swiss mice were randomized into five groups: control, uninfected; infected without treatment; and infected treated with vitamins C, E or ibuprofen. Animals were inoculated with 2000 trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. After 20 days, infected mice presented reduced vitamin C and E tissue levels, high cytokines (interferon gamma, tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin 10 and chemokine ligand 2), prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α ) and nitric oxide (NO) cardiac production, intense myocarditis and reactive tissue damage, which was directly correlated with the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate and the degree of pathological cardiac remodelling. Vitamins C and E supplementation were irrelevant to counteract reactive tissue damage and myocarditis in infected animals. Conversely, ibuprofen reduced tissue levels of cytokines, PGF2α and NO, as well as lipid and protein oxidation, antioxidant enzyme activity and the cardiac damage, without interfering with heart parasitism. Our results do not support the applicability of vitamin C and E supplementation in the management of acute Chagas cardiomyopathy.

HIV,"The effects of antiretroviral therapy on risk of severe bacterial infections in people with high CD4 cell counts have not been well described. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of immediate versus deferred ART on the risk of severe bacterial infection in people with high CD4 cell counts in a preplanned analysis of the START trial.
The START trial was a randomised controlled trial in ART-naive HIV-positive patients with CD4 cell count of more than 500 cells per μL assigned to immediate ART or deferral until their CD4 cell counts were lower than 350 cells per μL. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model time to severe bacterial infection, which was defined as a composite endpoint of bacterial pneumonia (confirmed by the endpoint review committee), pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, or any bacterial infectious disorder of grade 4 severity, that required unscheduled hospital admissions, or caused death. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00867048.
Patients were recruited from April 15, 2009, to Dec 23, 2013. The data cutoff for follow-up was May 26, 2015. Of 4685 HIV-positive people enrolled, 120 had severe bacterial infections (immediate-initiation group n=34, deferred-initiation group n=86; median 2·8 years of follow-up). Immediate ART was associated with a reduced risk of severe bacterial infection compared with deferred ART (hazard ratio [HR] 0·39, 95% CI 0·26-0·57, p<0·0001). In the immediate-initiation group, average neutrophil count over follow-up was 321 cells per μL higher, and average CD4 cell count 194 cells per μL higher than the deferred-initiation group (p<0·0001). In univariable analysis, higher time-updated CD4 cell count (0·78, 0·71-0·85, p=0·0001) was associated with reduced risk of severe bacterial infection. Time-updated neutrophil count was not associated with severe bacterial infection. After adjustment for time-updated factors in multivariable analysis, particularly the CD4 cell count, the HR for immediate-initiation group moved closer to 1 (HR 0·84, 0·50-1·41, p=0·52). These results were consistent when subgroups of the severe bacterial infection composite were analysed separately.
Immediate ART reduces the risk of several severe bacterial infections in HIV-positive people with high CD4 cell count. This is partly explained by ART-induced increases in CD4 cell count, but not by increases in neutrophil count.

Moreover, no significant differences were found between patients without LVSD and those with LVSD. Higher CCL3 and CCL4 plasma levels were found in patients with LVSD compared to those with the digestive form of the disease. The CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines might not be involved in differential susceptibility to the digestive and cardiac clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease, and it seems they do not influence the development of LVSD.",,,,2016-12-22,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
27906977,Development of a PCR Assay to Detect Low Level Trypanosoma cruzi in Blood Specimens Collected with PAXgene Blood DNA Tubes for Clinical Trials Treating Chagas Disease.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease is caused by the parasitic infection of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). The STOP CHAGAS clinical trial was initiated in 2011 to evaluate posaconazole in treating Chagas disease, with treatment success defined as negative qualitative PCR results of detecting the parasites in blood specimens collected post-treatment. PAXgene Blood DNA tubes were utilized as a simple procedure to collect and process blood specimens. However, the PAXgene blood specimens challenged published T. cruzi PCR methods, resulting in poor sensitivity and reproducibility. To accurately evaluate the treatment efficacy of the clinical study, we developed and validated a robust PCR assay for detecting low level T. cruzi in PAXgene blood specimens. The assay combines a new DNA extraction method with a custom designed qPCR assay, resulting in limit of detection of 0.005 and 0.01 fg/μl for K98 and CL Brener, two representative strains of two of T. cruzi's discrete typing units. Reliable qPCR standard curves were established for both strains to measure parasite loads, with amplification efficiency ≥ 90% and the lower limit of linearity ≥ 0.05 fg/μl. The assay successfully analyzed the samples collected from the STOP CHAGAS study and may prove useful for future global clinical trials evaluating new therapies for asymptomatic chronic Chagas disease.",,,,2016-12-03,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This disease affects millions of people worldwide. The current chemotherapy for it is based on benznidazole (Bz) and nifurtimox (Nif) and is unsatisfactory. In this review, we will focus on the search for potential target organelles and molecules for the chemotherapy of Chagas disease. We consider as potential target organelles those that are absent or significantly different in host cells and present in the clinically relevant forms of the parasite (trypomastigotes and amastigotes), which are the mitochondrion, cytoskeletal-related structures, the acidocalcisomes/ contractile vacuole complex and glycosomes. Most molecular targets are key enzymes involved in processes that are essential to parasite survival, such as sterol biosynthesis, antioxidant defences and bioenergetic pathways. Among the molecular targets, enzymes of the sterol pathway, particularly C14α-sterol demethylase, are still the most promising target, even if clinical trials with posaconazole and E1224 have failed to sustain efficacy. We believe that in the near future, the Chagas community will have a ""clear shot"" at new drug candidates for Chagas disease based on the accumulated knowledge about trypanosomatid biochemistry, preclinical studies, advances in screening technologies, the efforts of medicinal chemists in the synthesis of both azolic and non-azolic inhibitors, and the interest of pharmaceutical companies in the development of new antifungal agents, which form a critical mass of information.",,,,2016-10-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
27784230,Targets and Patented Drugs for Chemotherapy of Chagas Disease in the Last 15 Years-Period.,"Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, drug targets, patents",Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery,"The American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, is a parasitic infection typically spread by triatomine vectors affecting millions of people all over Latin America. Existing chemotherapy is centered on the nitroaromatic compounds benznidazole and nifurtimox that provide unsatisfactory results and substantial side effects. So, the finding and exploration of novel ways to challenge this neglected disease is a main priority.
The biologic and biochemical progress in the scientific knowledge of Trypanosoma cruzi in the period comprising last 15-years has increased the identification of multiple targets for Chagas´ disease chemotherapy. In the middle of the best encouraging targets for trypanocidal drugs, ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and cruzipain, a key cysteine protease (CP) of T. cruzi, have been pointed out. Unfortunately, recent clinical trials investigating the administration of pozoconazole and ravuconazole to chronic indeterminate Chagas disease patients revealed their inferiority compared to the standard drug Benznidazole.
In view of the information gained in the preceding years, a reasonable approach for the fast development of novel anti-T. cruzi chemotherapy would be focused on K777, the cysteine proteinase inhibitor (CPI) near to enter to clinical trials, and founded on the clinical evaluation of combination of known drugs with existing trypanocidal agents to obtain more efficiency and less secondary effects. Top series of xanthine have been recently identified as clinical candidate for Chagas disease. In addition, trypanothione biosynthesis, thiol-dependant redox and polyamine metabolism, the glycolytic, glyconeogenic, pentose phosphate, lipidic and polyisoprenoid biosynthetic pathways, and the enzymes from biosynthetic glycoconjugates pathways have been studied. Several specific enzymes from these particular biosynthetic pathways such as hypoxanthine-guaninephosphoribosyl- transferase and farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase, among others, have also been broadly studied in T. cruzi. Novel synthesized anti-T. cruzi compounds with or without specific single or multi-target assigned are also described in detail.
In summary, loans on anti-Chagas disease agents focused to specific parasite targets as their metabolic pathways or specific enzymes will be summarized. Targets will also be specifically discussed.

Trypanothione reductase (TryR) is the key enzyme to develop this disease. Though this enzyme is well thought-out as potential drug target, the accurate structure of enzyme-inhibitor complex is required to design a potential inhibitor which is less available for TryR. In this research, we aimed to investigate the advanced drug over the available existing drugs by designing inhibitors as well as to identify a new enzyme-inhibitor complex that may act as a template for drug design. A set of analogues were designed from a known inhibitor Quinacrine Mustard (QUM) to identify the effective inhibitor against this enzyme. Further, the pharmacoinformatics elucidation and structural properties of designed inhibitor proposed effective drug candidates against Chagas disease. Molecular docking study suggests that a designed inhibitor has higher binding affinity in both crystal and modeled TryR and also poses similar interacting residues as of crystal TryR-QUM complex structure. The comparative studies based on in silico prediction proposed an enzyme-inhibitor complex which could be effective to control the disease activity. So our in silico analysis based on TryR built model, Pharmacophore and docking analysis might play an important role for the development of novel therapy for Chagas disease.

A pharmacological approach is necessary to treat NASH because of failure to change dietary habits and lifestyle in most patients. Insulin resistance with an increased release of free fatty acids, oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory cytokines seem to be key features for disease progression. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and antioxidant agents, such as vitamin E, were the first pharmacological options to be evaluated for NASH. In recent years, several new molecules that target different pathways related to NASH pathogenesis, such as liver metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, have been developed. Obeticholic acid (INT-747) and elafibranor (GFT-505) have provided promising results in phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and they are being evaluated in ongoing phase III studies. Most of the potential treatments for NASH are under investigation in phase II studies, with some at phase I. This diversity in possible treatments calls for a better understanding of NASH in order to enrich trial populations with patients more susceptible to progress and to respond.

It affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, glandular and reproductive systems. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF is the respiratory disorder caused by a vicious cycle of obstruction of the airways, inflammation and infection that leads to epithelial damage, tissue remodeling and end-stage lung disease. Over the past decades, life expectancy of CF patients has increased due to early diagnosis and improved treatments; however, these patients still present limited quality of life. Many attempts have been made to rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression, function and stability, thereby overcoming the molecular basis of CF. Gene and protein variances caused by CFTR mutants lead to different CF phenotypes, which then require different treatments to quell the patients' debilitating symptoms. In order to seek better approaches to treat CF patients and maximize therapeutic effects, CFTR mutants have been stratified into six groups (although several of these mutations present pleiotropic defects). The research with CFTR modulators (read-through agents, correctors, potentiators, stabilizers and amplifiers) has achieved remarkable progress, and these drugs are translating into pharmaceuticals and personalized treatments for CF patients. This review summarizes the main molecular and clinical features of CF, emphasizes the latest clinical trials using CFTR modulators, sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying these new and emerging treatments, and discusses the major breakthroughs and challenges to treating all CF patients.",,,,2016-09-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of exercise training over functional capacity, cardiac function, quality of life, and biomarkers in Chagas heart disease.
The PEACH study is a superiority randomized clinical trial which will include subjects who meet the following criteria: Chagas heart disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction below 45 % with or without heart failure symptoms; clinical stability in the last 3 months; adherence to clinical treatment; and age above 18 years. The exclusion criteria are: pregnancy; neuromuscular limitations; smoking; evidence of non-chagasic heart disease; systemic conditions that limit exercise practice or cardiopulmonary exercise test; unavailability to attend the center three times a week during the intervention period; and practitioners of regular exercise. The intervention group will perform an exercise training intervention three times per week during 6 months and will be compared to the control group without exercise. Both groups will undergo the same monthly pharmaceutical and nutritional counseling as well as standard medical treatment according to the Brazilian consensus on Chagas disease. The primary outcome is functional capacity based on peak exercise oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Secondary outcomes are: cardiac function; body composition; muscle respiratory strength; microvascular reactivity; cardiac rhythm abnormalities; autonomic function; biochemical; oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers; and quality of life. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Thirty patients will be randomly assigned into exercise or control groups at a ratio of 1:1.
Findings of the present study will be useful to determine if physical exercise programs should be included as an important additional therapy in the treatment of patients with Chagas heart disease.

The term ""NTD"" emerged at the beginning of the new millennium to describe a set of diseases that are characterized as (1) poverty related, (2) endemic to the tropics and subtropics, (3) lacking public health attention and inadequate industrial investment, (4) having poor research funding and a weak research and development (R&D) pipeline, (5) usually associated with high morbidity but low mortality, and (6) often having no safe and long-lasting treatment available. Many additional challenges to the current control and elimination programs for NTDs exist. These include inconsistent performance of diagnostic tests, regional differences in access to treatment and in treatment outcome, lack of integrated surveillance and vector/intermediate host control, and impact of ecological climatic changes particularly in regions where new cases are increasing in previously nonendemic areas. Moreover, the development of NTD vaccines, including those for schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, hookworm, and Chagas disease are being led by nonprofit product development partnerships (PDPs) working in partnership with academic and industrial partners, contract research organizations, and in some instances vaccine manufacturers in developing countries. In this review, we emphasize global efforts to fuel the development of NTD vaccines, the translational activities needed to effectively move promising vaccine candidates to Phase-I clinical trials and some of the hurdles to ensuring their availability to people in the poorest countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.",,,,2016-08-31,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

As an emerging concept, we propose a classification of biomarkers based on plasmatic-, phenotype-, antigenic-, genetic-, and management-related candidates. The available data revisited here reveal the lessons learned thus far and the existing challenges that still lie ahead to enable biomarkers to be employed consistently in risk evaluation for this disease. There is a strong need for biomarker validation, particularly for biomarkers that are specific to the clinical forms of Chagas disease. The current failure to achieve the eradication of the transmission of this disease has produced determination to solve this validation issue.

Recent advances in the management of ARDS have mostly been achieved in supportive care, including the use of protective mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agents, prone positioning, and conservative fluid strategies. However, to date, no pharmacologic therapy has been able to act effectively on disease-specific pathways or to reduce mortality. In this context, current advances in understanding the potential roles of alternative approaches, such as cell therapy, offer new hope for ARDS.
This review discusses the use of mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) in pre-clinical experimental models of ARDS and in ongoing clinical trials.
Through the secretion of soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles, MSCs have been shown to modulate inflammation, enhance bacterial clearance, and reduce organ injury and death, making them a potential novel treatment for ARDS.

ART was then offered to all patients with HIV-1 infection (index participants). The study included more than 5 years of follow-up to assess the durability of such therapy for the prevention of HIV-1 transmission.
We randomly assigned 1763 index participants to receive either early or delayed ART. In the early-ART group, 886 participants started therapy at enrollment (CD4+ count, 350 to 550 cells per cubic millimeter). In the delayed-ART group, 877 participants started therapy after two consecutive CD4+ counts fell below 250 cells per cubic millimeter or if an illness indicative of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (i.e., an AIDS-defining illness) developed.

27388039,Pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Chagas disease-related cardiomyopathy is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Latin America. Despite the substantial burden to the healthcare system, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in people with Chagas disease. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2012.
To assess the clinical benefits and harms of current pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in people with Chagas cardiomyopathy.
We updated the searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid; 1946 to to February Week 1 2016), EMBASE (Ovid; 1947 to 2016 Week 07), LILACS (1982 to 15 February 2016), and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters; 1970 to 15 February 2016). We checked the reference lists of included papers. We applied no language restrictions.
We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that assessed the effects of pharmacological interventions to treat heart failure in adult patients (18 years or older) with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association classes II to IV), regardless of the left ventricular ejection fraction stage (reduced or preserved), with Chagas cardiomyopathy. We did not apply limits to the length of follow-up. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality at 30 days, time-to-heart decompensation, disease-free period (at 30, 60, and 90 days), and adverse events.
Two authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We estimated relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We used a fixed-effect model to synthesize the findings. We contacted authors for additional data. We developed 'Summary of findings' (SoF) tables and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence.
In this update, we identified one new trial. Therefore, this version includes three trials (108 participants). Two trials compared carvedilol against placebo and another assessed rosuvastatin versus placebo. All trials had a high risk of bias.Meta-analysis of two trials showed a lower proportion of all-cause mortality in the carvedilol groups compared with the placebo groups (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.12 to 3.88, I² = 0%; 69 participants; very low-quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on cardiovascular mortality, time-to-heart decompensation, or disease-free periods.One trial (30 participants) found no difference in hospital readmissions (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.31 to 3.28; very low-quality of evidence) or reported adverse events (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.67 to 1.27; very low-quality of evidence) between the carvedilol and placebo groups.There was very low-quality evidence from two trials of inconclusive effects on quality of life (QoL) between the carvedilol and placebo groups. One trial (30 participants) assessed QoL with the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (21 items; item scores range from 0 to 5; a lower MLHFQ score is better). The MD was -14.74; 95% CI -24.75 to -4.73. The other trial (39 participants) measured QoL with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36; item scores range from 0 to 100; higher SF-36 score is better). Data were not provided.One trial (39 participants) assessed the effect of rosuvastatin versus placebo. The trial did not report on any primary outcomes or adverse events. There was very low-quality evidence of uncertain effects on QoL (no data were provided).
This first update of our review found very low-quality evidence for the effects of either carvedilol or rosuvastatin, compared with placebo, for treating heart failure in people with Chagas disease. The three included trials were underpowered and had a high risk of bias. There were no conclusive data to support or reject the use of either carvedilol or rosuvastatin for treating Chagas cardiomyopathy. Unless randomised clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect, and the trade-off between potential benefits and harms is established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should be cautious when recommending or administering either carvedilol or rosuvastatin to treat heart failure in people with Chagas disease. The efficacy and safety of other pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in people with Chagas disease remains unknown.",,,,2016-07-09,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
27356544,Challenges in Chagas Disease Drug Discovery: A Review.,,Current medicinal chemistry,"Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Although the number of infected individuals has decreased, about 6-7 million people are infected worldwide. The chemotherapy drugs currently used are limited to benznidazole and nifurtimox. They are effective in acute phase, congenital transmission and children with chronic infection; however, recent clinical trials have shown limitations in adults with chronic infection, presenting drawbacks during the treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need for new effective, safe and affordable drugs to fight against this complex disease. There were high expectations for azole derivatives as they appeared to be the most promising drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease during the last decade; however, the disappointing results obtained so far in clinical trials evidenced the lack of correlation between preclinical and clinical development. Therefore, the feedback obtained from these studies should define the starting point for addressing a roadmap for the drug discovery process in the fight against this disease. To tackle this challenge, it is important to keep in mind the drug target profile, already defined by panels of experts, and the coordinated work involving multi-disciplinary networks focusing not only on the discovery of new drugs but also on the standardization of the protocols that would allow acceleration in the Chagas disease drug discovery process.",,,,2016-07-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
27271083,Time to HAART Initiation after Diagnosis and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Patients with AIDS in Latin America.,,PloS one,"Since 2009, earlier initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after an opportunistic infection (OI) has been recommended based on lower risks of death and AIDS-related progression found in clinical trials. Delay in HAART initiation after OIs may be an important barrier for successful outcomes in patients with advanced disease. Timing of HAART initiation after an OI in ""real life"" settings in Latin America has not been evaluated.
Patients in the Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV Epidemiology (CCASAnet) ≥18 years of age at enrolment, from 2001-2012 who had an OI before HAART initiation were included. Patients were divided in an early HAART (EH) group (those initiating within 4 weeks of an OI) and a delayed HAART (DH) group (those initiating more than 4 weeks after an OI). All patients with an AIDS-defining OI were included. In patients with more than one OI the first event reported was considered. Calendar trends in the proportion of patients in the EH group (before and after 2009) were estimated by site and for the whole cohort. Factors associated with EH were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models.
A total of 1457 patients had an OI before HAART initiation and were included in the analysis: 213 from Argentina, 686 from Brazil, 283 from Chile, 119 from Honduras and 156 from Mexico. Most prevalent OI were Tuberculosis (31%), followed by Pneumocystis pneumonia (24%), Invasive Candidiasis (16%) and Toxoplasmosis (9%). Median time from OI to HAART initiation decreased significantly from 5.7 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.8-12.1) weeks before 2009 to 4.3 (IQR 2.0-7.1) after 2009 (p<0.01). Factors associated with starting HAART within 4 weeks of OI diagnosis were lower CD4 count at enrolment (p-<0.001), having a non-tuberculosis OI (p<0.001), study site (p<0.001), and more recent years of OI diagnosis (p<0.001).
The time from diagnosis of an OI to HAART initiation has decreased in Latin America coinciding with the publication of evidence of its benefit.

Therefore, the development and evolution of this CMP has always been a major topic in numbers of previous studies. A comprehensive echocardiographic study of left ventricular (LV) mechanics, fully assessing myocardial contraction, has never been done before. This could help characterize and improve the understanding of the evolution of this prevalent CMP.
A total of 47 chagasic and 84 control patients were included in this study and allocated in groups according to LV ejection fraction. 2D-Echocardiogram was acquired for LV mechanics analysis by speckle tracking echocardiography.
Mean age of chagasic individuals was 55y and 16 (34 %) were men. Significant difference was found in global longitudinal velocity analysis, with lower values in indeterminate form. In the group with severe systolic dysfunction, a paradoxical increase in longitudinal and apical radial displacements were demonstrated. In parallel, segmental analyzes highlighted lower values of radial displacement, strain and strain rate into inferior and inferolateral walls, with increase of these values in septal and anterior walls.

We sought to analyze electrocardiographic abnormalities among children with chronic T. cruzi infection with and without trypanocidal treatment with benznidazole.
We studied 111 children 6-16 years of age with asymptomatic chronic T. cruzi infection who were recruited in 1991-1992 in Salta, Argentina. Most children were randomly assigned to benznidazole 5 mg/Kg/day (n = 47) or matching placebo (n = 48) for 60 days. Remaining children (n = 16) received treatment with benznidazole 5 mg/Kg/day open-label. Electrocardiograms were obtained at baseline and in 1995-1996, 1998, 2000 and 2005, and were analyzed using the Buenos Aires method. Among the 94 children with an electrocardiogram at baseline, 8 (8.5%) had electrocardiographic abnormalities, including 4 (4.7%) children with right bundle branch block. Proportion of abnormal electrocardiograms in the full population (n = 111) remained constant over time (media follow-up 8.6 years). Multivariable adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval [95%CI]) for electrocardiographic abnormalities in 1995-1996, 1998, 2000 and 2005 comparing children treated with benznidazole versus those not treated were 2.76 (0.66, 11.60), 2.33 (0.44, 12.31), 3.06 (0.48, 19.56), and 1.94 (0.33, 11.25), respectively. Among the 86 children with a normal electrocardiogram at baseline, 16 (18.6%) developed electrocardiographic abnormalities during follow-up. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for incident electrocardiographic abnormalities comparing children treated with benznidazole versus those not treated was 0.68 (95%CI: 0.25, 1.88).

27072716,Stairway to Heaven or Hell? Perspectives and Limitations of Chagas Disease Chemotherapy.,,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,"In this review, we intend to provide a general view of the evolution of experimental studies in the area of chemotherapy for Chagas disease. We can follow the process of drug development through three phases. The first phase began almost at the same time as the discovery made by Carlos Chagas and proceeds to 1970, during which time an extensive list of compounds was subjected to preclinical and clinical trials. The second phase began with the introduction of nifurtimox and benznidazole into the clinical setting, followed with the search for alternative drugs. In this phase, a dichotomy existed between rational and empirical approaches in preclinical studies. The third phase began with the unravelling of the T. cruzi genome. The development of transgenic parasites has allowed the development of solid HTS protocols, and the establishment of bioluminescent T. cruzi has allowed in vivo drug evaluations using a reduced number of animals. Among the wide variety of compounds subjected to preclinical studies, we have discovered azolic and non-azolic inhibitors of sterol C14α-demethylase (CYP51) and nitro compounds. Two compounds evaluated during the second phase, namely, MK-436 and allopurinol, could be revisited. Clinical studies of posaconazole and E1224 yielded disappointing results, and it is critical to understand the reason for their failure as a monotherapy. Currently, the combination and repositioning of drugs with different mechanisms of action are complementary approaches. The use of drug combinations, particularly those of nitro compounds with CYP51 inhibitors, is considered a real alternative for the treatment of Chagas disease.",,,,2016-04-14,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Lack of adherence can lead to treatment failure and death. Although studies have shown that pharmaceutical intervention can improve drug treatment for patients with chronic diseases, studies on pharmaceutical care are not only inconsistent, they are scarce and limited to developed countries, include few patients, and are not studied in randomized clinical trials. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with high hospitalization and case-fatality rates. The adherence rate is low (31.7 %) in this group of patients in Brazil, and drug treatment for the disease is complex. Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care in drug treatment adherence in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus treated at a rheumatology outpatient clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
A randomized clinical trial (pragmatic trial) will be conducted. Adult participants (women) from a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus will be followed for 12 months. A total of 120 patients will be randomized to two groups: intervention (Dader method for pharmaceutical care) and control (health/dietary counseling and risk reduction). The primary outcome will be drug treatment adherence evaluated by the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Secondary outcomes will be clinical improvement and quality of life.
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus present with low treatment adherence, thus justifying the mobilization of human resources to optimize their clinical management. Despite the proven effectiveness of pharmaceutical care for various diseases, there are still no studies evaluating its effectiveness in systemic lupus erythematosus. Our hypothesis is that the intervention will also be effective in this patient group.

27025337,Empirical tuberculosis therapy versus isoniazid in adult outpatients with advanced HIV initiating antiretroviral therapy (REMEMBER): a multicountry open-label randomised controlled trial.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Mortality within the first 6 months after initiating antiretroviral therapy is common in resource-limited settings and is often due to tuberculosis in patients with advanced HIV disease. Isoniazid preventive therapy is recommended in HIV-positive adults, but subclinical tuberculosis can be difficult to diagnose. We aimed to assess whether empirical tuberculosis treatment would reduce early mortality compared with isoniazid preventive therapy in high-burden settings.
We did a multicountry open-label randomised clinical trial comparing empirical tuberculosis therapy with isoniazid preventive therapy in HIV-positive outpatients initiating antiretroviral therapy with CD4 cell counts of less than 50 cells per μL. Participants were recruited from 18 outpatient research clinics in ten countries (Malawi, South Africa, Haiti, Kenya, Zambia, India, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Peru, and Uganda). Individuals were screened for tuberculosis using a symptom screen, locally available diagnostics, and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay when available before inclusion. Study candidates with confirmed or suspected tuberculosis were excluded. Inclusion criteria were liver function tests 2·5 times the upper limit of normal or less, a creatinine clearance of at least 30 mL/min, and a Karnofsky score of at least 30. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the empirical group (antiretroviral therapy and empirical tuberculosis therapy) or the isoniazid preventive therapy group (antiretroviral therapy and isoniazid preventive therapy). The primary endpoint was survival (death or unknown status) at 24 weeks after randomisation assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the primary endpoint across groups were compared by the z-test. All participants were included in the safety analysis of antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01380080.
Between Oct 31, 2011, and June 9, 2014, we enrolled 850 participants. Of these, we randomly assigned 424 to receive empirical tuberculosis therapy and 426 to the isoniazid preventive therapy group. The median CD4 cell count at baseline was 18 cells per μL (IQR 9-32). At week 24, 22 (5%) participants from each group died or were of unknown status (95% CI 3·5-7·8) for empirical group and for isoniazid preventive therapy (95% CI 3·4-7·8); absolute risk difference of -0·06% (95% CI -3·05 to 2·94). Grade 3 or 4 signs or symptoms occurred in 50 (12%) participants in the empirical group and 46 (11%) participants in the isoniazid preventive therapy group. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in 99 (23%) participants in the empirical group and 97 (23%) participants in the isoniazid preventive therapy group.
Empirical tuberculosis therapy did not reduce mortality at 24 weeks compared with isoniazid preventive therapy in outpatient adults with advanced HIV disease initiating antiretroviral therapy. The low mortality rate of the trial supports implementation of systematic tuberculosis screening and isoniazid preventive therapy in outpatients with advanced HIV disease.

In A Controlled Comparison of Eritoran and placebo in patients with Severe Sepsis and PROWESS-SHOCK, the average age of patients living at home independently was 63 and 61 years; 400 (34.9%) and 298 (30.2%) died by 6 months. In A Controlled Comparison of Eritoran and placebo in patients with Severe Sepsis, 580 patients had a quality of life measured using EQ-5D at 6 months. Of these, 41.6% could not live independently (22.7% were home but required help, 5.1% were in nursing home or rehabilitation facilities, and 5.3% were in acute care hospitals). Poor quality of life at 6 months, as evidenced by problems in mobility, usual activities, and self-care domains were reported in 37.4%, 43.7%, and 20.5%, respectively, and the high incidence of poor quality of life was also seen in patients in PROWESS-SHOCK.

26974162,"Promiscuous Recognition of a Trypanosoma cruzi CD8+ T Cell Epitope among HLA-A2, HLA-A24 and HLA-A1 Supertypes in Chagasic Patients.",,PloS one,"TcTLE is a nonamer peptide from Trypanosoma cruzi KMP-11 protein that is conserved among different parasite strains and that is presented by different HLA-A molecules from the A2 supertype. Because peptides presented by several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) supertypes are potential targets for immunotherapy, the aim of this study was to determine whether MHC molecules other than the A2 supertype present the TcTLE peptide.
From 36 HLA-A2-negative chagasic patients, the HLA-A genotypes of twenty-eight patients with CD8+ T cells that recognized the TcTLE peptide using tetramer (twenty) or functional (eight) assays, were determined. SSP-PCR was used to identify the A locus and the allelic variants. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the frequency of TcTLE-specific CD8+ T cells, and their functional activity (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-2, perforin, granzyme and CD107a/b production) was induced by exposure to the TcTLE peptide. All patients tested had TcTLE-specific CD8+ T cells with frequencies ranging from 0.07-0.37%. Interestingly, seven of the twenty-eight patients had HLA-A homozygous alleles: A*24 (5 patients), A*23 (1 patient) and A*01 (1 patient), which belong to the A24 and A1 supertypes. In the remaining 21 patients with HLA-A heterozygous alleles, the most prominent alleles were A24 and A68. The most common allele sub-type was A*2402 (sixteen patients), which belongs to the A24 supertype, followed by A*6802 (six patients) from the A2 supertype. Additionally, the A*3002/A*3201 alleles from the A1 supertype were detected in one patient. All patients presented CD8+ T cells producing at least one cytokine after TcTLE peptide stimulation.
These results show that TcTLE is a promiscuous peptide that is presented by the A24 and A1 supertypes, in addition to the A2 supertype, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy.",,,,2016-03-15,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

A crossover study was developed with a control session, followed by moderate and vigorous exercise sessions, with six days of monitoring each. Twenty-four adolescents, 11-13 years old, male and overweight were selected. Spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure was assessed by accelerometers. Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate the differences per session across time.
Energy expenditure during the 1st hour was different between all three sessions, with averages of 82, 286 and 343 kcal to the control, moderate and vigorous sessions, respectively (p <0.001). The same pattern of difference in energy expenditure between the sessions remained after 24 hours (704 vs 970 vs 1056 kcal, p <0.001). However, energy expenditure during the six days indicates compensation from second to the sixth day, although small differences remained at the end of the 6-day period (5102 vs 5193 vs 5271 kcal, p <0.001).
A single aerobic session seems to modify the spontaneous physical activities in overweight adolescents but still keeping the vigorous session with higher total energy expenditure during the follow-up period. Despite the observed compensatory effect, the greater energy expenditure observed in both moderate and vigorous exercise sessions indicates that physical activity should be recommended to promote an increased energy expenditure in adolescents.

26725037,Hormones and pathogenesis of uterine fibroids.,"estrogen, pathogenesis, progesterone, uterine leiomyoma",Best practice & research. Clinical obstetrics & gynaecology,"The role of ovarian steroid hormones in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids is supported by epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence. Estradiol and progesterone induce mature leiomyoma cells to release mitogenic stimuli to adjacent immature cells, thereby providing uterine leiomyoma with undifferentiated cells that are likely to support tumor growth. Progesterone action is required for the complete development and proliferation of leiomyoma cells, while estradiol predominantly increases tissue sensitivity to progesterone by increasing the availability of progesterone receptors (PRs). The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene and the selective PR modulators (SPRMs) mifepristone, asoprisnil, and ulipristal acetate have been shown in clinical trials to inhibit fibroid growth. The role of sex steroids is critical for leiomyoma development and maintenance, but a number of autocrine and paracrine messengers are involved in this process; hence, numerous pathways remain to be explored in therapeutic innovations for treating this common disease.",,,,2016-01-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
26719058,"Immunogenicity and safety of a novel monovalent high-dose inactivated poliovirus type 2 vaccine in infants: a comparative, observer-blind, randomised, controlled trial.",,The Lancet. Infectious diseases,"Following the proposed worldwide switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) to bivalent types 1 and 3 OPV (bOPV) in 2016, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) will be the only source of protection against poliovirus type 2. With most countries opting for one dose of IPV in routine immunisation schedules during this transition because of cost and manufacturing constraints, optimisation of protection against all poliovirus types will be a priority of the global eradication programme. We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a novel monovalent high-dose inactivated poliovirus type 2 vaccine (mIPV2HD) in infants.
This observer-blind, comparative, randomised controlled trial was done in a single centre in Panama. We enrolled healthy infants who had not received any previous vaccination against poliovirus. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive a single dose of either mIPV2HD or standard trivalent IPV given concurrently with a third dose of bOPV at 14 weeks of age. At 18 weeks, all infants were challenged with one dose of monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2). Primary endpoints were seroconversion and median antibody titres to type 2 poliovirus 4 weeks after vaccination with mIPV2HD or IPV; and safety (as determined by the proportion and nature of serious adverse events and important medical events for 8 weeks after vaccination). The primary immunogenicity analyses included all participants for whom a post-vaccination blood sample was available. All randomised participants were included in the safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02111135.
Between April 14 and May 9, 2014, 233 children were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive mIPV2HD (117 infants) or IPV (116 infants). 4 weeks after vaccination with mIPV2HD or IPV, seroconversion to poliovirus type 2 was recorded in 107 (93·0%, 95% CI 86·8-96·9) of 115 infants in the mIPV2HD group compared with 86 (74·8%, 65·8-82·4) of 115 infants in the IPV group (difference between groups 18·3%, 95% CI 5·0-31·1; p<0·0001), and median antibody titres against poliovirus type 2 were 181 (95% CI 72·0-362·0) in the mIPV2HD group and 36 (18·0-113·8) in the IPV group (difference between groups 98·8, 95% CI 60·7-136·9; p<0·0001). Serious adverse events were reported for six (5%) of 117 infants in the mIPV2HD group and seven (6%) of 116 infants in the IPV group during the 8-week period after vaccination; none were related to vaccination. No important medical events were reported.
Our findings lend support to the use of mIPV2HD as an option for stockpiling for outbreak response or primary protection in selected areas at risk for emergence of poliovirus type 2 during the next phase of the polio eradication plan.

Moreover, VT-1161 revealed a high level of antiparasitic activity against amastigotes of the Tulahuen strain of T. cruzi in cellular experiments (50% effective concentration, 2.5 nM) and was active in vivo, causing >99.8% suppression of peak parasitemia in a mouse model of infection with the naturally drug-resistant Y strain of the parasite. The data strongly support the potential utility of VT-1161 in the treatment of Chagas disease. The structural characterization of T. cruzi CYP51 in complex with VT-1161 provides insights into the molecular basis for the compound's inhibitory potency and paves the way for the further rational development of this novel, tetrazole-based inhibitory chemotype both for antiprotozoan chemotherapy and for antifungal chemotherapy.",,,,2015-12-09,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

New drugs and new delivery systems, including those based on nanotechnology, are being sought. Although vaccine development is still in its infancy, the reality of a therapeutic vaccine remains a challenge. New ECG methods may help to recognize patients prone to developing malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The management of heart failure, stroke and arrhythmias also remains a challenge.

26477622,Current and Future Chemotherapy for Chagas Disease.,,Current medicinal chemistry,"Human American trypanosomiasis, commonly called Chagas disease, is one of the most neglected illnesses in the world and remains one of the most prevalent chronic infectious diseases of Latin America with thousands of new cases every year. The only treatments available have been introduced five decades ago. They have serious, undesirable side effects and disputed benefits in the chronic stage of the disease - a characteristic and debilitating cardiomyopathy and/or megavisceras. Several laboratories have therefore focused their efforts in finding better drugs. Although recent years have brought new clinical trials, these are few and lack diversity in terms of drug mechanism of action, thus resulting in a weak drug discovery pipeline. This fragility has been recently exposed by the failure of two candidates; posaconazole and E1224, to sterilely cure patients in phase 2 clinical trials. Such setbacks highlight the need for continuous, novel and high quality drug discovery and development efforts to discover better and safer treatments. In this article we will review past and current findings on drug discovery for Trypanosoma cruzi made by academic research groups, industry and other research organizations over the last half century.

26436678,Course of Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi Infection after Treatment Based on Parasitological and Serological Tests: A Systematic Review of Follow-Up Studies.,,PloS one,"Chagas disease is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). It is endemic in Latin American countries outside the Caribbean. The current criterion for cure in the chronic phase of the disease is the negativization of at least two serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF) and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). The serological evolution of treated subjects with chronic T. cruzi infection is variable. Treatment failure is indicated by a positive parasitological and/or molecular test (persistence of parasitemia).
To summarize the pattern of response to treatment of parasitological, molecular and serological tests performed during the follow-up of subjects with chronic T. cruzi infection.
Electronic searches in relevant databases and screening of citations of potentially eligible articles were accomplished. Organizations focusing on neglected infectious diseases were asked for help in identifying relevant studies. Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cohort studies involving adults and children with chronic infection who received trypanocidal treatment (benznidazole or nifurtimox) and were followed over time. The assessment of risk of bias was performed separately for each study design. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the guidelines developed by Hayden et al. were used. Two reviewers extracted all data independently. A third review author was consulted in case of discordant opinion. Additional analyses were defined in ad-hoc basis. Scatter plots for percentage of positive parasitological and molecular tests and for negative serological tests were developed by using the lowess curve technique. Heterogeneity was measured by I2. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO, an international prospective register of systematic review protocols (Registration Number CRD42012002162).
Out of 2,136 citations screened, 54 studies (six RCTs and 48 cohort studies) were included. The smoothed curves for positive xenodiagnosis and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were characterized by a sharp decrease at twelve month posttreatment. Afterwards, they reached 10-20% and 40% for xenodiagnosis and PCR, respectively. The smoothed curves for negative conventional serological tests increased up to 10% after 48 months of treatment. In the long-term, the rate of negativization was between 20% and 45%. The main sources of bias identified across cohort studies were the lack of control for confounding and attrition bias. In general, RCTs were judged as low risk of bias in all domains. The level of heterogeneity across included studies was moderate to high. Additional analysis were incomplete because of the limited availability of data. In this regard, the country of origin of study participants might affect the results of parasitological and molecular tests, while the level of risk of bias might affect serological outcomes. Subgroup analysis suggested that seronegativization occurs earlier in children compared to adults.
We acknowledge that there is a dynamic pattern of response based on parasitological, molecular and serological tests in subjects chronically infected with T. cruzi after treatment.

Here, we investigated the effects of treatment with benznidazole (Bz) and with the potent experimental T. cruzi CYP51 inhibitor VNI in mouse models of Chagas disease by using different animal genders and parasite strains and employing distinct types of therapeutic schemes. Our findings confirm that female mice are less vulnerable to the infection than males, show that male models are less susceptible to treatment with both Bz and VNI, and thus suggest that male models are much more suitable for selection of the most promising antichagasic agents. Additionally, we have found that preventive protocols (compound given at 1 dpi) result in higher treatment success rates, which also should be avoided during advanced steps of in vivo trials of novel anti-T. cruzi drug candidates. Another consideration is the relevance of immunosuppression methods in order to verify the therapeutic profile of novel compounds, besides the usefulness of molecular diagnostic tools (quantitative PCR) to ascertain compound efficacy in experimental animals.

In Brazil, there is no information about the molecular epidemiology of HSV-1 infection, especially in HIV-infected individuals. The aim of this study was to perform the genotypic characterization of HSV-1 among HIV-infected patients. A total of 214 serum samples from HIV-positive patients without HSV infection symptoms were enrolled in one of two reference hospitals for HIV infection managing in Rio de Janeiro. The gG and gI genes were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and full nucleotide sequencing of the US8 (1601 bp), UL44 (1996 bp), and UL23 (1244 bp) regions was performed. A total of 38.3% (82/214) and 32.7% (70/214) of the serum samples tested positive for gG and gI genes, respectively. RFLP analysis classified the HSV-1 as belonging to genotype A.

The chikungunya virus, a Togaviridae member of the genusAlphavirus, reached the Americas in 2013 and, the following year, more than a million cases were reported. In Brazil, indigenous transmission was registered in Amapa and Bahia States, even during the period of low rainfall, exposing the whole country to the risk of virus spreading. Brazil is historically infested by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, also dengue vectors. Chikungunya may spread, and it is important to take measures to prevent the virus from becoming endemic in the country. Adequate care for patients with chikungunya fever requires training general practitioners, rheumatologists, nurses, and experts in laboratory diagnosis. Up to November 2014, more than 1,000 cases of the virus were reported in Brazil. There is a need for experimental studies in animal models to understand the dynamics of infection and the pathogenesis as well as to identify pathophysiological mechanisms that may contribute to identifying effective drugs against the virus. Clinical trials are needed to identify the causal relationship between the virus and serious injuries observed in different organs and joints. In the absence of vaccines or effective drugs against the virus, currently the only way to prevent the disease is vector control, which will also reduce the number of cases of dengue fever.

Exclusions were receiving vasoactive drug(s) prior to hospital admission, having known cardiac disease, having already participated in the trial during the same hospital stay, refusing to participate, or having do-not-resuscitate orders.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either dopamine (5-10 μg/kg/min) or epinephrine (0.1-0.3 μg/kg/min) through a peripheral or intraosseous line. Patients not reaching predefined stabilization criteria after the maximum dose were classified as treatment failure, at which point the attending physician gradually stopped the study drug and started another catecholamine.
Physiologic and laboratory data were recorded. Baseline characteristics were described as proportions and mean (± SD) and compared using appropriate statistical tests. Multiple regression analysis was performed, and statistical significance was defined as a p value of less than 0.05. Baseline characteristics and therapeutic interventions for the 120 children enrolled (63, dopamine; 57, epinephrine) were similar. There were 17 deaths (14.2%): 13 (20.6%) in the dopamine group and four (7%) in the epinephrine group (p=0.033). Dopamine was associated with death (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.1-37.8; p=0.037) and healthcare-associated infection (odds ratio, 67.7; 95% CI, 5.0-910.8; p=0.001). The use of epinephrine was associated with a survival odds ratio of 6.49.
Dopamine was associated with an increased risk of death and healthcare-associated infection. Early administration of peripheral or intraosseous epinephrine was associated with increased survival in this population. Limitations should be observed while interpreting these results.",,,,2015-09-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
26318714,"Inactivated poliovirus vaccine given alone or in a sequential schedule with bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine in Chilean infants: a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 4, non-inferiority study.",,The Lancet. Infectious diseases,"Bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV; types 1 and 3) is expected to replace trivalent OPV (tOPV) globally by April, 2016, preceded by the introduction of at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in routine immunisation programmes to eliminate vaccine-associated or vaccine-derived poliomyelitis from serotype 2 poliovirus. Because data are needed on sequential IPV-bOPV schedules, we assessed the immunogenicity of two different IPV-bOPV schedules compared with an all-IPV schedule in infants.
We did a randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial with healthy, full-term (>2·5 kg birthweight) infants aged 8 weeks (± 7 days) at six well-child clinics in Santiago, Chile. We used supplied lists to randomly assign infants (1:1:1) to receive three polio vaccinations (IPV by injection or bOPV as oral drops) at age 8, 16, and 24 weeks in one of three sequential schedules: IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, or IPV-IPV-IPV. We did the randomisation with blocks of 12 stratified by study site. All analyses were done in a masked manner. Co-primary outcomes were non-inferiority of the bOPV-containing schedules compared with the all-IPV schedule for seroconversion (within a 10% margin) and antibody titres (within two-thirds log2 titres) to poliovirus serotypes 1 and 3 at age 28 weeks, analysed in the per-protocol population. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion and titres to serotype 2 and faecal shedding for 4 weeks after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at age 28 weeks. Safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01841671, and is closed to new participants.
Between April 25 and August 1, 2013, we assigned 570 infants to treatment: 190 to IPV-bOPV-bOPV, 192 to IPV-IPV-bOPV, and 188 to IPV-IPV-IPV. 564 (99%) were vaccinated and included in the intention-to-treat cohort, and 537 (94%) in the per-protocol analyses. In the IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV groups, respectively, the proportions of children with seroconversion to type 1 poliovirus were 166 (98·8%) of 168, 95% CI 95·8-99·7; 178 (100%), 97·9-100·0; and 175 (100%), 97·9-100·0. Proportions with seroconvsion to type 3 poliovirus were 163 (98·2%) of 166, 94·8-99·4; 177 (100%), 97·9-100·0, and 172 (98·9%) of 174, 95·9-99·7. Non-inferiority was thus shown for the bOPV-containing schedules compared with the all-IPV schedule, with no significant differences between groups. In the IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV groups, respectively, the proportions of children with seroprotective antibody titres to type 1 poliovirus were 168 (98·8%) of 170, 95% CI 95·8-99·7; 181 (100%), 97·9-100·0; and 177 (100%), 97·9-100·0. Proportions to type 3 poliovirus were 166 (98·2%) of 169, 94·9-99·4; 180 (100%), 97·9-100·0; and 174 (98·9%) of 176, 96·0-99·7. Non-inferiority comparisons could not be done for this outcome because median titres for the groups receiving OPV were greater than the assay's upper limit of detection (log2 titres >10·5). The proportions of children seroconverting to type 2 poliovirus in the IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV groups, respectively, were 130 (77·4%) of 168, 95% CI 70·5-83·0; 169 (96·0%) of 176, 92·0-98·0; and 175 (100%), 97·8-100. IPV-bOPV schedules resulted in almost a 0·3 log reduction of type 2 faecal shedding compared with the IPV-only schedule. No participants died during the trial; 81 serious adverse events were reported, of which one was thought to be possibly vaccine-related (intestinal intussusception).
Seroconversion rates against polioviruses types 1 and 3 were non-inferior in sequential schedules containing IPV and bOPV, compared with an all-IPV schedule, and proportions of infants with protective antibodies were high after all three schedules. One or two doses of bOPV after IPV boosted intestinal immunity for poliovirus type 2, suggesting possible cross protection. Additionally, there was evidence of humoral priming for type 2 from one dose of IPV. Our findings could give policy makers flexibility when choosing a vaccination schedule, especially when trying to eliminate vaccine-associated and vaccine-derived poliomyelitis.

26316715,Translational challenges of animal models in Chagas disease drug development: a review.,"Trypanosoma cruzi, drug discovery, efficacy prediction, in vivo models, translation","Drug design, development and therapy","Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasite infection is endemic in Latin America and presents an increasing clinical challenge due to migrating populations. Despite being first identified over a century ago, only two drugs are available for its treatment, and recent outcomes from the first clinical trials in 40 years were lackluster. There is a critical need to develop new drugs to treat Chagas disease. This requires a better understanding of the progression of parasite infection, and standardization of animal models designed for Chagas disease drug discovery. Such measures would improve comparison of generated data and the predictability of test hypotheses and models designed for translation to human disease. Existing animal models address both disease pathology and treatment efficacy. Available models have limited predictive value for the preclinical evaluation of novel therapies and need to more confidently predict the efficacy of new drug candidates in clinical trials. This review highlights the overall lack of standardized methodology and assessment tools, which has hampered the development of efficacious compounds to treat Chagas disease. We provide an overview of animal models for Chagas disease, and propose steps that could be undertaken to reduce variability and improve predictability of drug candidate efficacy. New technological developments and tools may contribute to a much needed boost in the drug discovery process.",,,,2015-09-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
26239982,Antitrypanosomal Treatment with Benznidazole Is Superior to Posaconazole Regimens in Mouse Models of Chagas Disease.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Two CYP51 inhibitors, posaconazole and the ravuconazole prodrug E1224, were recently tested in clinical trials for efficacy in indeterminate Chagas disease. The results from these studies show that both drugs cleared parasites from the blood of infected patients at the end of the treatment but that parasitemia rebounded over the following months. In the current study, we sought to identify a dosing regimen of posaconazole that could permanently clear Trypanosoma cruzi from mice with experimental Chagas disease. Infected mice were treated with posaconazole or benznidazole, an established Chagas disease drug, and parasitological cure was defined as an absence of parasitemia recrudescence after immunosuppression. Twenty-day therapy with benznidazole (10 to 100 mg/kg of body weight/day) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in antiparasitic activity, and the 100-mg/kg regimen effected parasitological cure in all treated mice. In contrast, all mice remained infected after a 25-day treatment with posaconazole at all tested doses (10 to 100 mg/kg/day). Further extension of posaconazole therapy to 40 days resulted in only a marginal improvement of treatment outcome. We also observed similar differences in antiparasitic activity between benznidazole and posaconazole in acute T. cruzi heart infections. While benznidazole induced rapid, dose-dependent reductions in heart parasite burdens, the antiparasitic activity of posaconazole plateaued at low doses (3 to 10 mg/kg/day) despite increasing drug exposure in plasma. These observations are in good agreement with the outcomes of recent phase 2 trials with posaconazole and suggest that the efficacy models combined with the pharmacokinetic analysis employed here will be useful in predicting clinical outcomes of new drug candidates.",,,,2015-08-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
26239259,Most Heart Failure Patients Die from Pump Failure: Implications for Therapy.,,"American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions","Careful review of the literature of the last 20 years since the appearance of the first positive trials in heart failure indicates an evolution in the mode of death moving from sudden death to a predominance of pump failure death (i.e., death due to progression of heart failure). Pump failure is becoming a leading cause of mortality in a range of patient profiles, including patients with newly diagnosed or severe heart failure, patients with devices, and patients with heart failure associated with Chagas' disease. Indeed, the evidence suggests that modern management strategies, such as beta-blockers and devices, are successful in preventing sudden death. However, this means that optimally treated patients are at greater risk for the consequences of pump failure (death, hospitalization, and reduced quality of life). This highlights a new important unmet need in heart failure, and a priority for current research should be therapies that reduce pump failure death and hospitalization for more cost-effective management of the disease. Insofar as one-third of heart failure patients do not survive more than 3 years after diagnosis, properly addressing pump failure is an essential target in heart failure.",,,,2015-08-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
26203852,The use of posaconazole against Chagas disease.,,Current opinion in infectious diseases,"The current therapeutic scenario against Chagas disease has been recently updated with the use of the triazoles in clinical trials and several experimental assays (in-vitro and in-vivo models) which are bringing novel and promising evidence for the treatment of Chagas diseases, mainly in its chronic phase. We pretend to analyze all the evidence extracted from the in-vitro and in-vivo assays, and try to understand the poor outcome of posaconazole (POS) in the clinical experience.
POS is the drug with more advanced development in both experimental model and clinical trial. Despite the promising results initially obtained in the animal model, the clinical trial did not meet expectations. Nevertheless, it has documented the activity against Trypanosoma cruzi either in the animal model or in humans. Also new treatment strategies, combination or sequential schemes, have been evaluated in the animal model.
POS has been tested in humans showing activity against T. cruzi, but not enough to reach cure by itself. Those results represent one of the most important breakthroughs in the treatment of Chagas disease, and open a window to new strategies as combination therapies or even sequential treatments.",,,,2015-07-24,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Cardiovascular interventions,"This study aimed to assess 6-month outcomes in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) undergoing renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) for refractory ventricular arrhythmias (VAs).
ICDs are generally indicated for patients at high risk of malignant VAs. Sympathetic hyperactivity plays a critical role in the development, maintenance, and aggravation of VAs.
A total of 10 patients with refractory VA underwent RSD. Underlying conditions were Chagas disease (n = 6), nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 2), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 2). Information on the number of ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes and device therapies (antitachycardia pacing/shocks) in the previous 6 months as well as 1 and 6 months post-treatment was obtained from ICD interrogation.
The median number of VT/VF episodes/antitachycardia pacing/shocks 6 months before RSD was 28.5 (range 1 to 106)/20.5 (range 0 to 52)/8 (range 0 to 88), respectively, and was reduced to 1 (range 0 to 17)/0 (range 0 to 7)/0 (range 0 to 3) at 1 month and 0 (range 0 to 9)/0 (range 0 to 7)/0 (range 0 to 3) at 6 months afterward, respectively. There were no major procedure-related complications. Two patients experienced sustained VT within the first week; in both cases, no further episodes occurred during follow-up.

Twenty-one patients with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of either (i) anodal, (ii) cathodal or (iii) sham tDCS combined with mCIMT. Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), motor activity log scale (MAL), and handgrip strength were analyzed before, immediately, and 1 month (follow-up) after the treatment. Minimal clinically important difference (mCID) was defined as an increase of ≥5.25 in the upper limb FMA.
An increase in the FMA scores between the baseline and post-intervention and follow-up for active tDCS group was observed, whereas no difference was observed in the sham group. At post-intervention and follow-up, when compared with the sham group, only the anodal tDCS group achieved an improvement in the FMA scores. ANOVA showed that all groups demonstrated similar improvement over time for MAL and handgrip strength. In the active tDCS groups, 7/7 (anodal tDCS) 5/7 (cathodal tDCS) of patients experienced mCID against 3/7 in the sham group.
The results support the merit of association of mCIMT with brain stimulation to augment clinical gains in rehabilitation after stroke. However, the anodal tDCS seems to have greater impact than the cathodal tDCS in increasing the mCIMT effects on motor function of chronic stroke patients.

The objective of this proof-of-principle study was to explore, for the first time, effects of UH-LF-rTMS as add-on therapy to motor rehabilitation on short-term intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) of the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere (M1UH) in patients with ischemic stroke. Eighteen patients were randomized to receive, immediately before rehabilitation treatment, either active or sham UH-LF-rTMS, during two weeks. Resting motor threshold (rMT), SICI, and ICF were measured in M1UH before the first session and after the last session of treatment. There was a significant increase in ICF in the active group compared to the sham group after treatment, and there was no significant differences in changes in rMT or SICI. ICF is a measure of intracortical synaptic excitability, with a relative contribution of spinal mechanisms. ICF is typically upregulated by glutamatergic agonists and downregulated by gabaergic antagonists. The observed increase in ICF in the active group, in this hypothesis-generating study, may be related to M1UH reorganization induced by UH-LF-rTMS.",,,,2015-06-11,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Systemic administration of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMCs) has shown to be safe in lung diseases. However, so far, no studies have analyzed whether bronchoscopic instillation of autologous BMDMCs is a safe route of administration in patients with silicosis.
We conducted a prospective, non-randomized, single-center longitudinal study in five patients. Inclusion criteria were age 18-50 years, chronic and accelerated silicosis, forced expiratory volume in 1 s <60 % and >40 %, forced vital capacity ≥60 % and arterial oxygen saturation >90 %. The exclusion criteria were smoking, active tuberculosis, neoplasms, autoimmune disorders, heart, liver or renal diseases, or inability to undergo bronchoscopy. BMDMCs were administered through bronchoscopy (2 × 10(7) cells) into both lungs. Physical examination, laboratory evaluations, quality of life questionnaires, computed tomography of the chest, lung function tests, and perfusion scans were performed before the start of treatment and up to 360 days after BMDMC therapy. Additionally, whole-body and planar scans were evaluated 2 and 24 h after instillation.
No adverse events were observed during and after BMDMC administration. Lung function, quality of life and radiologic features remained stable throughout follow-up. Furthermore, an early increase of perfusion in the base of both lungs was observed and sustained after BMDMC administration.

The objective was to understand the distribution of low-level reactive samples using highly sensitive immunoassays and the relationship with epidemiologic evidence of exposure to T. cruzi.
Blood donors (BDs) were recruited in two blood banks located in Chaco province, in northeastern Argentina, from June 2006 to March 2007. Donors completed a Chagas exposure questionnaire and provided blood samples. All samples were tested in parallel with five contemporary and commercially available enzyme immunoassays for T. cruzi and a subgroup by a chemiluminescent assay.
Of the 1423 enrolled donors, 304 (21.4%) tested positive on all assays while 93 (6.5%) were reactive on at least one assay (inconclusive). Epidemiologic evidence of exposure to T. cruzi was significantly higher among positive and inconclusive donors compared to seronegative BD (p values range from 0.01 to <0.001 depending on the exposure).

Participants were HIV-1-infected partners randomized to early ART (CD4 350-550) in HPTN052 (n = 886, median follow-up = 2.1 years), a clinical trial of early ART to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1 in serodiscordant couples at 13 sites in 9 countries. Adherence was assessed through pill count (dichotomized at <95%) and through self-report items. Predictors of adherence were mental health and general health perceptions, substance use, binge drinking, social support, sexual behaviors, and demographics. Viral suppression was defined as HIV plasma viral load <400 copies per milliliter. Adherence counseling and couples' counseling about safer sex were provided. Logistic and linear regression models using generalized estimating equation for repeated measurements were used.
Through pill count, 82% of participants were adherent at 1 month and 83.3% at 1 year. Mental health was the only psychosocial variable associated with adherence [pill count, odds ratios (OR) = 1.05, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.00 to 1.11; self-report parameter estimate, OR = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.04], although regional differences emerged. Pill count (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.30) and self-report (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.77) adherence were associated with viral suppression.
Although adherence was high among individuals in stable relationships taking ART for prevention, mental health and adherence covaried. Assessing and intervening on mental health in the context of promoting adherence to ART as prevention should be explored. Adherence and couples' counseling, feedback about viral suppression, and/or altruism may also help explain the magnitude of adherence observed.",,,,2015-05-27,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
25992924,Health-related quality of life in patients with Chagas disease: a review of the evidence.,,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,"Chagas disease (ChD), a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), remains a serious public health issue in Latin America and is an emerging disease in several non-endemic countries, where knowledge of the condition and experience with its clinical management are limited. Regionally, the disease is the major cause of disability secondary to tropical diseases in young adults. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment is common in patients with ChD, especially in those with Chagas dilated cardiomyopathy, the most severe manifestation of the disease, which frequently leads to heart failure. The aim of this review was to conduct a literature search for studies that have evaluated the determining factors of HRQoL in ChD patients. We included cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, and experimental studies, as well as clinical trials that evaluated the HRQoL in ChD patients aged 18 to 60 years and are presenting an explicit description of statistical analysis. Using a combination of keywords based on Descriptors in Health Sciences (DeCS) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for searches in PubMed and the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), 148 studies were found. After exclusions, 12 studies were selected for analysis. Three main findings were extracted from these studies: 1) cardiac involvement is associated with a worse HRQoL in ChD patients; 2) HRQoL is associated with the patients' functional capacity; and 3) simple and inexpensive therapeutic measures are effective for improving HRQoL in ChD patients. Hence, ChD patients' functional capacity, the effectiveness of non-surgical conservative treatment, and cardiac involvement are important determining factors for the HRQoL in ChD patients.",,,,2015-05-21,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ICD and CRT-D therapies within the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).
All patients who underwent ICD or CRT-D implantation within the SUS from 2001 to 2007 were included in the study. We compared estimated Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the Peto's test. Prognostic factors were selected using Cox's models.
There were included 3,295 patients in the ICD group and 681 patients in the CRT-D group. Cardiac causes accounted for 79% of all deaths in both groups and Chagas' heart disease accounted for 31% of these deaths. In the CRT-D group, survival significantly decreased around the fourth year of follow-up, with a decrease from 59.5% to 38.3% in 5.5 months. Transvenous implantation technique was used in 62% of CRT-D patients. In-hospital case-fatality rates were higher in those undergoing surgical implantation (5.3%) than those undergoing transvenous implantation (1.6%) (p = 0.02).
The results show that short-term, medium-term and long-term effectiveness of ICD therapy appears to be similar to that evidenced in clinical trials. In the CRT-D group, in-hospital case-fatality and 30-day case-fatality were higher than those reported in other studies.

Notably, anemia and inflammation are interrelated, and recent studies have associated elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation marker, with adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment outcomes, yet their joint effect is not known. The objective of this study was to assess prevalence and risk factors of anemia in HIV infection and to determine whether anemia and elevated CRP jointly predict clinical failure post-ART.
A case-cohort study (N = 470 [236 cases, 234 controls]) was nested within a multinational randomized trial of ART efficacy (Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource Limited Settings [PEARLS]). Cases were incident World Health Organization stage 3, 4, or death by 96 weeks of ART treatment (clinical failure). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for pre-ART (baseline) anemia (females: hemoglobin <12.0 g/dL; males: hemoglobin <13.0 g/dL). Association of anemia as well as concurrent baseline anemia and inflammation (CRP ≥ 10 mg/L) with clinical failure were assessed using multivariable Cox models.
Baseline anemia prevalence was 51% with 15% prevalence of concurrent anemia and inflammation. In analysis of clinical failure, multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios were 6.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.82-14.57) for concurrent anemia and inflammation, 0.77 (95% CI, .37-1.58) for anemia without inflammation, and 0.45 (95% CI, .11-1.80) for inflammation without anemia compared to those without anemia and inflammation.
ART-naive, HIV-infected individuals with concurrent anemia and inflammation are at particularly high risk of failing treatment, and understanding the pathogenesis could lead to new interventions. Reducing inflammation and anemia will likely improve HIV disease outcomes. Alternatively, concurrent anemia and inflammation could represent individuals with occult opportunistic infections in need of additional screening.",,"Baseline anemia prevalence was 51% with 15% prevalence of concurrent anemia and inflammation.

25824212,Population pharmacokinetics of benznidazole in adult patients with Chagas disease.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"The aim of the present study was to build a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model to characterize benznidazole (BNZ) pharmacokinetics in adults with chronic Chagas disease. This study was a prospective, open-label, single-center clinical trial approved by the local ethics committee. Patients received BNZ at 2.5 mg/kg of body weight/12 h (Abarax, Elea Laboratory, Argentina) for 60 days. Plasma BNZ samples were taken several times during the study and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV-visible detection (HPLC-UV). The popPK analysis was done with NONMEMv.7.3. Demographic and biological data were tested as covariates. Intraindividual, interoccasion, and residual variabilities were modeled. Internal and external validations were completed to assess the robustness of the model. Later on, simulations were performed to generate BNZ concentration-time course profiles for different dosage regimens. A total of 358 plasma BNZ concentrations from 39 patients were included in the analysis. A one-compartment PK model characterized by clearance (CL/F) and the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), with first-order absorption (Ka) and elimination, adequately described the data (CL/F, 1.73 liters/h; V/F, 89.6 liters; and Ka, 1.15 h(-1)). No covariates were found to be significant for CL/F and V/F. Internal and external validations of the final model showed adequate results. Data from simulations revealed that a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/12 h might lead to overexposure in most patients. A lower dose (2.5 mg/kg/24 h) was able to achieve trough BNZ plasma concentrations within the accepted therapeutic range of 3 to 6 mg/liter. In summary, we developed a population PK model for BNZ in adults with chronic Chagas disease. Dosing simulations showed that a BNZ dose of 2.5 mg/kg/24 h will adequately keep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target range for the majority of patients.

Malnutrition associated with active CD has been reduced although obesity has increased. Dietary strategies such as those with high-protein have been proposed to reduce body fat. This study compares the effects of two supplements on the nutritional status of CD patients.
68 CD patients were randomized in two groups: whey protein group (WP) and soy protein group (SP). Using bioimpedance analysis, anthropometry and albumin and pre-albumin dosages the nutritional status was measured before starting the intervention and after 8 and 16 weeks. The disease activity was determined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index and serum C-reactive protein dosage and dietary intake by 24h dietary recalls.
Forty-one patients concluded the study and both supplements changed body composition similarly. Triceps skin fold thickness (p< 0.001) and body fat percentage (p=0.001) decreased, whereas mid-arm muscle circumference (p=0.004), corrected arm muscle area (p=0.005) and body lean percentage (p=0.001) increased.
For Crohn's disease patients undergoing anti TNF-alpha and azatioprine therapies, supplementation with whey and soy proteins changes body composition through reduction of body fat and thus contributes to control inflammation.

25787966,Sterol Biosynthesis Pathway as an Alternative for the Anti-Protozoan Parasite Chemotherapy.,,Current medicinal chemistry,"Sterols play an essential role in the physiology of eukaryotic cells; they play a pivotal role in the normal structure and function of cell membranes and also act as precursors for the synthesis of several different molecules like steroid hormones. Trypanosomatids and fungi have an essential requirement of ergosterol and other 24-alkyl sterols, which are absent in mammalian cells, for their survival and growth. At least 20 metabolic steps are necessary to synthesize sterols as cholesterol and ergosterol with the involvement of different specific enzymes. Some enzymes have been studied in detail in order to find new inhibitors that are able to abolish the parasite growth in vitro; besides, they also promote the curative efficacy in murine models of infection, thus opening new possibilities to introduce new drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease. Sterols biosynthesis inhibitors (SBIs) can potentially be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against trypanosomatids. Actually, there are several drugs that interfere with the SB pathway, and some of them are already in clinical trials, such as posaconazole, and a new pro-drug, the ravuconazole. Furthermore, new approaches are being used, such as the combination of drugs, to reduce the resistance and minimize toxic effects. In this review, we discuss the main steps of the SB pathway, showing each enzyme involved in the steps, as well as the antiproliferative, physiological, biochemical, and ultrastructural effects of the several known inhibitors.",,,,2015-03-20,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Drug repositioning (i.e. finding second or further therapeutic indications for known drugs) has raised considerable interest within the international drug development community. There are many explanations to the current interest on drug repositioning including the possibility to partially circumvent clinical trials and the consequent saving in time and resources. It has been suggested as a particular attractive approach for the development of novel therapeutics for neglected diseases, which are usually driven by public or non-profit organizations.

Alterations in cytokine receptor signal transduction have emerged as one of the cell-intrinsic mechanisms of T cell exhaustion. In this study, we performed an analysis of the expression of IL-7R components (CD127 and CD132) on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and evaluated IL-7-dependent signaling events in patients at different clinical stages of chronic chagasic heart disease. Subjects with no signs of cardiac disease showed a decrease in CD127(+)CD132(+) cells and a reciprocal gain of CD127(-)CD132(+) in CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells compared with either patients exhibiting heart enlargement or uninfected controls. T. cruzi infection, in vitro, was able to stimulate the downregulation of CD127 and the upregulation of CD132 on T cells. IL-7-induced phosphorylation of STAT5 as well as Bcl-2 and CD25 expression were lower in T. cruzi-infected subjects compared with uninfected controls. The serum levels of IL-7 were also increased in chronic chagasic patients.

We compared cases (participants with incident TB diagnosed by 96 weeks) to a random sample of controls (participants who did not develop TB, stratified by country and treatment arm).
We measured pre-ART C-reactive protein (CRP), EndoCab IgM, ferritin, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and CD4/DR+/38+ and CD8/DR+/38+ T cells.

The new generation of adjuvants is currently reversing this situation. Here, a new antigen-adjuvant combination for protection against experimental Chagas disease was assessed. The antigen used in the formulation was a glycosylated mutant inactive trans-sialidase (mTS) that was previously proven to be highly protective against Trypanosoma cruzi infection; here, we show that it can be produced in large quantities and high quality using Pichia pastoris. The adjuvant used in the formulation was ISCOMATRIX (IMX), which was found to be effective and safe in human clinical trials of vaccines designed to control other intracellular infections. Fifteen days after the third immunization, mice immunized with mTS-IMX showed a TS-specific IgG response with titers >10(6) and high avidity, an increased IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, significant delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactivity, a balanced production of IFN-γ and IL-10 by splenocytes and a strong IFN-γ secretion by CD8(+) T lymphocytes. When these mice where challenged with 1000 trypomastigotes of T. cruzi, all mTS-IMX immunized mice survived, whereas mice immunized with mTS alone, IMX or PBS exhibited high mortality. Remarkably, during acute infection, when the parasitemia is highest in this infection model (day 21), mTS-IMX immunized mice had ∼50 times less parasitemia than non-immunized mice. At this moment and also in the chronic phase, 100 days after infection, tissue presented ∼4.5 times lower parasite load and associated inflammatory infiltrate and lesions. These results indicate that protection against Chagas disease can be achieved by a protein antigen-adjuvant mTS formulation that is compatible with human medicine. Therefore, the current formulation is a highly promising T. cruzi vaccine candidate to be tested in clinical trials.",,,,2015-01-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

SQ109 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the trypomastigote form of the parasite, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for cell killing of 50 ± 8 nM, but it had little effect (50% effective concentration [EC50], ∼80 μM) in a red blood cell hemolysis assay. It also inhibited extracellular epimastigotes (IC50, 4.6 ± 1 μM) and the clinically relevant intracellular amastigotes (IC50, ∼0.5 to 1 μM), with a selectivity index of ∼10 to 20. SQ109 caused major ultrastructural changes in all three life cycle forms, as observed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It rapidly collapsed the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in succinate-energized mitochondria, acting in the same manner as the uncoupler FCCP [carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone], and it caused the alkalinization of internal acidic compartments, effects that are likely to make major contributions to its mechanism of action. The compound also had activity against squalene synthase, binding to its active site; it inhibited sterol side-chain reduction and, in the amastigote assay, acted synergistically with the antifungal drug posaconazole, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.48, but these effects are unlikely to account for the rapid effects seen on cell morphology and cell killing. SQ109 thus most likely acts, at least in part, by collapsing Δψ/ΔpH, one of the major mechanisms demonstrated previously for its action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Overall, the results suggest that SQ109, which is currently in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis, may also have potential as a drug lead against Chagas disease.",,,,2015-01-15,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of disease progression have identified the existence of adaptive ""cross-talk"" between the estrogen receptor (ER) and various growth factor receptor and intracellular signaling pathways, allowing breast cancer cells to escape the inhibitory effects of endocrine therapy. These findings provide the clinical rationale for enhancing or extending endocrine sensitivity by combining endocrine therapy with a targeted agent against a compensatory pathway. In BOLERO-2, adding the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to endocrine therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with HR(+) advanced breast cancer previously treated with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy. Notably, PFS benefits were comparable in subgroup analyses of first- and later-line settings. These results contrast with those of the large first-line HORIZON study, wherein adding the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus to endocrine therapy did not improve PFS. Therefore, it is unclear whether a targeted agent should only be combined with endocrine therapy to restore endocrine sensitivity or whether it may also prevent or delay resistance in hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer. Numerous additional targeted agents are currently being evaluated in combination with endocrine therapies, including PI3K, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6, SRC, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Appropriate patient selection based on prior treatment history will become increasingly important in maximizing the incremental benefit derived from these new agents combined with existing endocrine therapies in HR(+) advanced breast cancer.",,,,2015-01-13,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The aim of this study was to evaluate the BNP levels and to know its association within the systolic dysfunction level on Chagas disease. During the period 2010-2011, 64 patients were evaluated in the Chagas clinic of the Cardiopulmonary Unit of the University Hospital Dr. Luis Razetti, Barcelona-Anzoátegui state, Venezuela. After confirming the seropositive state to antibodies anti-T. cruzi with three inmunoserological tests (ELISA, indirect inmunofluorescence and indirect hemaglutination), patients were classified into Groups I, II and III of cardiac disease, by the evaluation with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and thorax radiography. Thirty three seronegative cardiological patients and eight healthy volunteers were included in the study as controls. BNP groups levels were as follow: Chagas I = 18.87 +/- 18.00 pg/mL (n=20), Chagas II = 99.88 +/- 171.52 pg/mL (n=24) y Chagas III = 365.80 +/- 280.54 pg/mL (n=20). The sensitivity and specificity of BNP were 85.0% and 93.2%, respectively, (p<0.0001; IC 95%), employing as parameter of reference the left ventricle fraction ejection (LVFE <40%), with a prognostic value of 89.0% (p=0.006). These results place the BNP in an equivalent position with the echocardiogram for the evaluation of cardiological patients, with the benefits of rapidity and simplicity, which makes the determination of this biochemical parameter a useful tool to perform field studies in endemic zones with limited access to the echocardiographic test.",,,,2015-01-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Posaconazole, the most advanced new anti-chagasic drug candidate, did not fully confirm its initial potential in a Phase II clinical trial for chronic Chagas' disease. Given that posaconazole is highly active against Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro, and was very well tolerated in clinical trials, it should not be abandoned. Rather, a combination therapy may provide a highly promising outlook. Systems-scale approaches facilitate the hunt for a combination partner for posaconazole, which acts by blocking sterol biosynthesis. Mounting evidence suggests the functional interactions between sterols and sphingolipids in vivo. Here, we propose combining sterol and sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitors to advance drug development in Chagas' disease.",,,,2014-12-10,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

However, there are no available data on the antioxidant effect after that supplementation. The objective of this work was to determine if the beneficial effects of one Brazil nut supplementation per day during 3 months for the HD patients could be sustained after 12 months. Twenty-nine HD patients (58.6 % men, 51.0 ± 3.3 years) from RenalCor Clinic, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were followed up 12 months after the supplementation study had finished. The plasma levels of antioxidant substances as selenium, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 8-isoprostane, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) were determined before, after 3 months of supplementation and after 12 months. After 3-months supplementation, cytokines, 8-OHdG and 8-isoprostane plasma levels have decreased and the activity of GPx and selenium plasma levels have increased significantly. Additionally, after 12 months, the values of 8-isoprostane, 8-OHdG and cytokines increased and the activity of GPx and selenium plasma levels decreased significantly.

Pregnant women are susceptible to the same adverse reactions to ARVs as nonpregnant adults as well as to specific pregnancy-related reactions. In addition, we should consider adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse reactions in children exposed to ARVs during intrauterine life. However, studies designed to assess the safety of ARV in pregnant women are rare, usually with few participants and short follow-up periods.
In this review, we discuss studies reporting adverse reactions to ARV drugs, including maternal toxicity, adverse pregnancy outcomes and the consequences of exposure to ARV in infants. We included results of observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, as well as randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Effective canine vaccines are therefore a highly desirable prevention tool. In this randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial, the efficacy of the LiESP/QA-21 vaccine (CaniLeish, Virbac, France) was assessed by exposing 90 naïve dogs to natural L. infantum infection during 2 consecutive transmission seasons, in two highly endemic areas of the Mediterranean basin. Regular PCR, culture, serological and clinical examinations were performed, and the infection/disease status of the dogs was classified at each examination. The vaccine was well-tolerated, and provided a significant reduction in the risk of progressing to uncontrolled active infection (p = 0.025) or symptomatic disease (p = 0.046), with an efficacy of 68.4% and a protection rate of 92.7%. The probability of becoming PCR positive was similar between groups, but the probability of returning to a PCR negative condition was higher in the vaccinated group (p = 0.04). In conclusion, we confirmed the interest of using this vaccine as part of a comprehensive control program for canine leishmaniasis, and validated the use of a protocol based on regular in-depth assessments over time to assess the efficacy of a canine leishmaniasis vaccine.",,,,2014-10-10,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

There is evidence that patients with Chagas heart disease have lower Se levels than healthy individuals and patients with T. cruzi infection without of cardiac disease. The aim of this investigation is to estimate the effect of Se treatment on prevention of heart disease progression in patients with chagasic cardiopathy.
The Selenium Treatment and Chagasic Cardiopathy trial is a superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The eligibility criteria are as follows: (1) a Chagas disease diagnosis confirmed by serology; (2) segmental, mild or moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and (3) age between 18 and 65 years. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) pregnancy, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) tobacco use, (4) alcohol abuse, (5) evidence of nonchagasic heart disease, (6) depression, (7) dysphagia with evidence of food residues in the esophagus, (8) dysphagia with weight loss higher than 15% of usual weight in the last four months and/or (9) conditions that may result in low protocol adherence. The intervention will be 100 μg of sodium selenite once daily for 365 consecutive days compared to placebo. The following are the primary outcomes to be measured: (1) the trajectories of the left ventricular ejection fraction in the follow-up period; (2) reduction of heart disease progression rates, with progression defined as a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction; and (3) rate of hospital admissions attributable to dysrhythmia, heart failure or stroke due to Chagas disease. One hundred thirty patients will be randomly allocated into either the intervention or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1. The sequence allocation concealment and blinding were planned to be conducted with the strategy of numbered boxes. Both patients and health-care providers will remain blinded to the intervention groups during the 5 years of follow-up.
If Se treatment reduces the progression of Chagas cardiopathy, the inclusion of this micronutrient in the daily diet can improve the therapeutic regimen for this neglected tropical disease at low cost.

A recent change in the scientific paradigm on the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas disease has led to a consensus that all T. cruzi-seropositive patients should receive etiological treatment. This important scientific advance has spurred the rigorous evaluation of the safety and efficacy of currently available drugs (benznidazole and nifurtimox) as well as novel anti-T. cruzi drug candidates in chronic patients, who were previously excluded from such treatment. The first results indicate that benznidazole is effective in inducing a marked and sustained reduction in the circulating parasites' level in the majority of these patients, but adverse effects can lead to treatment discontinuation in 10-20% of cases. Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, such as posaconazole and ravuconazole, are better tolerated but their efficacy at the doses and treatment duration used in the initial studies was significantly lower; such results are probably related to suboptimal exposure and/or treatment duration. Combination therapies are a promising perspective but the lack of validated biomarkers of response to etiological treatment and eventual parasitological cures in chronic patients remains a serious challenge.",,,,2014-10-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Treatment of adults is also effective in many cases, but discouraged in breastfeeding women because no information on BNZ transfer into breast milk is available. We aimed to evaluate the degree of BNZ transfer into breast milk in lactating women with Chagas disease.
Prospective cohort study of lactating women with Chagas disease treated with BNZ administered for 30 days. Patients and their breastfed infants were evaluated at admission, the 7th and 30th day of treatment (and monthly thereafter, for 6 months). BNZ was measured in plasma and milk by high performance liquid chromatography. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT01547533).
12 lactating women with chronic Chagas disease were enrolled (median age 28.5 years, range 20-34). Median BNZ dose was 5.65 mg/kg/day twice daily. Five mothers had adverse drug events (45%), but no adverse drug reactions or any untoward outcomes were observed in the breastfed infants. Median milk BNZ concentration was 3.8 mg/L (range 0.3-5.9) and 6.26 mg/L (range 0.3-12.6) in plasma. Median BNZ milk to plasma ratio was 0.52 (range 0.3-2.79).

Because of its distribution throughout Latin America, sometimes it can overlap with other parasitic diseases, such as leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania spp. This might represent a problem when performing serological diagnosis, because both parasites share antigens, resulting in cross-reactions. In the present work we evaluated Mexican sera samples: 83.8% of chagasic patients recognized at least one antigen of high molecular weight (>95 kDa) when evaluated by Western blot. Proteins of 130 kDa and 160 kDa are predominantly being recognized by asymptomatic chagasic patients. When the proteins were extracted using Triton X-100 detergent, a larger number of specific T. cruzi proteins were obtained. This protein fraction can be used to increase specificity to 100% in Western blot assays without losing sensitivity of the test. High molecular weight proteins of T. cruzi include glycoproteins with a great amount of αMan (α-mannose), αGlc (α-glucose), GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine), and αGal (α-galactose) content and these structures play an essential role in antigens recognition by antibodies present in patients' sera.",,,,2014-08-20,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

To evaluate the discriminatory efficiency of the commercial kit Chagas ( Trypanosoma cruzi ) IgG-ELISA ® (Nova Tec Immunodiagnostica GmbBH) in a group of Colombian individuals, using indirect immunofluorescence antibody testing (IFAT) and enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) tests as references.
Seventy-eight samples from chronic chagasic patients (36 asymptomatic and 42 symptomatic) and 21 healthy controls were included. Seventeen samples from non-infected people with Chagas' disease epidemiological risk, seven with leishmaniasis and nine with non-chagasic cardiomyopathy were also analyzed. Real time PCR was performed on four individuals whose results differed among tests.
Significant differences at 450 nm optical absorbance were found (p<0.0001) when the median absorbance values of healthy controls (0.143), asymptomatic (2.401) and symptomatic (2.776) chagasic patients were compared, as well as when asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (p=0.0408) and seronegative people with epidemiological risk (0.232), cardiomyopathy (0.367) or leishmaniasis (0.337) were compared with chagasic patients (p<0.0001).

24867876,Trypanocidal drugs for chronic asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi infection.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Prevention of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) by treating infected populations with trypanocidal therapy (TT) remains a challenge. Despite a renewed enthusiasm for TT, uncertainty regarding its efficacy, concerns about its safety and limited availability remain barriers for a wider use of conventional drugs. We have updated a previous version of this review.
To systematically search, appraise, identify and extract data from eligible studies comparing the outcome of cohorts of seropositive individuals to Trypanosoma cruzi exposed to TT versus placebo or no treatment.
We sought eligible studies in electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 1, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to January week 5 2014); EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 2014 week 6) and LILACS (up to 6 May 2010)) by combining terms related with the disease and the treatment. The search also included a Google search, handsearch for references in review or selected articles, and search of expert files. We applied no language restrictions.
Review authors screened the retrieved references for eligibility (those dealing with human participants treated with TT) and then assessed the pre-selected studies in full for inclusion. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that provided data on either mortality or clinical progression of CCC after at least four years of follow-up.
Teams of two review authors independently carried out the study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, with a referee resolving disagreement within the pairs. Data collection included study design, characteristics of the population and interventions or exposures and outcome measures. We defined categories of outcome data as parasite-related (positive serology, xenodiagnosis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after TT) and participant-related (including efficacy outcomes such as progression towards CCC, all-cause mortality and side effects of TT). We reported pooled outcome data as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) or standardised mean differences (SMD) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a random-effects model. I(2) statistics provided an estimate of heterogeneity across studies. We conducted an exploratory meta-regression analysis of the relationship between positive-serology and progression of CCC or mortality.
We included 13 studies involving 4229 participants (six RCTs, n = 1096, five RCTs of intermediate risk of bias, one RCT of high risk of bias; four non-randomised experiments, n = 1639 and three observational studies, n = 1494). Ten studies tested nitroderivative drugs nifurtimox or benznidazole (three exposed participants to allopurinol, one to itraconazole). Five studies were conducted in Brazil, five in Argentina, one in Bolivia, one in Chile and one in Venezuela.TT was associated with substantial, but heterogeneous reductions on parasite-related outcomes such as positive serology (9 studies, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.44, I(2) = 76%), positive PCR (2 studies, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.92, I(2) = 0%), positive xenodiagnosis after treatment (6 studies, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.86, I(2) = 79%), or reduction on antibody titres (3 studies, SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23, I(2) = 28%). Efficacy data on patient-related outcomes was largely from non-RCTs. TT with nitroderivatives was associated with potentially important, but imprecise and inconsistent reductions in progression of CCC (4 studies, 106 events, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.73, I(2) = 66%) and mortality after TT (6 studies, 99 events, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14, I(2) = 48%). The overall median incidence of any severe side effects among 1475 individuals from five studies exposed to TT was 2.7%, and the overall discontinuation of this two-month therapy in RCTs (5 studies, 134 events) was 20.5% (versus 4.3% among controls) and 10.4% in other five studies (125 events).
Despite the evidence that TT reduced parasite-related outcomes, the low quality and inconsistency of the data for patient-important outcomes must be treated with caution. More geographically diverse RCTs testing newer forms of TT are warranted in order to 1. estimate efficacy more precisely, 2. explore factors potentially responsible for the heterogeneity of results and 3. increase knowledge on the efficacy/tolerance balance of conventional TT.",,,,2014-05-29,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
24853169,Population pharmacokinetic study of benznidazole in pediatric Chagas disease suggests efficacy despite lower plasma concentrations than in adults.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, can lead to long term cardiac morbidity. Treatment of children with benznidazole is effective, but no pediatric pharmacokinetics data are available and clinical pharmacology information on the drug is scarce.
Prospective population pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort study in children 2-12 years old with Chagas disease treated with oral benznidazole 5-8 mg/kg/day BID for 60 days. (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00699387).
Forty children were enrolled in the study. Mean age was 7.3 years. A total of 117 samples were obtained from 38 patients for PK analysis. A one compartment model best fit the data. Weight-corrected clearance rate (CL/F) showed a good correlation with age, with younger patients having a significantly higher CL/F than older children and adults. Simulated median steady-state benznidazole concentrations, based on model parameters, were lower for children in our study than for adults and lowest for children under 7 years of age. Treatment was efficacious in the 37 patients who completed the treatment course, and well tolerated, with few, and mild, adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
Observed benznidazole plasma concentrations in children were markedly lower than those previously reported in adults (treated with comparable mg/kg doses), possibly due to a higher CL/F in smaller children. These lower blood concentrations were nevertheless associated to a high therapeutic response in our cohort. Unlike adults, children have few adverse reactions to the drug, suggesting that there may be a direct correlation between drug concentrations and incidence of ADRs. Our results suggest that studies with lower doses in adults may be warranted.

Posaconazole has shown trypanocidal activity in murine models.
We performed a prospective, randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of posaconazole as compared with the efficacy and safety of benznidazole in adults with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. We randomly assigned patients to receive posaconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (high-dose posaconazole), posaconazole at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (low-dose posaconazole), or benznidazole at a dose of 150 mg twice daily; all the study drugs were administered for 60 days. We assessed antiparasitic activity by testing for the presence of T. cruzi DNA, using real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-PCR) assays, during the treatment period and 10 months after the end of treatment. Posaconazole absorption was assessed on day 14.
The intention-to-treat population included 78 patients. During the treatment period, all the patients tested negative for T. cruzi DNA on rt-PCR assay beyond day 14, except for 2 patients in the low-dose posaconazole group who tested positive on day 60. During the follow-up period, in the intention-to-treat analysis, 92% of the patients receiving low-dose posaconazole and 81% receiving high-dose posaconazole, as compared with 38% receiving benznidazole, tested positive for T. cruzi DNA on rt-PCR assay (P<0.01 for the comparison of the benznidazole group with either posaconazole group); in the per-protocol analysis, 90% of the patients receiving low-dose posaconazole and 80% of those receiving high-dose posaconazole, as compared with 6% receiving benznidazole, tested positive on rt-PCR assay (P<0.001 for the comparison of the benznidazole group with either posaconazole group).

24805062,Mutagenicity of N-oxide containing heterocycles and related compounds: experimental and theoretical studies.,,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,"In the development of new drugs, it is very important to know the effects these may bring to those who consume them. Drugs which act upon certain diseases must not cause toxic side effects on healthy organs. These toxic side effects can be quite varied, i.e. mutagenicity, clastogenicity, teratogenicity, etc., but undoubtedly the mutagenicity officiate in the selection process, during preclinical testing, to advance in clinical trials. Mutagenic compounds are removed and cannot continue its development. There are preclinical studies of mutagenicity and genotoxicity, ranging from in vitro to in vivo studies. Particularly, Ames test is recommended by ICH as the first input in these studies. Herein, we investigated the mutagenicity of an in-house chemical library of eighty five N-oxide containing heterocycles using Ames test in Salmonella thyphimurium TA 98 with and without S9 activation and the use of neural networks in order to predict this nondesired activity. N-oxide containing heterocycles are especially relevant regarding its pharmacological activities as antitrypanosoma, anti-leishmania, anti-tuberculosis, anti-cancer, chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, and analgesic agents. In some cases, a relationship was found between the presence of N-oxide and mutagenicity. Specifically, benzofuroxan system seems to be responsible for the mutagenicity of certain agents against Chagas disease and certain anti-inflammatory agents. However other N-oxides, such as furoxans with anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis activities, seem to lack mutagenicity. In other cases, such as quinoxaline dioxides with anti-parasitic activity, mutagenicity shows to be substituent dependent. Applying CODES neural network two models were defined, one without metabolism and other with metabolism. These models predict the mutagenicity with and without metabolism in an excellent manner.",,,,2014-05-09,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Of these, the HLA-B alleles are considered the strongest genetic determinant of disease outcome. We evaluated the influence of the HLA-B alleles on AIDS progression among HIV-1-positive individuals from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who were categorized as rapid progressors (RPs), typical progressors (TPs) or long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). In this study, significant differences in HLA-B allele frequencies were observed among the three progression groups for the B*48, B*49 and B*52 alleles. After controlling for other factors associated with AIDS progression, the presence of the B*52 allele was shown to be a significant protective factor (hazard ratio (HR) 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.90) P<0.03). Although no direct association was observed between the presence of the B*27 or B*57 allele and the LTNP profile compared with the TP or RP groups, the adjusted model confirmed that these alleles are protective factors against AIDS progression (HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.38-0.99) P<0.05), as previously described.

Infectious diseases,"Use of antiretroviral treatment for HIV-1 infection has decreased AIDS-related morbidity and mortality and prevents sexual transmission of HIV-1. However, the best time to initiate antiretroviral treatment to reduce progression of HIV-1 infection or non-AIDS clinical events is unknown. We reported previously that early antiretroviral treatment reduced HIV-1 transmission by 96%. We aimed to compare the effects of early and delayed initiation of antiretroviral treatment on clinical outcomes.
The HPTN 052 trial is a randomised controlled trial done at 13 sites in nine countries. We enrolled HIV-1-serodiscordant couples to the study and randomly allocated them to either early or delayed antiretroviral treatment by use of permuted block randomisation, stratified by site. Random assignment was unblinded. The HIV-1-infected member of every couple initiated antiretroviral treatment either on entry into the study (early treatment group) or after a decline in CD4 count or with onset of an AIDS-related illness (delayed treatment group). Primary events were AIDS clinical events (WHO stage 4 HIV-1 disease, tuberculosis, and severe bacterial infections) and the following serious medical conditions unrelated to AIDS: serious cardiovascular or vascular disease, serious liver disease, end-stage renal disease, new-onset diabetes mellitus, and non-AIDS malignant disease. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00074581.
1763 people with HIV-1 infection and a serodiscordant partner were enrolled in the study; 886 were assigned early antiretroviral treatment and 877 to the delayed treatment group (two individuals were excluded from this group after randomisation). Median CD4 counts at randomisation were 442 (IQR 373-522) cells per μL in patients assigned to the early treatment group and 428 (357-522) cells per μL in those allocated delayed antiretroviral treatment. In the delayed group, antiretroviral treatment was initiated at a median CD4 count of 230 (IQR 197-249) cells per μL. Primary clinical events were reported in 57 individuals assigned to early treatment initiation versus 77 people allocated to delayed antiretroviral treatment (hazard ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·52-1·03; p=0·074). New-onset AIDS events were recorded in 40 participants assigned to early antiretroviral treatment versus 61 allocated delayed initiation (0·64, 0·43-0·96; p=0·031), tuberculosis developed in 17 versus 34 patients, respectively (0·49, 0·28-0·89, p=0·018), and primary non-AIDS events were rare (12 in the early group vs nine with delayed treatment). In total, 498 primary and secondary outcomes occurred in the early treatment group (incidence 24·9 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 22·5-27·5) versus 585 in the delayed treatment group (29·2 per 100 person-years, 26·5-32·1; p=0·025). 26 people died, 11 who were allocated to early antiretroviral treatment and 15 who were assigned to the delayed treatment group.
Early initiation of antiretroviral treatment delayed the time to AIDS events and decreased the incidence of primary and secondary outcomes. The clinical benefits recorded, combined with the striking reduction in HIV-1 transmission risk previously reported, provides strong support for earlier initiation of antiretroviral treatment.

Chagas disease disrupts blood microcirculation via various autoimmune mechanisms, causing loss of cardiomyocytes and severe impairment of heart function. Different cell types and delivery approaches in Chagas Disease have been studied in both preclinical models and clinical trials. The main objective of this article is to clarify the reasons why the benefits that have been seen with cell therapy in preclinical models fail to translate to the clinical setting. This can be explained by crucial differences between the cellular types and pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, as well as the differences between human patients and animal models. We discuss examples that demonstrate how the results from preclinical trials might have overestimated the efficacy of myocardial regeneration therapies. Future research should focus, not only on studying the best cell type to use but, very importantly, understanding the levels of safety and cellular interaction that can elicit efficient therapeutic effects in human tissue. Addressing the challenges associated with future research may ensure the success of stem cell therapy in improving preclinical models and the treatment of Chagas disease.",,,,2014-01-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
24391801,Outcomes among HIV-1 infected individuals first starting antiretroviral therapy with concurrent active TB or other AIDS-defining disease.,,PloS one,"Tuberculosis (TB) is common among HIV-infected individuals in many resource-limited countries and has been associated with poor survival. We evaluated morbidity and mortality among individuals first starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) with concurrent active TB or other AIDS-defining disease using data from the ""Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource-Limited Settings"" (PEARLS) study.
PARTICIPANTS WERE CATEGORIZED RETROSPECTIVELY INTO THREE GROUPS ACCORDING TO PRESENCE OF ACTIVE CONFIRMED OR PRESUMPTIVE DISEASE AT ART INITIATION: those with pulmonary and/or extrapulmonary TB (""TB"" group), those with other non-TB AIDS-defining disease (""other disease""), or those without concurrent TB or other AIDS-defining disease (""no disease""). Primary outcome was time to the first of virologic failure, HIV disease progression or death. Since the groups differed in characteristics, proportional hazard models were used to compare the hazard of the primary outcome among study groups, adjusting for age, sex, country, screening CD4 count, baseline viral load and ART regimen.
31 of 102 participants (30%) in the ""TB"" group, 11 of 56 (20%) in the ""other disease"" group, and 287 of 1413 (20%) in the ""no disease"" group experienced a primary outcome event (p = 0.042). This difference reflected higher mortality in the TB group: 15 (15%), 0 (0%) and 41 (3%) participants died, respectively (p<0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio comparing the ""TB"" and ""no disease"" groups was 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-2.10; p = 0.11) for the primary outcome and 3.41 (1.72-6.75; p<0.001) for death.

24370375,β1-selective adrenoceptor antagonists increase plasma levels of anti-p2β antibodies and decrease cardiac involvement in chronic progressive Chagas heart disease.,,The Canadian journal of cardiology,"Studies indicate that antibodies cross-reacting with cardiac β1 adrenergic receptors are likely to play a role in the development of chronic Chagas heart disease (CCHD). In parallel, clinical trials have shown that β1 antagonist drugs exert beneficial effects in the prognosis of patients with CCHD. In a group of patients with CCHD undergoing therapy with β1-blockers, we have now evaluated the levels of anti-p2β antibodies and the severity of CCHD.
We performed a cross-sectional study in Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive patients categorized according to a standard CCHD classification. All individuals were subjected to a complete clinical examination.
There was no association between CCHD stages, electrocardiographic conduction disturbances, and echocardiogram pathological signs with the levels of autoantibodies. However, when patients were analyzed according to selective cardio-β1-blocker therapy, those receiving treatment had higher levels of anti-p2β. Patients from CCHD stage III treated with combined therapy of cardio-β1-selective blockers, enalapril, and statins, presented decreased cardiac involvement and lower score of risk of mortality than individuals from the same group who were not treated.
Our results suggest that selective cardio-β1-blockers might modify the autoantibody anti-p2β levels, and that combined therapy in patients with stage III CCHD might be associated with lower cardiac involvement and risk score of mortality in patients with heart failure.

The aim here was to investigate the risk of recurrence of CIN II/III among HIV-infected women (HIV+) and uninfected women in a cohort treated by means of large-loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).
Cohort study conducted at Instituto Fernandes Figueira/Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (IFF/Fiocruz).
60 HIV+ and 209 HIV-negative patients were included in a cohort for follow-up after undergoing LLETZ to treat CIN II/III. A histopathological diagnosis of CIN II/III during the follow-up was taken to constitute recurrence. The following possible confounding variables were assessed: age at treatment and at end of follow-up; histological grade of intraepithelial disease treated; surgical margin involvement; adequacy of colposcopy during the follow-up; CD4+ lymphocyte count; HIV viral load; and type of antiretroviral therapy.
Among the 60 HIV+ women, six showed recurrent disease during the follow-up. However, among the 209 HIV-negative women, seven showed a new precursor lesion. The relative risk of disease recurrence in the HIV+ women was 4.21 (95% CI = 1.42 to 12.43). The Kaplan-Meyer curve showed that the risk of recurrence was significantly higher among HIV+ women (log-rank test: P = 0.0111).

24312535,Endothelial transmigration by Trypanosoma cruzi.,,PloS one,"Chagas heart disease, the leading cause of heart failure in Latin America, results from infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Although T. cruzi disseminates intravascularly, how the parasite contends with the endothelial barrier to escape the bloodstream and infect tissues has not been described. Understanding the interaction between T. cruzi and the vascular endothelium, likely a key step in parasite dissemination, could inform future therapies to interrupt disease pathogenesis. We adapted systems useful in the study of leukocyte transmigration to investigate both the occurrence of parasite transmigration and its determinants in vitro. Here we provide the first evidence that T. cruzi can rapidly migrate across endothelial cells by a mechanism that is distinct from productive infection and does not disrupt monolayer integrity or alter permeability. Our results show that this process is facilitated by a known modulator of cellular infection and vascular permeability, bradykinin, and can be augmented by the chemokine CCL2. These represent novel findings in our understanding of parasite dissemination, and may help identify new therapeutic strategies to limit the dissemination of the parasite.",,,,2013-12-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
24300620,Cell-based therapies for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.,,Current opinion in critical care,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a multifaceted lung disease with no current effective therapy. Many clinical trials using conventional pharmacologic therapies have failed, suggesting the need to examine alternative approaches. Thus, attention has focused on the therapeutic potential of cell-based therapies for ARDS, with promising results demonstrated in relevant preclinical disease models. We review data concerning the therapeutic promise of cell-based therapies for ARDS.
Recent experimental studies provide further evidence for the potential of cell-based therapies in ARDS. A number of cell types, particularly mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells, endothelial progenitor cells, and embryonic stem cells have been demonstrated to reduce mortality and modulate the inflammatory and remodeling processes in relevant preclinical ARDS models. Multiple insights have emerged in regard to the mechanisms by which cell therapies - particularly MSCs - exert their effects, with evidence supporting direct cell-mediated and paracrine-mediated mechanisms of action. Diverse paracrine mechanisms exist, including the release of cytokines, growth factors (such as keratinocyte growth factor), and antimicrobial peptides, and transfer of cellular contents such as peptides, nucleic acids, and mitochondria via either microvesicular or direct cell-cell contact-mediated transfer.
Cell-based therapies offer considerable promise for the treatment of ARDS. While MSC-based therapies are being rapidly advanced toward clinical testing, clear therapeutic potential exists for other cell types for ARDS. A greater understanding of current knowledge gaps should further enhance the therapeutic potential of cell-based therapies for ARDS.",,,,2013-12-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
24276645,Stem cell therapy for the treatment of parasitic infections: is it far away?,,Parasitology research,"Stem cell therapy is an interventional treatment that introduces new cells into damaged tissues, which help in treating many diseases and injuries. It has been proved that stem cell therapy is effective for the treatment of cancers, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and many other diseases. Recently, stem cell therapy has been introduced to treat parasitic infections. The culture supernatant of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is found to inhibit activation and proliferation of macrophages induced by the soluble egg antigen of Schistosoma japonicum, and MSC treatment relieves S. japonicum-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mouse models. In addition, transplantation of MSCs into naïve mice is able to confer host resistance against malaria, and MSCs are reported to play an important role in host protective immune responses against malaria by modulating regulatory T cells. In mouse models of Chagas disease, bone marrow mononuclear cell has been shown effective in reducing inflammation and fibrosis in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, and transplantation of the bone marrow mononuclear cells prevents and reverses the right ventricular dilatation induced by T. cruzi infection in mice. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrate that transplantation of bone marrow derived-cells may become an important therapeutic modality in the management of end-stage heart diseases associated with Chagas disease. Based on these exciting results, it is considered by stating that it is firmly believed that, within the next few years, we will be able to find the best animal models and the appropriate stem cell type, stem cell number, injection route, and disease state that will result in possible benefits for the patients with parasitic infections, and stem cell therapy, although at an initial stage currently, will become a real therapeutic option for parasitic diseases.",,,,2013-11-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
24271041,Fibronectin modulates thymocyte-thymic epithelial cell interactions following Trypanosoma cruzi infection.,,Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,"Developing thymocytes interact with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) through cell-cell interactions, TEC-derived secretory moieties and extracellular matrix (ECM)-mediated interactions. These physiological interactions are crucial for normal thymocyte differentiation, but can be disrupted in pathological situations. Indeed, there is severe thymic atrophy in animals acutely infected with Trypanosoma cruzi due to CD4+CD8+ thymocyte depletion secondary to caspase-mediated apoptosis, together with changes in ECM deposition and thymocyte migration. We studied an in vitro model of TEC infection by T. cruzi and found that infected TEC cultures show a reduced number of cells, which was likely associated with decreased proliferative capacity, but not with increased cell death, as demonstrated by bromodeoxyuridine and annexin-V labelling. The infected TEC cultures exhibited increased expression of fibronectin (FN), laminin (LM) and type IV collagen. Importantly, treatment with FN increased the relative number of infected cells, whereas treatment with anti-FN or anti-LM antibodies resulted in lower infection rates. Consistent with these data, we observed increased thymocyte adhesion to infected TEC cultures. Overall, these results suggest that ECM molecules, particularly FN, facilitate infection of the thymic epithelium and that the consequent enhancement of ECM expression might be associated with changes in TEC-thymocyte interactions.",,,,2013-11-26,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This study aims to assess whether the ICD also has this effect for primary prevention in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC).
In this randomized (concealed allocation) open-label trial, we aim to enroll up to 1,100 patients with CCC, a Rassi risk score for death prediction of ≥10 points, and at least 1 episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on a 24-hour Holter monitoring. Patients from 28 centers in Brazil will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an ICD or amiodarone (600 mg/d for 10 days, then 200-400 mg/d until the end of the study). The randomization sequence will be generated by computer, and the members of the committees responsible for end point validation and data analysis will be blinded to study assignment. The primary end point is all-cause death, and enrolment will continue until 256 patients have reached this end point. Key secondary end points include cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death, hospitalization for heart failure, and quality of life. We expect follow-up to last 3 to 6 years, and data analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01722942.

24247135,Towards a paradigm shift in the treatment of chronic Chagas disease.,,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Treatment for Chagas disease with currently available medications is recommended universally only for acute cases (all ages) and for children up to 14 years old. The World Health Organization, however, also recommends specific antiparasite treatment for all chronic-phase Trypanosoma cruzi-infected individuals, even though in current medical practice this remains controversial, and most physicians only prescribe palliative treatment for adult Chagas patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The present opinion, prepared by members of the NHEPACHA network (Nuevas Herramientas para el Diagnóstico y la Evaluación del Paciente con Enfermedad de Chagas/New Tools for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Chagas Disease Patients), reviews the paradigm shift based on clinical and immunological evidence and argues in favor of antiparasitic treatment for all chronic patients.

24216069,Effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,,Trials,"Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is an inflammatory disease that occurs in approximately 30% of patients infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and it has a profile of high morbidity and mortality. The worst prognosis and the progression of this cardiomyopathy are associated with an exacerbated immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which also occur in other cardiomyopathies. Some nutrients, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), promote the inhibition and/or stimulation of cytokine production. The objective of this trial is to study the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the inflammatory response and lipid profile in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.
This is a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients that will be conducted at a reference unit for Chagas disease patients, where the patients will be selected. The study will include patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who are 18 years of age or older. The exclusion criteria are (a) ongoing diarrheal disease, (b) inflammatory bowel disease, (c) diabetes or other endocrine disease, (d) use of fibrates, niacin, or statins, (e) use of anti-inflammatory drugs, (f) pregnant and lactating women, (g) use of vitamin, mineral, or omega-3 supplementation during the previous 30 days, (h) hospital admission during the study, and (i) other associated cardiomyopathies. The intervention will be treatment with omega-3 PUFAs at a dose of 3 g/day for 8 weeks, compared to placebo (corn oil). The primary endpoints will be the concentrations of inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interferon (IFN)γ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)β). Secondary endpoints will be the fasting glucose, lipid, and anthropometric profiles. For statistical analysis, we plan to run either a t test or Wilcoxon test (numerical variables) and Pearson's χ2 or Fisher's exact test (categorical data), as appropriate.
Evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory action of omega-3 PUFAs may have beneficial effects on chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, as shown for other cardiomyopathies, due to improved control of the inflammatory response. At the end of the study, we predict that patients will have lower inflammatory markers and an improved metabolic and anthropometric profile.

24120609,Surveillance of Chagas disease among at-risk blood donors in Italy: preliminary results from Umberto I Polyclinic in Rome.,,Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,"Chagas disease is a parasitic disease due to Trypanosoma cruzi, endemic in Central and Southern America, where the protozoon infects about 8-10 million people. In rural areas the infection is acquired mostly through reduviidae insect vectors, whereas in urban ones it is acquired mainly through the transfusion of blood products, vertical transmission and organ transplantation. The important migratory flows of the last decades have focused attention on possible T. cruzi transmission by transfusion also in non-endemic countries, and platelets have been recognised as the main origin of infection for recipients from serologically-positive Latino-American donors.
In order to avoid the occurrence of transfusion-related cases, in 2010 systematic screening for anti-T. cruzi antibodies was started at the Umberto I Polyclinic in Rome, controlling blood donors born and/or coming from Latin-American countries in which the disease is endemic. The aim of this paper is to report the preliminary results achieved since the introduction of this screening.
Anti-T. cruzi antibodies have been detected to date in 3.9% out of the 128 people examined. A seropositive subject also proved positive by polymerase chain reaction analysis and showed very light parasitaemia.

In 2012, two antimycotic drugs inhibitors of fungal sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) - posaconazole and ravuconazole - entered clinical trials. Availability of the X-ray structure of the orthologous enzyme from the causative agent of the disease, protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, determined in complexes with posaconazole as well as with several experimental protozoa-specific CYP51 inhibitors opens an excellent opportunity to improve the situation.
This article summarizes the information available in PubMed and Google on the outcomes of treatment of the chronic Chagas disease. It also outlines the major features of the T. cruzi CYP51 structure and the possible structure-based strategies for rational design of novel T. cruzi specific drugs.
There is no doubt that screenings for alternative drug-like molecules as well as mining the T. cruzi genome for novel drug targets are of great value and might eventually lead to groundbreaking discoveries. However, all newly identified molecules must proceed through the long, expensive and low-yielding drug optimization process, and all novel potential drug targets must be validated in terms of their essentiality and druggability. CYP51 is already a well-validated and highly successful target for clinical and agricultural antifungals. With minimal investments into the final stages of their development/trials, T. cruzi-specific CYP51 inhibitors can provide an immediate treatment for Chagas disease, either on their own or in combination with the currently available drugs.",,,,2013-10-02,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Adult Chagas disease patients initiating 60-days of benznidazole were randomized to weekly or twice-weekly evaluations of medication adherence and screening for adverse drug events (ADEs). Mid-week evaluations employed phone-based evaluations. Adherence was measured by self-report, pill counts with intentional over-distribution, and Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS). Prospective data were compared to historical controls treated with benznidazole at the same hospital.
162 prospective patients were compared to 172 historical patients. Pill counts correlated well with MEMS data (R = 0.498 for 7-day intervals, R = 0.872 for intervals >7 days). Treatment completion rates were higher among prospective than historical patients (82.1% vs. 65.1%), primarily due to lower abandonment rates. Rates of ADEs were lower among prospective than historical patients (56.8% vs. 66.9%). Twice-weekly evaluations increased identification of mild ADEs, prompting higher suspension rates than weekly evaluations.

Azole inhibitors of sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) were proven effective against Chagas, and antifungal drugs posaconazole and ravuconazole have entered clinical trials in Spain, Bolivia, and Argentina. Here we present the x-ray structures of T. cruzi CYP51 in complexes with two alternative drug candidates, pyridine derivatives (S)-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(pyridin-3-yl)ethanone (UDO; Protein Data Bank code 3ZG2) and N-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-N-[1-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]-4-piperi-dyl]pyridin-3-amine (UDD; Protein Data Bank code 3ZG3). These compounds have been developed by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and are highly promising antichagasic agents in both cellular and in vivo experiments. The binding parameters and inhibitory effects on sterol 14α-demethylase activity in reconstituted enzyme reactions confirmed UDO and UDD as potent and selective T. cruzi CYP51 inhibitors. Comparative analysis of the pyridine- and azole-bound CYP51 structures uncovered the features that make UDO and UDD T. cruzi CYP51-specific. The structures suggest that although a precise fit between the shape of the inhibitor molecules and T. cruzi CYP51 active site topology underlies their high inhibitory potency, a longer coordination bond between the catalytic heme iron and the pyridine nitrogen implies a weaker influence of pyridines on the iron reduction potential, which may be the basis for the observed selectivity of these compounds toward the target enzyme versus other cytochrome P450s, including human drug-metabolizing P450s. These findings may pave the way for the development of novel CYP51-targeted drugs with optimized metabolic properties that are very much needed for the treatment of human infections caused by eukaryotic microbial pathogens.",,,,2013-09-21,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

BCG or saline were intradermally or intranasally injected one or two months before the induction of asthma. Mice were further sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin or received saline. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, BCG prevented the triggering of pro-inflammatory cytokines, probably by increasing Foxp3 and interleukin (IL)-10, modulating eosinophil infiltration and collagen fiber deposition, thus reducing airway hyperresponsiveness. In conclusion, BCG-Moreau prevented lung remodeling in the present model of allergic asthma, regardless of administration route and time of vaccination.

23638197,Mode of death on Chagas heart disease: comparison with other etiologies. a subanalysis of the REMADHE prospective trial.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Sudden death has been considered the main cause of death in patients with Chagas heart disease. Nevertheless, this information comes from a period before the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure. We sought to study the mode of death of patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, comparing with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy.
We examined the REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas vs non-Chagas) and mode of death. The primary end-point was all-cause, heart failure and sudden death mortality; 342 patients were analyzed and 185 (54.1%) died. Death occurred in 56.4% Chagas patients and 53.7% non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In the Cox regression model, Chagas etiology (HR 2.76; CI 1.34-5.69; p = 0.006), LVEDD (left ventricular end diastolic diameter) (HR 1.07; CI 1.04-1.10; p<0.001), creatinine clearance (HR 0.98; CI 0.97-0.99; p = 0.006) and use of amiodarone (HR 3.05; CI 1.47-6.34; p = 0.003) were independently associated with heart failure mortality. LVEDD (HR 1.04; CI 1.01-1.07; p = 0.005) and use of beta-blocker (HR 0.52; CI 0.34-0.94; p = 0.014) were independently associated with sudden death mortality.
In severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These data challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications in the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death.

Virtually all of the 2.4 billion people who live on less than $2 per d, more than a third of the world's population, are at risk for these debilitating NTDs. Although chemotherapeutic measures exist for many of these pathogens, they are not sustainable countermeasures on their own because of rates of reinfection, risk of drug resistance, and inconsistent maintenance of drug treatment programs. Preventative and therapeutic NTD vaccines are needed as long-term solutions. Because there is no market in the for-profit sector of vaccine development for these pathogens, much of the effort to develop vaccines is driven by nonprofit entities, mostly through product development partnerships. This review describes the progress of vaccines under development for many of the NTDs, with a specific focus on those about to enter or that are currently in human clinical trials.

Four treatments were randomly assigned to peridomiciles within each community: 5% SC beta-cypermethrin at standard (S, 50 mg active ingredient [AI]/m2) and double dose (2S), and 2.5% SC deltamethrin at standard (D, 25 mg [AI]/m2) and double dose (2D). Simultaneously, we assessed the effects of both pyrethroids applied at standard doses against domestic infestations. Bug infestation at the site level was assessed by timed manual collections with a dislodging agent at baseline, 13 and 21 mo postspraying (MPS). In domiciles, D and S nearly suppressed all T. infestans infestations up to 21 MPS. In peridomestic sites infested before interventions, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that site-level reinfestation at 13 MPS was significantly lower for treatment 2D (1%) than for other treatments, whereas 2S (6%), D (5%), and S (14%) did not differ significantly between them. The risk of reinfestation after spraying was significantly greater in goat or pig corrals than in other peridomestic ecotopes (in which treatments did not differ significantly), and in sites infested before interventions than in uninfested sites. The application of SC deltamethrin at double dose in goat or pig corrals may suppress T. infestans foci and achieve more sustained effects in the dry Chaco.",,,,2013-04-02,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
23487538,Toxic cardiomyopathy leading to fatal acute cardiac failure related to vandetanib: a case report with histopathological analysis.,,European journal of endocrinology,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) accounts for 3-4% of all malignant thyroid neoplasias. Vandetanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and RET, has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic MTC. The heart seems to be particularly susceptible to adverse effects associated with TKI therapy, and virtually all TKIs have been associated with cardiovascular events.
We report the case of a patient with metastatic MTC who was enrolled in the Phase III clinical study (NCT00410761) and presented a favorable response to vandetanib therapy, displaying marked decrease in the level of serologic tumor markers and shrinkage of metastatic lesions. After 14 months of therapy, the patient developed a fatal cardiac failure. Myocardial infarction was excluded by serial measurements of specific cardiac markers (serial troponin-T measurements varied from 0.037 to 0.042 ng/ml) and serologic tests for Chaga's disease were negative. Postmortem examination of the heart revealed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and marked myocyte degeneration in the subendocardial zones and papillary muscles of the myocardium. These pathological changes are similar to those observed in TKI-treated rats and are suggestive of drug-induced cardiotoxicity.
This case illustrates a previously unreported serious vandetanib-related adverse effect and highlights the need for close monitoring of patients under TKI therapy in order to identify early signs of congestive heart failure or myocardium damage.",,,This case illustrates a previously unreported serious vandetanib-related adverse effect and highlights the need for close monitoring of patients under TKI therapy in order to identify early signs of congestive heart failure or myocardium damage.,2013-03-15,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
23350012,Antigenicity and diagnostic potential of vaccine candidates in human Chagas disease.,,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US and Europe. We have shown TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 antigens elicit protective immunity to T. cruzi in mice and dogs. Herein, we investigated antigenicity of the recombinant proteins in humans to determine their potential utility for the development of next generation diagnostics for screening of T. cruzi infection and Chagas disease.
Sera samples from inhabitants of the endemic areas of Argentina-Bolivia and Mexico-Guatemala were analyzed in 1(st)-phase for anti-T. cruzi antibody response by traditional serology tests; and in 2(nd)-phase for antibody response to the recombinant antigens (individually or mixed) by an ELISA. We noted similar antibody response to candidate antigens in sera samples from inhabitants of Argentina and Mexico (n=175). The IgG antibodies to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 (individually) and TcG(mix) were present in 62-71%, 65-78% and 72-82%, and 89-93% of the subjects, respectively, identified to be seropositive by traditional serology. Recombinant TcG1- (93.6%), TcG2- (96%), TcG4- (94.6%) and TcG(mix)- (98%) based ELISA exhibited significantly higher specificity compared to that noted for T. cruzi trypomastigote-based ELISA (77.8%) in diagnosing T. cruzi-infection and avoiding cross-reactivity to Leishmania spp. No significant correlation was noted in the sera levels of antibody response and clinical severity of Chagas disease in seropositive subjects.
Three candidate antigens were recognized by antibody response in chagasic patients from two distinct study sites and expressed in diverse strains of the circulating parasites. A multiplex ELISA detecting antibody response to three antigens was highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing T. cruzi infection in humans, suggesting that a diagnostic kit based on TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 recombinant proteins will be useful in diverse situations.",,,,2013-01-26,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This study was conducted in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Serological screening was carried out in pregnant women, and parasites were sought in the blood of newborns from seropositive mothers. Infected infants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Recovery was assessed by parasite seeking at 1 month and 2 months as well as serological tests at 9 months. Assessment of treatment adherence was based on weekly home visits and use of electronic monitors.
Benznidazole was given to 63 newborns in group A (5 mg/kg in two daily doses for 60 days) and 61 newborns in group B (7.5 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 30 days).

The objective of this study was to evaluate LT-alpha genetics and its biological role in chronic Chagas' disease. A total of 284 subjects were studied. The LT-alpha single-nucleotide polymorphism (+252) was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in culture supernatants and in individual T lymphocytes by flow cytometry. The risk of developing the cardiac form was 2.8 times higher among carriers of genotype GG and 2.4 times among carriers of genotype GA when compared to subjects carrying genotype AA. Seropositive subjects carrying the G allele produced significantly higher levels of LT-alpha. The cytokine was mainly expressed by CD8(+) T lymphocytes in the absence of any stimulus and after stimulation with the Trypanosoma cruzi antigen.

23277882,Recent Developments in Sterol 14-demethylase Inhibitors for Chagas Disease.,,International journal for parasitology. Drugs and drug resistance,"The protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, causes the most prevalent parasitic infection in the American continent. It gives rise to life-long infection in humans and results in severe cardiomyopathy or other life-threatening manifestations (Chagas disease) in ~30% of those infected. Animal models and clinical studies indicate that etiological treatment of the infection reduces the risk of developing the disease manifestations. Unfortunately, the existing chemotherapeutics have suboptimal antiparasitic activity and cause significant side effects in many patients, thus better anti-trypanosomal drugs are greatly needed. The sterol biosynthesis pathway has received attention as a target for the development of new drugs for Chagas disease. In particular, inhibitors of sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) are shown to be extremely active on Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in animal models. Antifungal drugs (i.e. azoles) in clinical use or in clinical studies have been extensively tested preclinically on Trypanosoma cruzi with posaconazole and ravuconazole demonstrating the most promising activity. As a result, posaconazole and a pro-drug of ravuconazole (E1224) are currently being evaluated in Phase II studies for Chagas disease. Additional CYP51 inhibitors that are specifically optimized for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity are in development by academia. These represent an alternative to proprietary antifungal drugs if the latter fall short in clinical trials or are too expensive for widespread clinical use in disease endemic countries. The research over the next few years will help define the role of CYP51 inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs, for managing patients with Chagas disease.",,,,2013-01-02,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
23270509,Impact of pharmaceutical care on the quality of life of patients with Chagas disease and heart failure: randomized clinical trial.,,Trials,"Pharmaceutical care is the direct interaction between pharmacist and patient, in order to improve therapeutic compliance, promote adequate pharmacotherapeutic follow-up, and improve quality of life. Pharmaceutical care may be effective in reducing complications and in improving the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases, like Chagas heart disease, while bringing a positive impact on health system costs. The morbidity and mortality indexes for patients with Chagas heart disease are high, especially if this heart disease is complicated by heart failure. In this setting, we hypothesize that pharmaceutical care might be an important tool for the clinical management of these patients by improving their quality of life, as a better compliance to their treatment and the avoidance and prompt correction of drug-related problems will minimize their symptoms, improve their functional class, and decrease the number of hospital admissions. Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the contribution of pharmaceutical care to clinical treatment of patients with Chagas heart disease complicated by heart failure.
A prospective, single-center randomized clinical trial will be conducted in patients with Chagas heart disease complicated by heart failure. A total of 88 patients will be randomly assigned into two parallel groups: an intervention group will receive standard care and pharmaceutical care, and a control group will receive only standard care. Both groups will be subjected to a follow-up period of 12 months. The primary outcome of this trial is the evaluation of quality of life, measured by the 36-item short-form and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include drug-related problems, exercise tolerance as measured by the standard six-minute-walk test, and compliance.
Patients with Chagas heart disease complicated by heart failure under pharmaceutical care are expected to improve their quality of life, present with a lower incidence of drug-related problems, improve their functional capacity, and improve in their compliance to treatment.

23245604,Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.,,"Lancet (London, England)","Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.
We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.
In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1%) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9% since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6%) compared with two decades earlier (8·8%). This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted.
Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

Despite the substantial burden to the healthcare system, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas disease.
To assess the benefits and harms of current pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) Issue 1, 2011, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS and ISI Web of Science to April 2011. We checked the reference lists of included papers. No language restrictions were applied.
We included randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of pharmacological interventions for treating heart failure in adult patients (≥18 years) with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II to IV), irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction stage, reduced or preserved, with Chagas cardiomyopathy. No limits were applied with respect to the follow-up duration. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality at 30 days, time to heart decompensation and disease-free period (at 30, 60 and 90 days), and adverse events.
Two authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We estimated relative risks (RR) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. We used a fixed-effect model to synthesize the findings. We contacted authors for additional data.
We included two randomized clinical trials involving 69 participants. Both trials compared carvedilol against placebo, and had a high risk of bias. Carvedilol compared with placebo did not significantly affect all-cause mortality (2/34 (5.88%) versus 3/35 (5.87%); pooled RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.88, I(2) = 0%). None of the trials reported on cardiovascular mortality, time to heart decompensation or disease-free period. Evidence on the adverse effects of carvedilol is inconclusive.
This Cochrane review has found a lack of evidence on the effects of carvedilol for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas disease. The two included trials were underpowered and had a high risk of bias. There are no conclusive data to support the use of carvedilol for treating Chagas cardiomyopathy. Unless randomized clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect, and the trade off between potential benefits and harms is established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should be cautious when recommending and administering carvedilol for treating heart failure in patients with Chagas disease.

Herein, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate the tolerance and side effects of a sequential combined treatment of two antiparasitic drugs, allopurinol and benznidazole, in the chronic phase of Trypanosoma cruzi infection.
Changes in total and T. cruzi-specific T and B cells were monitored during a median follow-up of 36 months. Allopurinol was administered for 3 months (600 mg/day) followed by 30 days of benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day) in 11 T. cruzi-infected subjects.
The combined sequential treatment of allopurinol and benznidazole was well tolerated. The levels of T. cruzi-specific antibodies significantly decreased after sequential combined treatment, as determined by conventional serology and by a multiplex assay using recombinant proteins.

A panel of five primer sets directed to the T. cruzi nuclear satellite DNA repeats (Sat-DNA) and to the minicircle DNA conserved regions (kDNA) was compared in either SYBR Green or TaqMan systems. Standard curve parameters such as, amplification efficiency, coefficient of determination and intercept were evaluated, as well as different procedures to generate standard samples containing pre-established T. cruzi DNA concentration. Initially, each primer set was assayed in a SYBR Green qPCR to estimate parasite load in GEB samples from chronic Chagas disease patients. The results achieved from Bayesian transmutability analysis elected the primer sets Cruzi1/Cruzi2 (p=0.0031) and Diaz7/Diaz8 (p=0.0023) coupled to the QIAamp DNA Kit extraction protocol (silica gel column), as the most suitable for monitoring parasitemia in these patients. Comparison between the parasite burden of 150 GEB samples of BENEFIT patients from Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, prior to drug/placebo administration, was performed using Cruzi1/Cruzi2 primers in a SYBR Green approach. The median parasitemia found in patients from Argentina and Colombia (1.93 and 2.31 parasite equivalents/mL, respectively) was around 20 times higher than the one estimated for the Brazilian patients (0.1 parasite equivalents/mL). This difference could be in part due to the complexity of T. cruzi genetic diversity, which is a factor possibly implicated in different clinical presentations of the disease and/or influencing parasitemia levels in infected individuals from different regions of Latin America. The results of SYBR Green qPCR assays herein presented prove this methodology to be more cost efficient than the alternative use of internal fluorogenic probes. In addition, its sensitivity and reproducibility are shown to be adequate to detect low parasitemia burden in patients with chronic Chagas disease.",,,,2012-09-18,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

It is endemic in Latin America and the disease is being spread to developed countries as a result of the migration of infected individuals. In its chronic stage, Chagas disease can lead to a severe cardiomyopathy for which there is currently no cure. End-stage patients require heart transplantation, thus demanding new therapeutic modalities. Cell-based therapy has been proposed as an alternative for various forms of heart disease. Here we review the experimental evidence that led to the use of bone marrow-derived cells in putative therapy for chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy in animal models and in clinical trials, discussing the reasons for failure of the translation of results from mice to men.",,,,2012-09-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
22848457,Trypanosoma cruzi IV causing outbreaks of acute Chagas disease and infections by different haplotypes in the Western Brazilian Amazonia.,,PloS one,"Chagas disease is an emergent tropical disease in the Brazilian Amazon Region, with an increasing number of cases in recent decades. In this region, the sylvatic cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, which constitutes a reservoir of parasites that might be associated with specific molecular, epidemiological and clinical traits, has been little explored. The objective of this work is to genetically characterize stocks of T. cruzi from human cases, triatomines and reservoir mammals in the State of Amazonas, in the Western Brazilian Amazon.
We analyzed 96 T. cruzi samples from four municipalities in distant locations of the State of Amazonas. Molecular characterization of isolated parasites from cultures in LIT medium or directly from vectors or whole human blood was performed by PCR of the non-transcribed spacer of the mini-exon and of the 24 S alfa ribosomal RNA gene, RFLP and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene, and by sequencing of the glucose-phosphate isomerase gene. The T. cruzi parasites from two outbreaks of acute disease were all typed as TcIV. One of the outbreaks was triggered by several haplotypes of the same DTU. TcIV also occurred in isolated cases and in Rhodnius robustus. Incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies is likely to be indicative of historical genetic exchange events resulting in mitochondrial introgression between TcIII and TcIV DTUs from Western Brazilian Amazon. TcI predominated among triatomines and was the unique DTU infecting marsupials.
DTU TcIV, rarely associated with human Chagas disease in other areas of the Amazon basin, is the major strain responsible for the human infections in the Western Brazilian Amazon, occurring in outbreaks as single or mixed infections by different haplotypes.",,,,2012-08-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
22847166,Diagnosis and management of Chagas disease and cardiomyopathy.,,Nature reviews. Cardiology,"Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most severe and life-threatening manifestation of human Chagas disease--a 'neglected' tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is endemic in all continental Latin American countries, but has become a worldwide problem because of migration of infected individuals to developed countries, mainly in Europe and North America. Chagas cardiomyopathy results from the combined effects of persistent parasitism, parasite-driven tissue inflammation, microvascular and neurogenic dysfunction, and autoimmune responses triggered by the infection. Clinical presentation varies widely according to the extent of myocardial damage, and manifests mainly as three basic syndromes that can coexist in an individual patient: heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. NYHA functional class, left ventricular systolic function, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are important prognostic markers of the risk of death. Management of Chagas cardiomyopathy focuses on the treatment of the three main syndromes. The use of β-blockers in patients with Chagas disease and heart failure is safe, well tolerated, and should be encouraged. Most specialists and international institutions now recommend specific antitrypanosomal treatment of patients with chronic Chagas disease, even in the absence of evidence obtained from randomized clinical trials. Further research on the management of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy is necessary.",,,,2012-08-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and persistence of the immune response after vaccination against pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm09) with an adjuvanted vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults using two single and two double doses.
Open label, randomized trial to evaluate the immune response following H1N1pdm09 vaccination in HIV-infected participants compared to HIV-negative controls (NCT01155037). HIV-infected participants were randomized to receive 2 single (3.75 µg hemagglutinin) or 2 double (7.5 µg hemagglutinin) doses of the vaccine, 21 days apart. Controls received one dose of the vaccine. The primary endpoint was seroconversion as measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Two hundred fifty six HIV-infected participants (129 and 127 randomized to single and double doses, respectively) and 71 HIV-negative controls were enrolled. Among HIV-infected participants, seroconversion increased from 46.7% and 51.7% after the first dose to 77.2% and 83.8% after the second dose of the vaccine using single and double doses, respectively. Participants aged >40 years showed higher seroconversion compared to younger participants. Seroconversion among HIV-infected women and those with nadir CD4<200 cells/mm(3) was significantly higher with double doses. Persistence of protective antibodies six months after vaccination was achieved by 80% and 89.9% of the HIV-infected participants who received single and double doses, respectively.
Our results support the recommendation of two double doses of adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine for HIV-infected individuals, particularly women, and those aged >40 years or with nadir CD4<200 cells/mm(3), to achieve antibody levels that are both higher and more sustained.

The poor efficacy and unfavorable side effects of current treatments necessitate novel therapeutics. Cruzain, the major cysteine protease of T. cruzi, is one potential novel target. Recent advances in a class of vinyl sulfone inhibitors are encouraging; however, as most potential therapeutics fail in clinical trials and both disease progression and resistance call for combination therapy with several drugs, the identification of additional classes of inhibitory molecules is essential.

We report the results of the first randomized trial of BMNC therapy in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.
Patients 18 to 75 years of age with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35, and optimized therapy were randomized to intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs or placebo. The primary end point was the difference in LVEF from baseline to 6 and 12 months after treatment between groups. Analysis was by intention to treat and powered to detect an absolute between-group difference of 5. Between July 2005 and October 2009, 234 patients were enrolled. Two patients abandoned the study and 49 were excluded because of protocol violation. The remaining 183 patients, 93 in the placebo group and 90 in the BMNC group, had a trimmed mean age of 52.4 years (range, 50.8-54.0 years) and LVEF of 26.1 (range, 25.1-27.1) at baseline. Median number of injected BMNCs was 2.20×10(8) (range, 1.40-3.50×10(8)). Change in LVEF did not differ significantly between treatment groups: trimmed mean change in LVEF at 6 months, 3.0 (1.3-4.8) for BMNCs and 2.5 (0.6-4.5) for placebo (P=0.519); change in LVEF at 12 months, 3.5 (1.5-5.5) for BMNCs and 3.7 (1.5-6.0) for placebo (P=0.850). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, New York Heart Association functional class, Minnesota quality-of-life questionnaire, brain natriuretic peptide concentrations, and 6-minute walking test did also not differ between groups.

22238578,Cardiac-oxidized antigens are targets of immune recognition by antibodies and potential molecular determinants in chagas disease pathogenesis.,,PloS one,"Trypanosoma cruzi elicits reactive oxygen species (ROS) of inflammatory and mitochondrial origin in infected hosts. In this study, we examined ROS-induced oxidative modifications in the heart and determined whether the resultant oxidized cardiac proteins are targets of immune response and of pathological significance in Chagas disease. Heart biopsies from chagasic mice, rats and human patients exhibited, when compared to those from normal controls, a substantial increase in protein 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl, and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) adducts. To evaluate whether oxidized proteins gain antigenic properties, heart homogenates or isolated cardiomyocytes were oxidized in vitro and one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE)/Western blotting (WB) was performed to investigate the proteomic oxidative changes and recognition of oxidized proteins by sera antibodies in chagasic rodents (mice, rats) and human patients. Human cardiomyocytes exhibited LD(50) sensitivity to 30 µM 4-HNE and 100 µM H(2)O(2) at 6 h and 12 h, respectively. In vitro oxidation with 4-HNE or H(2)O(2) resulted in a substantial increase in 4-HNE- and carbonyl-modified proteins that correlated with increased recognition of cardiac (cardiomyocytes) proteins by sera antibodies of chagasic rodents and human patients. 2D-GE/Western blotting followed by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis to identify cardiac proteins that were oxidized and recognized by human chagasic sera yielded 82 unique proteins. We validated the 2D-GE results by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and WB and demonstrated that oxidation of recombinant titin enhanced its immunogenicity and recognition by sera antibodies from chagasic hosts (rats and humans). Treatment of infected rats with phenyl-α-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN, antioxidant) resulted in normalized immune detection of cardiac proteins associated with control of cardiac pathology and preservation of heart contractile function in chagasic rats.

22091400,"Experimental Chemotherapy for Chagas Disease: A Morphological, Biochemical, and Proteomic Overview of Potential Trypanosoma cruzi Targets of Amidines Derivatives and Naphthoquinones.",,Molecular biology international,"Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, affects approximately eight million individuals in Latin America and is emerging in nonendemic areas due to the globalisation of immigration and nonvectorial transmission routes. Although CD represents an important public health problem, resulting in high morbidity and considerable mortality rates, few investments have been allocated towards developing novel anti-T. cruzi agents. The available therapy for CD is based on two nitro derivatives (benznidazole (Bz) and nifurtimox (Nf)) developed more than four decades ago. Both are far from ideal due to substantial secondary side effects, limited efficacy against different parasite isolates, long-term therapy, and their well-known poor activity in the late chronic phase. These drawbacks justify the urgent need to identify better drugs to treat chagasic patients. Although several classes of natural and synthetic compounds have been reported to act in vitro and in vivo on T. cruzi, since the introduction of Bz and Nf, only a few drugs, such as allopurinol and a few sterol inhibitors, have moved to clinical trials. This reflects, at least in part, the absence of well-established universal protocols to screen and compare drug activity. In addition, a large number of in vitro studies have been conducted using only epimastigotes and trypomastigotes instead of evaluating compounds' activities against intracellular amastigotes, which are the reproductive forms in the vertebrate host and are thus an important determinant in the selection and identification of effective compounds for further in vivo analysis. In addition, due to pharmacokinetics and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics, several compounds that were promising in vitro have not been as effective as Nf or Bz in animal models of T. cruzi infection. In the last two decades, our team has collaborated with different medicinal chemistry groups to develop preclinical studies for CD and investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy, toxicity, selectivity, and parasite targets of different classes of natural and synthetic compounds. Some of these results will be briefly presented, focusing primarily on diamidines and related compounds and naphthoquinone derivatives that showed the most promising efficacy against T. cruzi.",,,,2011-11-18,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Baseline characteristics from a randomized clinical trial of treatment-naive subjects conducted at sites in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and North and South America were analysed to determine if there were significant differences by sex.
Of the 1,571 participants, 740 (47.1%) were women.

The sex difference in viral load was related to CD4(+) T-cell count; however, it was independent of country and persisted within the strata with CD4(+) T-cell count <200 cells/mm³.
Women in resource-limited settings have lower levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA and appear to present for enrolment into clinical trials at an earlier stage of disease than men.

Research at several biotechnology companies, sponsored by product development partners (PDPs), has been successful in identifying a novel class of boron-based drugs, the benzoxaboroles, as potential treatments for neglected tropical diseases. This work was based, in part, on the earlier observation of antifungal, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of the benzoxaboroles. The unique properties of boron, namely its ability to reversibly interact with biochemical targets through an empty p-orbital, are important to the success of these new drug candidates.

21824073,A decade of targets and patented drugs for chemotherapy of Chagas disease.,,Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery,"Chagas disease, a parasitic infection typically spread by triatomine bugs, affects millions of people throughout Latin America. Current chemotherapy based on the nitroaromatic compounds, benzonidazole and nifurtimox provides unsatisfactory results and suffers from considerable side effects. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for new drugs to treat this neglected disease. During the last decade, the advances and understanding in the biology and biochemistry of Trypanosoma cruzi have allowed the identification of multiple new targets for Chagas' disease chemotherapy. Among the most promising targets for antiparasitic drugs are: cruzipain, the main cysteine protease of T. cruzi, essential for parasite survival and proliferation in mammalian host; ergosterol biosynthesis pathway; trypanothione synthesis and thiol-dependant redox metabolism. Specific enzymes of the glycolytic, pentose phosphate, polyisoprenoid (farnesylpyrophosphate synthase) and other particular biosynthetic pathways as well as enzymes from purine salvage (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase, dihydrofolate reductase) have also been intensively studied in T. cruzi. In particular, trypanocidal agents that target the validated biochemical pathways of the parasite including cysteine proteinase inhibitors and inhibitors capable to block ergosterol biosynthesis are currently in the pipeline. Among the latter, posaconazole and ravuconazole, are planned to enter in clinical trials for trypanocidal chemotherapy in the near future. This review will summarize advances on antichagasic agents directed to specific parasite targets such as metabolic pathways or specific enzymes.

The tools of drug discovery have improved dramatically in the interim; however, this has not translated into new drugs for Chagas disease. This has been largely because the main practitioners of drug discovery are pharmaceutical companies who are not financially motivated to invest in Chagas disease and other ""orphan"" diseases. As a result, it has largely been up to academic groups to bring drug candidates through the discovery pipeline and to clinical trials. The difficulty with drug discovery in academia has been the challenge of bringing together the diverse expertise in biology, chemistry, and pharmacology in concerted efforts towards a common goal of developing therapeutics. Funding is often inadequate, but lack of coordination amongst academic investigators with different expertise has also contributed to the slow progress. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of approaches that can be accomplished in academic settings for preclinical drug discovery for Chagas disease.

Symptoms are usually mild with severe acute disease occurring in less than 1% of patients. Orally transmitted Trypanosoma cruzi outbreaks can have more severe acute morbidity and higher mortality than vector-borne infection. Congenital T. cruzi infection occurs in 1-10% of infants of infected mothers. Most congenital infections are asymptomatic or cause non-specific signs, requiring laboratory screening for detection. A small proportion of congenital infections cause severe morbidity with hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, meningoencephalitis and/or respiratory insufficiency, with an associated high mortality. Infected infants are presumed to carry the same 20-30% lifetime risk of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease as other infected individuals. Most control programs in Latin America employ prenatal serological screening followed by microscopic examination of cord blood from infants of seropositive mothers. Recent data confirm that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is more sensitive and detects congenital infections earlier than conventional techniques. For infants not diagnosed at birth, conventional serology is recommended at at 6 to 9 months of age. In programs that have been evaluated, less than 20% of at risk infants completed all steps of the screening algorithm.

21503415,Cell therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy: from animal models to clinical trials.,,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,"Dilated cardiomyopathy can be the end-stage form and common denominator of several cardiac disorders of known cause, such as hypertensive, ischemic, diabetic and Chagasic diseases. However, some individuals have clinical findings, such as an increase in ventricular chamber size and impaired contractility (classical manifestations of dilated cardiomyopathy) even in the absence of a diagnosed primary disease. In these patients, dilated cardiomyopathy is classified as idiopathic since its etiology is obscure. Nevertheless, regardless of all of the advances in medical, pharmacological and surgical procedures, the fate of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (of idiopathic or of any other known cause) is linked to arrhythmic episodes, severe congestive heart failure and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. In this review, we will summarize present data on the use of cell therapies in animal models of dilated cardiomyopathies and will discuss the few clinical trials that have been published so far involving patients affected by this disease. The animal models discussed here include those in which the cardiomyopathy is produced by genetic manipulation and those in which disease is induced by chemical or infectious agents. The specific model used clearly creates restrictions to translation of the proposed cell therapy to clinical practice, insofar as most of the clinical trials performed to date with cell therapy have used autologous cells. Thus, translation of genetic models of dilated cardiomyopathy may have to wait until the use of allogeneic cells becomes more widespread in clinical trials of cell therapies for cardiac diseases.",,,,2011-04-20,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This randomized, controlled, single-blind trial included 40 patients with ChC (age 49.5 +/- 7.8 years, 57.5% male) who did not practice regular exercise. All patients were assessed, at baseline and at the end of the study, by exercise test (VO(2) and exercise time), six-minute walk test (6MWT), Goldman Specific Activity Scale (SAS), HQoL, and BNP levels. Patients were randomized to inactive control group (ICG = 19) or exercise training group (ETG = 21). Exercise training group patients underwent 12 weeks of exercise training: walking for up to 30 min (intensity 50-70% HR reserve + HR at rest) and warm-up and cooling-down exercising, three times a week. The data were analysed for delta values (Delta= end - baseline). After intervention, compared with the ICG, the ETG had significant increases in functional parameters including, DeltaVO(2) (6.5 vs. 2.8 mL/kg/min, P = 0.001), Delta exercise time (2.9 vs.1.1 min, P < 0.001), Delta6MWT distance (83.5 vs. 2.0 m, P = 0.001) improved DeltaSAS (8 vs. 1 patient, P = 0.008), and HQoL: Delta domains vitality (7.5 vs. 0 points, P = 0.013), Delta emotional aspects (16.7 vs. 0 points, P = 0.012), and Delta mental health (16.1 vs. 0 points, P = 0.031).

Crystal structures of the drug target enzyme, Trypanosoma cruzi sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51), complexed with posaconazole, another antifungal agent fluconazole and an experimental inhibitor, (R)-4'-chloro-N-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imid-azol-1-yl)ethyl)biphenyl-4-carboxamide (VNF), allow prediction of important chemical features that enhance the drug potencies. Combined with comparative analysis of inhibitor binding parameters, influence on the catalytic activity of the trypanosomal enzyme and its human counterpart, and their cellular effects at different stages of the Trypanosoma cruzi life cycle, the structural data provide a molecular background to CYP51 inhibition and azole resistance and enlighten the path for directed design of new, more potent and selective drugs to develop an efficient treatment for Chagas disease.",,,,2010-06-10,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Although the occurrence of acute cases sharply has declined due to Southern Cone Initiative efforts to control vector transmission, there still remain serious challenges, including the maintenance of sustainable public policies for Chagas disease control and the urgent need for better drugs to treat chagasic patients. Since the introduction of benznidazole and nifurtimox approximately 40 years ago, many natural and synthetic compounds have been assayed against Trypanosoma cruzi, yet only a few compounds have advanced to clinical trials. This reflects, at least in part, the lack of consensus regarding appropriate in vitro and in vivo screening protocols as well as the lack of biomarkers for treating parasitaemia. The development of more effective drugs requires (i) the identification and validation of parasite targets, (ii) compounds to be screened against the targets or the whole parasite and (iii) a panel of minimum standardised procedures to advance leading compounds to clinical trials. This third aim was the topic of the workshop entitled Experimental Models in Drug Screening and Development for Chagas Disease, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the 25th and 26th of November 2008 by the Fiocruz Program for Research and Technological Development on Chagas Disease and Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.

Scintigraphic images revealed an uptake of 5.4%±1.7, 4.3%±1.5 and 2.3%±0.6 of the total infused radioactivity in the heart after 1, 3 and 24h, respectively. The remaining activity was distributed mainly to the liver and spleen. Of 102 segments analyzed, homing took place in 36%.

We studied the influence of beta-blockers in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy.
We examined REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas versus non-Chagas) and beta-blocker therapy. Primary end point was all-cause mortality or heart transplantation. Altogether 456 patients were studied; 27 (5.9%) were submitted to heart transplantation and 202 (44.3%) died. Chagas etiology was present in 68 (14.9%) patients; they had lower body mass index (24.1+/-4.1 versus 26.3+/-5.1, P=0.001), smaller end-diastolic left ventricle diameter (6.7+/-1.0 mm versus 7.0+/-0.9 mm, P=0.001), smaller proportion of beta-blocker therapy (35.8% versus 68%, P<0.001), and higher proportion of spironolactone therapy (74.6% versus 57.8%, P=0.003). Twenty-four (35.8%) patients with Chagas disease were under beta-blocker therapy and had lower serum sodium (136.6+/-3.1 versus 138.4+/-3.1 mEqs, P=0.05) and lower body mass index (22.5+/-3.3 versus 24.9+/-4.3, P=0.03) compared with those who received beta-blockers. Survival was lower in patients with Chagas heart disease as compared with other etiologies. When only patients under beta-blockers were considered, the survival of patients with Chagas disease was similar to that of other etiologies. The survival of patients with beta-blockers was higher than that of patients without beta-blockers. In Cox regression model, left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (hazard ratio, 1.78; CI, 1.15 to 2.76; P=0.009) and beta-blockers (hazard ratio, 0.37; CI, 0.14 to 0.97; P=0.044) were associated with better survival.

In recent years, the use of stem/progenitor cell transplantation in animal models of HIE has also been evaluated in several laboratories. It was shown that human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells may have a therapeutic potential through multiple mechanisms acting locally in the central nervous system and possibly in peripheral organs of hypoxic-ischemic animals. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) have also been transplanted in animal models of HIE, migrating long distances to ischemic brain areas and differentiating into neurons. The results of these studies have raised important questions that must be addressed before these findings can be translated to the bedside.

The major limitation in developing and evaluating potential new drugs for their efficacy is the lack of reliable tests to assess parasite burden and elimination.
Adults volunteers with chronic T. cruzi infection were evaluated clinically and stratified according to the Kuschnir classification. Individuals with group 0 and group 1 clinical status were treated with benznidazole (5 mg/kg per day for 30 days). The changes in T. cruzi-specific T cell and antibody responses, as well as in clinical status, were measured periodically over the 3-5-year follow-up period and were compared with pretreatment conditions and with values in an untreated control group.
The frequency of peripheral interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing T cells specific for T. cruzi declined as early as 12 months after benznidazole treatment and subsequently became undetectable in a substantial proportion of treated subjects. In addition, decreases in antibody responses to a pool of recombinant T. cruzi proteins also decreased in many of these same subjects. The shift to negative IFN-gamma T cell responses was highly associated with an early increase in IFN-gamma-producing T cells with phenotypic features of effector/effector memory cells in a subset of subjects. Benznidazole treatment also resulted in an increase in naive and early differentiated memory-like CD8(+) T cells in a majority of subjects.

Our objectives were to evaluate published evidence on the treatment of chronic Chagas' disease with benznidazole and on the potential benefits of this drug in the chronic phase of the disease.
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by means of an electronic search of the published literature, with no language restrictions, until October 2008. We included studies on chronically infected patients of any age who were in the indeterminate phase or had visceral involvement and for whom treatment with benznidazole was compared with placebo or no treatment. The primary endpoint was response to therapy (whether serological, parasitological or clinical), as it was measured in each of the studies included. Clinical response to therapy was also analysed.
We identified 696 studies, from which we chose 9: 3 clinical trials and 6 observational studies. Compared with placebo or no treatment, benznidazole increases 18-fold the probability of a response to therapy [global odds ratio (OR), 18.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.2-68.3]. This effect was mainly observed in clinical trials (OR, 70.8; 95% CI, 16-314), whereas in observational studies it was much less marked (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 2.1-28.9), and even less so when only observational studies in adults were considered (OR, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.6-24.7).

These compounds are currently the most advanced candidates for new anti-T. cruzi agents given that they block de novo production of 24-alkyl-sterols, which are essential for parasite survival and cannot be replaced by a host's own cholesterol. Among these compounds, new triazole derivatives that inhibit the parasite's C14alpha sterol demethylase are the most promising, as they have been shown to have curative activity in murine models of acute and chronic Chagas disease and are active against NFX and BZN-resistant T. cruzi strains; among this class of compounds, posaconazole (Schering-Plough Research Institute) and ravuconazole (Eisai Company) are poised for clinical trials in Chagas disease patients in the short term. Other T. cruzi-specific EBI, with in vitro and in vivo potency, include squalene synthase, lanosterol synthase and squalene epoxidase-inhibitors as well as compounds with dual mechanisms of action (ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition and free radical generation), but they are less advanced in their development process. The main putative advantages of EBI over currently available therapies include their higher potency and selectivity in both acute and chronic infections, activity against NFX and BZN-resistant T. cruzi strains, and much better tolerability and safety profiles. Limitations may include complexity and cost of manufacture of the new compounds. As for any new drug, such compounds will require extensive clinical testing before being introduced for clinical use, and the complexity of such studies, particularly in chronic patients, will be compounded by the current limitations in the verification of true parasitological cures for T. cruzi infections.",,,,2009-09-24,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

This not only boosts the action of the different compounds, but also may avoid the development of parasite resistance .To this end, over the short term, we propose experimental studies on laboratory animals and clinical trials with the following associations: (i) nifurtimox (8 mg/kg/day) + benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day) x 60 consecutive days; (ii) nifurtimox (8 mg/kg/day) or benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day) + allopurinol (8-10 mg/kg/day) x 60 days and (iii) nifurtimox (8 mg/kg/day) or benznidazole (5 mg/kg/day) + ketoconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole (5-6 mg/kg/day) x 60 consecutive days. The doses of the drugs and the treatment schedules for the clinical trials must be adapted according to the side effects. From these, other double or triple associations could be made, using drugs with different mechanisms of action. This proposal does not exclude investigations on new drugs over the median and long terms, targeting other aspects of the metabolism of Trypanosoma cruzi. Until such time as the ideal drug for specific treatment of Chagas disease might be discovered, we need to develop new strategies for achieving greater efficacy with the old drugs in associations and to develop rational experimentation with new drugs.",,,,2009-09-02,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
19673669,Cellular cardiac regenerative therapy in which patients?,,Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,"Cell-based myocardial regenerative therapy is undergoing experimental and clinical trials in order to limit the consequences of decreased contractile function and compliance of damaged ventricles owing to ischemic and nonischemic myocardial diseases. A variety of myogenic and angiogenic cell types have been proposed, such as skeletal myoblasts, mononuclear and mesenchymal bone marrow cells, circulating blood-derived progenitors, adipose-derived stromal cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, umbilical cord cells, endometrial mesenchymal stem cells, adult testis pluripotent stem cells and embryonic cells. Current indications for stem cell therapy concern patients who have had a left- or right-ventricular infarction or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies. Other indications and potential applications include patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy, Chagas heart disease (American trypanosomiasis), ischemic mitral regurgitation, left ventricular noncompacted myocardium and pediatric cardiomyopathy. Suitable sources of cells for cardiac implant will depend on the types of diseases to be treated. For acute myocardial infarction, a cell that reduces myocardial necrosis and augments vascular blood flow will be desirable. For heart failure, cells that replace or promote myogenesis, reverse apoptopic mechanisms and reactivate dormant cell processes will be useful. It is important to note that stem cells are not an alternative to heart transplantation; selected patients should be in an early stage of heart failure as the goal of this regenerative approach is to avoid or delay organ transplantation. Since the cell niche provides crucial support needed for stem cell maintenance, the most interesting and realistic perspectives include the association of intramyocardial cell transplantation with tissue-engineered scaffolds and multisite cardiac pacing in order to transform a passive regenerative approach into a 'dynamic cellular support', a promising method for the creation of 'bioartificial myocardium'.",,,,2009-08-14,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Currently, half the world’s population is estimated to be at risk of contracting these vector-borne diseases, and almost one million people die annually from these diseases. No effective vaccine exists to treat these infectious diseases and available treatments are far from ideal. Coordination metal complexes offer potential in the development of new antiparasitic drugs. Indeed, coordination compounds in medicine are a growing and exciting research field, having been used successfully in cancer therapy. As an antiparasitic agent, ferroquine has entered phase II clinical trials against malaria and is an excellent example to encourage the development of antiparasitic metal-based drugs.

A literature survey was conducted using Medline for CRCTs of interventions aimed at managing any one of the six major tropical parasitic diseases: malaria, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Information was extracted from the published articles in order that, for each trial, categorical responses could be made to a pre-specified list of 12 questions concerning issues relating to the methodological quality of the trial, including choice of design, generalisability, baseline assessment, blinding, use or non-use of a matched design, and accounting for the intraclass correlation in both design and analysis. The literature survey found 38 CRCTs. Of the 35 CRCTs that reported at least one human outcome, 27 were for interventions in the management of malaria whilst the rest were for managing leishmaniasis (4 trials), lymphatic filariasis (2 trials) and schistosomiasis (2 trials).

18977804,"Cardiomyopathy, adult valve disease and heart failure in South America.",,Heart (British Cardiac Society),"Continued assessment of temporal trends in mortality and epidemiology of specific cardiovascular diseases in South America is needed to provide a scientific basis for rational allocation of the limited healthcare resources and introduction of strategies to reduce risk and predict the future burden of cardiovascular disease. The epidemiology of cardiomyopathies, adult valve disease and heart failure (HF) in South America is reviewed here. Diseases of the circulatory system are the main cause of death based on data from about 50% of the South American population. Among the cardiovascular causes of death, cerebrovascular disease is predominant followed by ischaemic heart disease, other heart diseases and hypertensive disease. Of note, cerebrovascular disease is the main cause of death in women, and race also influenced cardiovascular mortality rates. HF is the most important cardiovascular reason for admission to hospital due to cardiovascular disease of ischaemic, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic, valvular, hypertensive and chagasic aetiologies. Also, mortality due to HF is high, especially owing to Chagas' disease. HF and aetiologies associated with HF are responsible for 6.3% of deaths. Rheumatic fever is the leading cause of valvular heart disease. The findings have important public health implications because the allocation of healthcare resources, and strategies to reduce the risk of HF should also consider controlling Chagas' disease and rheumatic fever in South American countries.",,,,2008-11-04,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
18930565,Primaquine revisited six decades after its discovery.,,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Primaquine was firstly synthesized in 1946 in the USA, and is the most representative member of the anti-malarial 8-aminoquinolines. Six decades have passed and primaquine is still the only transmission-blocking anti-malarial clinically available, displaying a marked activity against gametocytes of all species of human malaria, including multi-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Primaquine is also effective against all exoerythrocytic forms of the parasite and is used in conjunction with other anti-malarials for the treatment of vivax and ovale malaria. However, primaquine is often associated with serious adverse effects, in consequence of its toxic metabolites. 5-Hydroxyprimaquine or 6-methoxy-8-aminoquinoline has been considered to be directly responsible for complications such as hemolytic anemia. Primaquine toxicity is aggravated in people deficient of 6-glucose phosphate dehydrogenase or glutathione synthetase. Adverse effects are further amplified by the fact that primaquine must be repeatedly administered at high doses, due to its limited oral bioavailability. Over the last two decades, Medicinal Chemists have battled against primaquine's disadvantages, while keeping or even improving its unequalled performance as an anti-malarial. The present text revisits primaquine and its properties on the occasion of its 60th anniversary and aims to give a general overview of what has been the path towards the development of effective and safe primaquine-based anti-malarials. Presently, aablaquine and tafenoquine the two most promising primaquine analogues are already in the final stages of clinical trials against Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum.

To evaluate and compare the hemodynamic effects of the use of local anesthetics with a non-adrenergic vasoconstrictor in patients with ventricular arrhythmia, when compared to the use of anesthetics without vasoconstrictor.
A prospective randomized study evaluated 33 patients with positive serology for Chagas' disease and 32 patients with coronary artery disease that presented complex ventricular arrhythmia at Holter monitoring (>10 EV/h and NSVT), of which 21 were females, aged 54.73 + 7.94 years, submitted to routine dental treatment with pterygomandibular anesthesia. These patients were divided in two groups: group I received prilocaine 3% associated with felypressin 0.03 IU/ml and group II received lidocaine 2% without vasoconstrictor. The number and complexity of extrasystoles were analyzed, as well as the heart rate and systemic arterial pressure of the patients on the day before, one hour before, during the procedure and one hour after the dental procedure.
No hemodynamic alterations or increase in the number and complexity of the ventricular arrhythmia related to the anesthetic used in the dental procedure were observed in either group.

18844669,Caged protein prenyltransferase substrates: tools for understanding protein prenylation.,,Chemical biology & drug design,"Originally designed to block the prenylation of oncogenic Ras, inhibitors of protein farnesyltransferase currently in preclinical and clinical trials are showing efficacy in cancers with normal Ras. Blocking protein prenylation has also shown promise in the treatment of malaria, Chagas disease and progeria syndrome. A better understanding of the mechanism, targets and in vivo consequences of protein prenylation are needed to elucidate the mode of action of current PFTase (Protein Farnesyltransferase) inhibitors and to create more potent and selective compounds. Caged enzyme substrates are useful tools for understanding enzyme mechanism and biological function. Reported here is the synthesis and characterization of caged substrates of PFTase. The caged isoprenoid diphosphates are poor substrates prior to photolysis. The caged CAAX peptide is a true catalytically caged substrate of PFTase in that it is to not a substrate, yet is able to bind to the enzyme as established by inhibition studies and X-ray crystallography. Irradiation of the caged molecules with 350 nm light readily releases their cognate substrate and their photolysis products are benign.

However, for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), Chagas disease and cutaneous leishmaniases there has been limited progress. For HAT, a novel diamidine, parfuramidine, is in phase III clinical trial for early-stage disease, but for the treatment of late-stage disease there are no new drugs and combinations of eflornithine with melarsoprol or nifurtimox have been the focus of clinical studies. For Chagas disease, different classes of compounds that have validated biochemical targets, sterol biosynthesis methylases and cysteine proteases, are in various stages of development. The genome sequences that are now available for the pathogens that cause the leishmaniases and trypanosomiases, and new methods for rapid validation of targets, are part of the solution to discover new drugs.

Recent data indicate that parasite persistence plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas' cardiomyopathy. However, the efficacy of trypanocidal therapy in preventing clinical complications in patients with preexisting cardiac disease is unknown.
BENEFIT is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 3,000 patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy in Latin America. Patients are randomized to receive benznidazole (5 mg/kg per day) or matched placebo, for 60 days. The primary outcome is the composite of death; resuscitated cardiac arrest; sustained ventricular tachycardia; insertion of pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator; cardiac transplantation; and development of new heart failure, stroke, or systemic or pulmonary thromboembolic events. The average follow-up time will be 5 years, and the trial has a 90% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction. The BENEFIT program also comprises a substudy evaluating the effects of benznidazole on parasite clearance and an echo substudy exploring the impact of etiologic treatment on left ventricular function. Recruitment started in November 2004, and >1,000 patients have been enrolled in 35 centers from Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia to date.

There are many reasons for the absence of specific therapeutic studies, including difficulty in enrolling patients, inadequate measurement tools to evaluate neurologic improvement, and even lack of interest. Oral or intravenous corticosteroids are now the mainstay of HAM/TSP treatment, especially in the initial phase of the disease, when inflammation is more prominent than demyelination. Motor disability, pain, and urinary dysfunction may be ameliorated, but improvement is not sustained in many patients. Valproic acid has emerged as a potential treatment for HAM/TSP; recent evidence shows that this drug can activate viral gene expression and expose virus-infected cells to the immune system, leading to a reduction of the proviral load.

18367671,A mechanism for cross-resistance to nifurtimox and benznidazole in trypanosomes.,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Nifurtimox and benznidazole are the front-line drugs used to treat Chagas disease, the most important parasitic infection in the Americas. These agents function as prodrugs and must be activated within the parasite to have trypanocidal effects. Despite >40 years of research, the mechanism(s) of action and resistance have remained elusive. Here, we report that in trypanosomes, both drugs are activated by a NADH-dependent, mitochondrially localized, bacterial-like, type I nitroreductase (NTR), and that down-regulation of this explains how resistance may emerge. Loss of a single copy of this gene in Trypanosoma cruzi, either through in vitro drug selection or by targeted gene deletion, is sufficient to cause significant cross-resistance to a wide range of nitroheterocyclic drugs. In Trypanosoma brucei, loss of a single NTR allele confers similar cross-resistance without affecting growth rate or the ability to establish an infection. This potential for drug resistance by a simple mechanism has important implications, because nifurtimox is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials against African trypanosomiasis.",,,,2008-03-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

It is quite difficult to test, isolate, and elucidate the structure and mechanism of compounds from the plethora of new medicinal plant uses described each year with limited laboratory time and resources and the high cost of clinical trials of new drug candidates.
A new quantitative theoretical framework of mathematical formulas called ""relational efficacy"" is proposed that should narrow down this search for new plant-derived medicines based on the hypothesis that closely related plants used to treat closely related diseases in distantly related cultures have a higher probability of being effective because they are more likely to be independent discoveries of similar plant compounds and disease mechanisms. A prerequisite to this hypothesis, the idea that empirical testing in traditional medicine will lead to choosing similar medicinal plants and therefore the medicinal flora of two distant cultures will prove to be more similar than their general flora, is tested using resampling statistics on cross-cultural field data of the plants used by the Malinké of Mali and the Asháninka of Peru to treat the diseases malaria, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, diabetes, eczema, asthma, and uterine fibroids.
In this case, the similarity of the medicinal floras is found to be significantly greater than the similarity of the general floras, but only when the diseases in question are grouped into the categories of parasitic and autoimmune diseases.

17383291,A randomized trial of carvedilol after renin-angiotensin system inhibition in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.,,American heart journal,"The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors and beta-blockers in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.
Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy causes substantial morbidity and mortality in Latin America. Whether RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers are safe and beneficial has been challenged because of the lack of formal trials.
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trial in 42 patients with Trypanosoma cruzi infection and cardiomyopathy. All patients received enalapril (up-titrated to 20 mg BID) and spironolactone (25 mg QD). Subsequently, the patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 20) or carvedilol up-titrated to 25 mg BID (n = 19). The primary end points were change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after RAS inhibition and that after the addition of carvedilol. The secondary end points were changes in other echocardiographic parameters, Framingham score, quality of life (36-item Short-Form Health Survey), New York Heart Association class, radiographic indices, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and chemokines as well as safety end points.
Optimization of RAS inhibition was safe, hemodynamically well tolerated, and associated with improvements in Framingham score (P = .001) and quality of life as well as reductions in the cardiothoracic index (P = .002), brain natriuretic peptide level (P = .032), and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted) level (P = .001). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased by 2.3% (P = .25); in patients with an LVEF < or = 45% at baseline, it increased by 2.8% (P = .017). Treatment with carvedilol was associated with a trend toward an increase in LVEF (absolute difference between groups, 2.3%; P = .094). The addition of carvedilol was safe, hemodynamically well tolerated, and not associated with symptomatic bradycardia.

At first, we observed that the ex vivo cytokine profile of circulating leukocytes from E-IND (n = 6) resembled the one observed for healthy schoolchildren (n = 7). Additionally, in vitro stimulation with T. cruzi antigens drove the E-IND cytokine pattern toward a mixed immune profile with higher levels of IFN-gamma+, TNF-alpha+ and IL-4+ NK cells, increased numbers of IFN-gamma+, TNF-alpha+ and IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in addition to enhanced frequency of TNF-alpha+/IL-4+ CD19+ lymphocytes. Interestingly, upon T. cruzi antigen in vitro stimulation, E-IND CD8+ lymphocytes displayed a selective enhancement of IFN-gamma expression, accounting for a global type 1-modulated cytokine microenvironment. A shift toward a type 1-modulated profile was also the hallmark of Bz-treated children (E-IND(T)). In this context, despite the mixed overall ex vivo cytokine profile observed for NK and CD8+ T cells, increased ability of these leukocytes to produce IFN-gamma in response to T. cruzi antigens was reported. Most noteworthy was the IL-10 production evidenced at T lymphocytes, mainly CD4+ cells, as well as B lymphocytes, both ex vivo and upon antigen stimulation. Together, these findings gave evidence that NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes are the major sources of IFN-gamma, a pivotal cytokine for successful therapeutic response in human Chagas' disease. Moreover, our data have also brought additional information, pointing out IL-10 production by CD4+ cells and B lymphocytes, as the putative key element for parasite clearance in the absence of deleterious tissue damage.",,,,2006-10-13,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
17002630,Evaluation of a prototype Trypanosoma cruzi antibody assay with recombinant antigens on a fully automated chemiluminescence analyzer for blood donor screening.,,Transfusion,"Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite that can be transmitted by transfusion. The diagnosis of chronic T. cruzi infection is generally made by detecting specific antibodies that bind to parasite antigens. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a new serologic assay for antibodies to T. cruzi on a fully automated analyzer (PRISM, Abbott Laboratories).
A prototype chemiluminescent immunoassay based on chimeric recombinant antigens and run on the automated PRISM system was developed for detecting antibodies to T. cruzi in human serum and plasma. Assay specificity was evaluated by testing samples from random blood donors and from a diverse group of specimens from persons with diseases or conditions often associated with false-positive reactions in T. cruzi assays. Sensitivity was determined by testing 377 geographically diverse T. cruzi antibody-positive specimens.
Six of 7911 samples (0.08%) from random donors were repeatedly reactive in the prototype PRISM Chagas assay. One of these was reactive in three other tests, including the radioimmune precipitation assay and was presumed to be a true positive. Hence, the specificity was 99.94 percent (7905/7910) in the negative donor group studied. All 377 T. cruzi antibody-positive specimens were positive in the prototype assay and thus the sensitivity was 100 percent.

One hypothesis which may explain this unexpected finding is that some individuals donate blood because they are seeking HIV testing. The objective of this study was to characterize test-seeking blood donors and to determine whether they are at higher risk for HIV infection compared with other donors.
Subjects presenting for blood donation were asked to participate in a study assessing their motivations (including test seeking) to donate, as measured by perceiving donation as a means to obtain infectious disease test results. Participants completed the standard blood bank predonation screening questions plus our additional survey, and were tested for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell lymphocytotrophic virus (HTLV) I/II, syphilis and Chagas' disease. As a result of anticipated low statistical power to directly measure the association between test-seeking motivation and HIV infection, we tested for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) as a marker of sexual risk for HIV. Our survey includes accepted donors as well as persons whose risk-behaviour histories would result in their exclusion from donation according to routine screening procedures.
Of 1,720 potential blood donors randomly selected and approached, 1,600 (93.0%) participated. Overall, 141 (8.8%) were classified as test seekers; 15.6% of these were HSV-2 positive. The proportion of test seekers was the same among community-recruited and replacement donors. Test seekers had a higher prevalence of HSV-2 [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.59] adjusting for age, gender and prior donation. The association was significant among community-recruited blood donors whose previous donation was more than 1 year ago (i.e. 'lapsed donors') (AOR 2.55; 95% CI: 1.20-5.44). Test seekers were not more likely to be rejected from blood donation as a result of health reasons, self-reported HIV risk-related behaviour, or by their own confidential unit exclusion. We found no difference in HSV-2 prevalence between persons accepted for donation (15.7%) and those rejected because of self-reported sexual risk (16.7%).
We did not detect a difference in the proportion of test seekers across different types of blood donors; however, we did detect an association between HSV-2 infection and test seeking, especially among community-recruited lapsed blood donors. Of note, questions on test-seeking behaviour detected donors with increased prevalence of HSV-2, but the self-reported sexual risk behaviours currently used for deferral criteria did not.

16255752,A Latin American registry of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: the ICD-LABOR study.,,"Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc","Despite the progress that has been reached in emergency medical systems and resuscitation, sudden cardiac death (SCD) continues to be the major cause of the death, and remains a significant public health problem. In this publication we are reporting our Latin American experience in the secondary prevention of SCD, by means of an ongoing registry involving seven Latin American countries and 770 patients.
Every individual within the present registry to date has presented with antecedents of aborted sudden death or cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Patients included have fulfilled the Class I indication for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and they were implanted with a Biotronik ICD (all models). The study was not sponsored by Biotronik, nor did they have access to the data. A specific protocol was designed for implantation and follow-up of patients. The database was completely registered through the Internet and a personal password was assigned to each group of investigators. The primary end point was death from all causes. Secondary end points were SCD and death due to congestive heart failure (CHF).
The etiology of cardiac disease was found to be predominantly coronary artery disease (CAD) 39.7% (306 patients), followed by Chagas disease (ChD), 26.1% (201 patients), and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 17% (131 patients). Any remaining pathologies were included as miscellaneous 13.2% (101 patients). In 31 patients (4%) the etiology was unknown. The age did not differ within the principal pathologies, but was significantly older than the miscellaneous group (62.0 +/- 11.3 years vs 48.2 +/- 18.9 years, P < 0.0001). The follow-up period was 27 +/- 25 months (1-113 months) for the whole group. The mortality in functional classes I-II was significantly lower than mortality for functional classes III-IV (relative risk 1.46, CI 95%, P < 0.0001). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) for the whole group was 37.7 +/- 14.3%. Male LVEF was 36.1 +/- 14.1% and female LVEF was 42.2 +/- 13.8% P < 0.0001. During the follow-up period, 130 deaths were reported (global mortality 16.9 +/- 9.7%), out of which 84 (64.6%) were attributed to cardiac causes (10.9 +/- 5.1% of the total population). The annual adjusted cardiac mortality was 5.2 +/- 1.72% (range 3.5-7.0%). Among cardiac deaths the most common cause was progressive heart failure, 48 patients (57%) including 3 patients with pulmonary embolism. The second main cause of cardiac death was SCD, 36 patients (43%), including 4 patients with electrical storm and 3 patients with electromechanical dissociation after multiple shock therapy treatments.
Despite the differences in terms of pathologies between the ICD-LABOR (Latin American bioelectronic ongoing registry) and randomized ICD trials, a parallel evolution in all cause mortality and cardiac mortality was observed.

16235350,"Trypanocidal drugs for late stage, symptomatic Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi infection).",,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"People with Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis) may develop progressive and potentially lethal heart conditions. Drugs to eliminate the causative parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, currently in use have limited therapeutic value and are used in early stages of the disease. Extending the use of these drugs to treat symptomatic chronic parasitism with chronic Chagasic cardiopathy (CCC) and progressive dilated cardiomyopathy has been proposed.
To assess the effects (harms and benefits) of nitrofurans and imidazolic trypanocidal drugs for treating late stage chronic Chagas disease and CCC.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2004), MEDLINE (1985-2004), EMBASE (1985-2004), BIREME (1985-2004), LILACS (1985-2004), ARTEMISA (1985-2004), SCIELO (1985-2004). Indexing terms in English and Spanish were used. References obtained were assessed for relevance by two reviewers independently.
We included randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), single or double blind using trypanocidal drugs versus placebo or no treatment in CCC.
All articles retrieved were assessed using a predefined check list to determine if they met the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers collected data using a pre-designed form piloted on three articles before the review process started. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. If the information was unavailable the articles were excluded. We planned a quantitative analysis of reduction of parasite load whether recorded as a categorical variable or the reduction of specific antibody titers. However insufficient data were available for quantitative analysis. We prepared a qualitative description of data identified.
We found only one randomized double blind placebo controlled trial. We also found six uncontrolled or non-randomized studies which were of some relevance and were therefore described. We found insufficient evidence to define the effects of drug treatment for people with CCC.
There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of nitrofurans or imidazolic drugs as recommended treatment in CCC and chronic T.cruzi infections, specifically if overt heart disease is present. A well designed randomized controlled trial is necessary to establish if new drugs are suitable for treatment of cardiac patients with CCC.",,,,2005-10-20,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The situation for the two trypanosomiases has been less encouraging. Apart from the introduction of eflornithine for the treatment of late-stage human African trypanosomiasis, with its serious limitations in terms of cost and difficulty of administration, no new drugs have been incorporated into the chemotherapeutic arsenal in the past 25 years, despite important advances in knowledge of the biology of the etiological agents and the pathophysiology of these diseases. In the case of Chagas disease, several classes of compound that target the validated biochemical pathways of the parasite (e.g. inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis and cysteine proteases) are in the pipeline. With the availability of complete genome sequences for all three pathogens, and methods for rapid validation of targets, it is hoped that much-needed amelioration will occur soon.

The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of this vaccine were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial conducted in Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. Healthy infants were given two doses of vaccine (104.7, 105.2 or 105.8 ffu) or placebo at age 2 and 4 months, with routine DTPw-HBV and Hib vaccines. OPV was given separately, at least 2 weeks before or after administration of the study vaccine. A total of 2155 infants were enrolled, of whom 1618 received one of the three vaccine viral concentrations and 537 were given placebo. Analysis of efficacy included diarrheal episodes occurring from 2 weeks after second dose until one year of age. Efficacy rates against any rotavirus gastroenteritis, severe rotavirus gastroenteritis and hospitalizations for rotavirus disease were as high as 70% (46-84%; 95%CI), 86% (63-96%; 95%CI), and 93% (54-100%; 95%CI), respectively. For non-G1 (mainly G9) serotypes, RIX4414 vaccine conferred protection as high as 83% (40-97%; 95%CI) against severe gastroenteritis. A decrease was noted in the incidence of severe rotavirus-related gastroenteritis after first dose.

One-hundred-and-thirty-nine (92%) patients presented with active lesions and were treated with daily doses of meglumine antimoniate: 81 adults received a 5-ml vial IM and 58 children received 1 to 5 ml. Forty-five (32.4%) patients underwent continuous treatment with meglumine antimoniate for 25 to 116 days without rest intervals, and 94 (67.6%) intermittent treatment with 2 to 5 series of meglumine antimoniate. Intermittent series could include schedules of daily IM applications for 10 to 25 days each and intervals varying from 10 to 60 days.

A systematic random sample of 400 was taken from 1200 banked serum samples of donors screened between August 1998 and January 1999 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Samples were tested with indirect hemagglutination test (IHA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Sensitivity and specificity of tests were estimated through latent class analysis.
The sensitivity of individual tests ranged from 96.5 to 100 percent, and their specificity from 87.0 to 98.9 percent. Combinations of two tests used in parallel would, even at 40 percent prevalence, only miss approximately 1 infected unit per 10,000 screened. At 5 percent prevalence, however, they would yield 75 to 120 false-positive units per 1000 units screened. Parallel testing with IHA plus ELISA or with IHA plus IFA is marginally more cost-effective, compared to single IHA testing, than single ELISA or single IFA testing, regardless of the T. cruzi prevalence.

15785826,Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome.,,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,"Improving the course and outcome of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome presents a challenge. By understanding the immune status of a patient, physicians can consider manipulating proinflammatory systems more rationally. In this context, corticosteroids could be a therapeutic tool in the armamentarium against acute respiratory distress syndrome. Corticosteroid therapy has been studied in three situations: prevention in high-risk patients, early treatment with high-dose, short-course therapy, and prolonged therapy in unresolving cases. There are differences between the corticosteroid trials of the past and recent trials: today, treatment starts 2-10 days after disease onset in patients that failed to improve; in the past, the corticosteroid doses employed were 5-140 times higher than those used now. Additionally, in the past treatment consisted of administering one to four doses every 6 h (methylprednisolone, 30 mg/kg) versus prolonging treatment as long as necessary in the new trials (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1) every 6 h). The variable response to corticosteroid treatment could be attributed to the heterogeneous biochemical and molecular mechanisms activated in response to different initial insults. Numerous factors need to be taken into account when corticosteroids are used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome: the specificity of inhibition, the duration and degree of inhibition, and the timing of inhibition. The major continuing problem is when to administer corticosteroids and how to monitor their use. The inflammatory mechanisms are continuous and cyclic, sometimes causing deterioration or improvement of lung function. This article reviews the mechanisms of action of corticosteroids and the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the use of corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome.",,,,2005-03-24,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The aim of this study was to identify a non-invasive method for early detection of cardiac involvement in patients with Chagas disease. During a 6-month period in 2001, 133 people were studied using echocardiography and electrocardiography in Honduras; 88 were seropositive for Trypanosoma cruzi, of which 31 were asymptomatic, and 45 were seronegative controls. The echocardiographic assessment included geometrical and time interval derived indices. Patients with asymptomatic Chagas disease had increased left and right myocardial performance index (MPI) when compared with seronegative controls (P= 0.003 and P= 0.023, respectively) with 36% having a left MPI above the upper limit of the normal range. They also had a reduced diastolic posterior wall thickness (P= 0.005) and lower posterior wall thickness to left ventricular cavity (PWT:LVC) ratio (P= 0.002). Our results show that the MPI, a simple Doppler parameter, and the PWT:LVC ratio are useful in the early detection of myocardial involvement in asymptomatic patients with Chagas disease.

In some, medication was given during a run-in period. Safety controls were carried out on days 10, 20, 37 and 52 days after therapy initiation. A total of 249 patients between 15 and 44 years old were enrolled. At the end of the trial, 70.3% of the patients had completed the treatment, while 17.7% required its suspension due to BZ related adverse reactions.

In addition to its pathologic implications, trichomoniasis is a risk factor for the transmission of the HIV and is associated with reproductive complications in females. Diagnosis of the disease is problematic due to inadequate accuracy of current diagnostic methods. Recently developed DNA-based techniques for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis seem to be promising alternatives.
The goal of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Papanicolaou test for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis by comparing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with other current diagnostic methods.
A total of 1008 cervicovaginal swab specimens from a randomized population attending a gynecological service were analyzed in this study. In addition to current diagnostic methods, two sets of specific primers were used for PCR detection of T vaginalis in the cervicovaginal DNA samples, with a PCR quality control. Different examiners conducted PCR and Papanicolaou analyses in a double-blind trial.
The prevalence of trichomoniasis in this population was 6%. A considerable number of diagnostic results of the Papanicolaou test were false negative or false positive. Compared with PCR, specificity of the Papanicolaou test was 97.6%, whereas sensitivity was only 60.7%. The positive predictive value of the Papanicolaou smear was 61.7%. These results suggest that irregularly shaped parasites without clearly defined nuclei and flagella and bacteria-induced focal cytolysis limit the ability of the Papanicolaou test to detect T vaginalis.

A study was undertaken in two rural Chagas' disease endemic communities (96 households) of Trujillo State, Venezuela. After a baseline study (including a short questionnaire survey, assessment of housing conditions, vector behaviour and preferences in vector protection), 37 households were chosen at random for protection by impregnated or non-impregnated curtains. During the 30-day entomological study vector collection of triatomine bugs were conducted in the early morning. The protective efficacy of curtains was determined by the number of vectors found dead or alive in control and experimental houses. It was found that house infestation of Chagas' disease vectors was high (60% of houses) in spite of good-quality houses due to a re-housing programme. The vectors were sylvatic (mainly Rhodnius robustus) and entered the houses at night. More than half the population (52%) preferred curtains to bednets for Chagas' disease protection. Users of pyrethroid-impregnated curtains were well protected as no living triatomines were found in bedrooms of houses with impregnated curtains compared to houses with non-impregnated curtains where an average of 4/7 vectors were found alive in bedrooms. In houses with impregnated curtains 21/30 triatomines died within 72 h; the triatomines which survived were found exclusively in rooms where no impregnated curtains had been placed. In houses with non-impregnated curtains 20% (6/30) of vectors died, probably due to rough handling. It is concluded that pyrethroid-impregnated curtains represent an important option for the reduction or even elimination of man-vector contact and thus of Chagas' disease transmission in areas where species of small triatomine bugs such as Rhodnius prolixus and R. robustus are the main vectors.",,,,2003-08-29,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Among the 647 HIV-negative cohort participants, HIV incidence rate (IR) was 3.33 (95% CI 1.93-4.67) per 100 men-years, with 21 newly acquired HIV infections during 7572 men-months of observation. IR differences were observed in four categories: (1) non-commercial sex workers and non-transvestites who had protected sex prior to study entry (IR 1.6 per 100 men-years); (2) non-commercial sex workers and non-transvestites who had unprotected sex prior to study entry (IR 2.7 per 100 men-years); (3) commercial sex workers (IR 3.5 per 100 men-years); and (4) transvestite groups (IR 16.8 per 100 men-years). Unprotected penetrative anal sex was frequent (66%) in the 6 months before study entry, and when we take into consideration the fact that bisexual men engaged in unprotected vaginal intercourse with their female partners, the risk behavior in this group escalates to 73%. HIV seroconverters had high risk behavior prior to study entry (76%), and all but one admitted to having unprotected penetrative sex prior to infection.

12685636,Prevention of the transmission of Chagas' disease with pyrethroid-impregnated materials.,,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,"Interrupting the transmission of Chagas' disease using insecticide-treated materials could be a cost-effective option, particularly for sylvatic vectors, which enter houses at night. A randomized trial was undertaken that included all houses in two communities in regions endemic for this disease, one in Venezuela (50 houses) and one in Colombia (47 houses). After a baseline study (including a short questionnaire survey, entomologic assessment, and Chagas' disease serology), each household was randomly allocated to either the intervention group, which used pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets, or the control group, which used unimpregnated bed nets. Serologic analysis of children in the baseline study showed active transmission of Chagas' disease in the Venezuelan community (10.7% of 103 children were positive), but none in the Colombian community (0% of 100 children were positive). Vectors were sylvatic and bugs entered the houses at night in both communities. The efficacy of pyrethroids against triatomine vectors was tested in Venezuela by exposing Rhodnius prolixus to lambdacyhalothrin-impregnated fabrics and in Colombia by residual house spraying with deltamethrin. This randomized trial showed that in both countries users of impregnated bed nets were well protected from vector bites (immediate benefit). The long-term effect on the community was high vector mortality. In Venezuela, all 62 vectors detected (mainly R. robustus) died within 72 hours of contact with impregnated bed nets. In houses that used unimpregnated nets, only 24.5% (13 of 53) of the vectors died (P < 0.001). The vectors most likely came from infested palm trees and they maintained transmission of the disease in this community (28.1% of 629 R. robustus were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi). Bioassays showed that the mortality rate of R. prolixus was 100% on lambda-cyhalothrin-impregnated materials. In addition, in Colombia (the main vector was R. prolixus), the effect of repellent on vectors (driving them away from impregnated nets) was significant. Thus, users of impregnated bed nets are well protected from transmission of Chagas' disease, and vector reduction or elimination can potentially be achieved in areas infested with R. prolixus and R. robustus.",,,,2003-04-11,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
12662419,Itraconazole or allopurinol in the treatment of chronic American trypanosomiasis: the regression and prevention of electrocardiographic abnormalities during 9 years of follow-up.,,Annals of tropical medicine and parasitology,"Several drugs are now known to have useful activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of human American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). However, the long-term effects of chemotherapy on the electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities associated with this disease have only been assessed for benznidiazole. In the present study, the ECG changes in 299 cases of chronic Chagas disease were followed for 9 years after treatment with itraconazole (N = 136) or allopurinol (N = 163). Among the 97 cases who were found to have ECG abnormalities immediately prior to their treatment, the two drugs appeared equally effective, such abnormalities being corrected in 23 (50%) of the 46 cardiopathy cases given itraconazole and 25 (49%) of the 51 given allopurinol (P > 0.05). Both of these 'cure rates' are much higher than the 8.1% frequency of abnormal-normal conversion observed among 198 'historical controls' (i.e. cases of chronic Chagas disease who had been left untreated; P < 0.05). Itraconazole appeared better than allopurinol at preventing the development of cardiopathy in the cases who appeared electrocardiographically normal at baseline. Among 202 such cases, only two (2.2%) of the 90 treated with itraconazole but 28 (25.0%) of the 112 given allopurinol were found to have developed ECG abnormalities during follow-up (P < 0.05). Therefore, although itraconazole and allopurinol are equally effective at reversing ECG alterations, itraconazole offers better protection against the development of new ECG abnormalities among those with chronic Chagas disease.",,,,2003-03-29,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Chagasic achalasia affects between 7.1% and 10.6% of the population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Botox injections in the clinical response and esophageal function of patients with dysphagia due to chagasic achalasia. In total, 24 symptomatic patients with chagasic achalasia were randomly chosen to receive Botulinum Toxin (BT) or saline injected by endoscopy in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Patients were monitored with a clinical score of dysphagia and an objective assessment (esophagograms, scintillography, manometry, and nutritional assessment) for a period of 6 months. Clinical improvement of dysphagia was statistically significant (P < 0.001) in patients receiving BT when compared with the placebo. There was no significant difference in the placebo group regarding clinical score, LES basal pressure and esophageal emptying time. Esophageal emptying time in the toxin group was significantly lower than in the placebo (P=0.04) after 90 days. There were non-significant increases in esophageal emptying of 25.36% and 17.39%, respectively, at 90 and 180 days, in the BT group (P=0.266). Gender, age, and baseline LES pressure did not influence the response to BT. Our data strongly suggests that intrasphincteric injection of BT in LES is clinically effective in the treatment of chagasic achalasia.",,,,2003-02-13,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
12387906,The dog as model for chemotherapy of the Chagas' disease.,,Acta tropica,"In the present study, we investigated the role of dogs as experimental models for acute and chronic phases of Chagas' disease, before and after therapeutic treatments. Dogs were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi strains of different susceptibilities to benznidazole (Bz) and treated with the same therapeutic scheme as used for human chagasic. The treatment with Bz was able to prevent death and induced parasitological cure in 62.5% (acute phase) and 38.7% (chronic recent phase) of the tested animals. These results were similar to those reported in clinical trials for treated human patients (cured and uncured) in both phases of the disease. We also showed that parasitologic and serologic tests for monitoring the cure were similar to those obtained for human trials. In addition, Polymerase chain reaction showed the highest sensitivity when compared with hemoculture as an indicator of parasite clearance. In conclusion, the proposed experimental model should be relevant for chemotherapy studies for the control of Chagas' disease.",,,,2002-10-22,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
12214336,[Usefulness of botulinum toxin in gastrointestinal disorders].,,Revista de gastroenterologia de Mexico,"Botulinum toxin (Botox) produced by Clostridium botulinum is a potent neuromuscular blocker agent that inhibits acetylcholine release from presynaptic nerve endings. This effect was confirmed in the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract and led to clinical trials investigating the efficacy of Botox for treatment of several gastrointestinal disorders. Multiple controlled studies have shown that Botox is effective in short-term management of achalasia. Botox reduces lower esophageal sphincter pressure, improves esophageal clearance, and alleviates symptoms in up to 70% of patients; however, its long-term efficacy decreases to 30% and repeated injections are often necessary. Botox is reserved for older patients and with high surgical risk. The main predictors of a good response are older age and presence of vigorous achalasia. Biliary or pancreatic sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) has been another indication for Botox administration. Transendoscopic injection of Botox in the papilla of Vater has shown relief of symptoms in more than 50% of cases of SOD. Furthermore, a Botox clinical response in this condition can predict a long-term benefit with endoscopic sphincterotomy. Botox decreases resting anal pressure, has healing rates of approximately 80% at six months after injection in patients with chronic anal fissure, and has a better outcome than topic nitroglycerine. Case reports have shown good results with Botox administration in treatment of diffuse esophageal spasm, anismus, oropharyngeal dysphagia, anterior rectocele, and secondary achalasia. Administration of botulinum toxin has a low rate of adverse reactions and complications.",,,,2002-09-07,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
12209329,Blood culture and polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of the chronic phase of human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi.,,Parasitology research,"In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the profile of blood parasitism in untreated, chronic Chagas' disease. The study was conducted on 60 patients and a control group of nine serologically negative individuals. Analysis of three blood samples showed 70% cumulative positivity for blood culture and 86.7% positivity for PCR. The comparison of the two tests revealed that 41.1% (74/180) of the samples presented positive results for both PCR and blood culture, 22.2% (40/180) were positive for PCR alone, and 4.4% (8/180) were positive for blood culture and negative for PCR. The addition of the second sample raised positivity significantly for both blood culture ( P=0.0000) and PCR ( P=0.0369). Addition of the third sample was also statistically significant for blood culture ( P=0.0001) but not for PCR ( P=0.1186). These data point to the importance of studying the parasitemia of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected individuals before specific treatment. They also suggest that at least two blood samples should be collected and that two tests should be used, if possible--a procedure that considerably improves the parasitologic diagnosis of Chagas' disease and the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.",,,,2002-09-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
12036188,Impaired autonomic control of heart interval changes to Valsalva manoeuvre in Chagas' disease without overt manifestation.,,Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,"In the apparent indeterminate form of Chagas' disease, which lacks any overt clinical, electrocardiographic, and radiological manifestations of organ damage, lesions of the intrinsic autonomic innervation of heart are not striking features and evidences for cardiac autonomic dysfunction are elusive and conflicting.
To evaluate the cardiac autonomic modulation based on Valsalva manoeuvre-associated heart interval variation in Chagas' disease subjects with apparent indeterminate form.
We examined 36 outpatient volunteers aged 15-51 years old (median: 36.5), in comparison with 52 healthy control individuals aged 17-49 years old (median: 29) (p<0.001). Each subject sequentially performed in the supine position three to four manoeuvres at an intra-oral pressure of 40 mm Hg during 20 s, under continuous DII lead electrocardiographic registration, and rate- and time-dependent indices of Valsalva manoeuvre-associated R-R interval variation were obtained. The t-test or the Mann-Whitney test was employed to compare the data between the groups.
No correlation was found between every index and age for the control group (p=0.39-0.71). The chagasic group presented similar basal to phase IV median increment (relative bradycardia) (23.7% vs. 22.7%; p = 0.63) and smaller basal to phase III median decrement of R-R interval (relative tachycardia) (-31.7% vs. - 35%; p=0.02) in comparison to the control group, respectively. The median Valsalva ratio showed a tendency for reduction in chagasics (1.78 vs. 1.90; p = 0.08). Prolonged median time (14.2 vs. 10.3 s; p < 0.001) and slowed median velocity (5.1%/s vs. 8.9%/s; p < 0.001) of the phases III-IV bradycardia were also observed in chagasic group. The majority (58.3%) of the chagasics presented exclusively at least one depressed, and 8.3% presented at least one enhanced index of rate- and/or time-dependent heart interval responses beyond the 25th or 75th control percentiles, and 27.8% presented at least one depressed and other enhanced index, while 5.6% showed all indices within the control interquartile range. All the indices outside the 25th or 75th control percentiles were noted in 13.9% of chagasics.

The aim of present study was to identify rotavirus G serotypes and P[],G genotypes in cases of reinfection among children who participated in a vaccine trial with the tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV 4 x 10(4) pfu/dose) in Belém, Brazil. From July 1990 to June 1992, 540 children received, at their first, third and fifth months of life, oral doses of either vaccine or placebo. A total of 90 rotavirus diarrheal episodes among children who completed the three-dose vaccination schedule were recorded. We studied 11 reinfection rotavirus cases among five children (three female and two male). Fecal specimens were tested by using a enzyme immunoassay (IDEIA Rotavirus), followed by EIA with monoclonal antibodies to determine infecting serotypes Gl, G2, G3 and G4 and subgroups I and II. The viral dsRNA was extracted and electrophoresed through polyacrylamide gel and then subjected to reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction and nested-PCR for the determination of Gl, G2, G3, G4, G5 and G9 and P[4], P[6], P[8] and P[9] rotavirus genotypes. A total of 11 cases of reinfection (12 per cent) occurred among five children, three from the placebo group and two from the vaccine group. In four of the cases of reinfection G serotypes and P[],G genotypes were as follows: for the first and second infections, respectively: (1) G2/P[4],G2 and Gl/P[4],G1; (2) G2/P[4],G2 and G2/P[6],G5; (3) G2/P[4],G2 and G1/P[8],G1; and (4) G2/P[8],G1 and G1/P[8],G1. A fifth child had three successive infections caused by serotypes/genotypes G1/P[8],G1, in the first and second infections, and G2/P[4],G2 in the third infection. The common genotypes and unusual genotypes were detected in 8 (73 per cent) and 3 (27 per cent) of the isolates, respectively. With regards to the clinical severity, in two children a score indicated moderate/severe disease in both first and second infections. One child had three successive infections; the first episode was moderate/severe, the second very severe and the third was not available. In contrast, in two other children, the first episode was very severe, and the second episode was moderate/severe in one child and data was not available for the other child. The results obtained in the present investigation underscore the need to broaden our knowledge of the immunity in rotavirus reinfection. This should be useful regarding future rotavirus vaccination strategies in Brazil.",,,,2002-05-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11964893,Specific treatment of Chagas disease: current status and new developments.,,Current opinion in infectious diseases,"The current situation regarding specific chemotherapy for Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), and new developments in this field, are reviewed. Despite previous controversy on the autoimmune origin of Chagas disease pathology, available knowledge supports the notion that this condition should be treated as a parasitic, not an autoimmune, disease. Currently available drugs (nitrofurans and nitroimidazoles) are active in acute or short-term chronic infections, but have very low antiparasitic activity against the prevalent chronic form of the disease, and toxic side-effects are frequently encountered. The nitroimidazole benznidazole has also shown significant activity in the treatment of reactivated Trypanosoma cruzi infections in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and in other immunosuppressed patients with underlying chronic Chagas disease. Although the etiological agent, T. (Schizotrypanum) cruzi, requires specific endogenous sterols for cell viability and proliferation, the currently available antifungal sterol biosynthesis inhibitors are not powerful enough to induce parasitological cures of human or experimental infections. However, new triazole antifungal compounds, which are potent inhibitors of the sterol C14alpha demethylase of the parasite and have special pharmacokinetic properties, are capable of inducing parasitological cures in murine models of both acute and chronic Chagas disease. They are currently the most advanced candidates for clinical trials in patients with Chagas disease. Other potential chemotherapeutic agents against T. cruzi currently in development include antiproliferative lysophospholipid analogs (already in clinical trials as the first oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis), cysteine proteinase (cruzipain) inhibitors, and compounds that interfere with purine salvage and inositol metabolism.",,,,2002-04-20,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11896410,Long term evaluation of etiological treatment of chagas disease with benznidazole.,,Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,"The aim of this article is to present an investigation of cure rate, after long follow up, of specific chemotherapy with benznidazole in patients with both acute and chronic Chagas disease, applying quantitative conventional serological tests as the base of the criterion of cure. Twenty one patients with the acute form and 113 with one or other of the various chronic clinical forms of the disease were evaluated, after a follow up period of 13 to 21 years, for the acute, and 6 to 18 years, for the chronic patients. The duration of the acute as well as the chronic disease, a condition which influences the results of the treatment, was determined. The therapeutic schedule was presented, with emphasis on the correlation between adverse reactions and the total dose of 18 grams, approximately, as well as taking into consideration precautions to assure the safety of the treatment. Quantitative serological reactions consisting of complement fixation, indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination, and, occasionally, ELISA, were used. Cure was found in 76 per cent of the acute patients but only in 8 per cent of those with chronic forms of the disease. In the light of such contrasting results, fundamentals of the etiological therapy of Chagas disease were discussed, like the criterion of cure, the pathogenesis and the role of immunosuppression showing tissue parasitism in long standing chronic disease, in support of the concept that post-therapeutic consistently positive serological reactions mean the presence of the parasite in the patient's tissues. In relation to the life-cycle of T. cruzi in vertebrate host, there are still some obscure and controversial points, though there is no proof of the existence of resistant or latent forms. However, the finding over the last 15 years, that immunosuppression brings about the reappearance of acute disease in long stand chronic patients justifies a revision of the matter. Facts were quoted in favor of the treatment of chronic patients.",,,,2002-03-16,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11869663,Trypanocidal drugs for chronic asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi infection.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Prior guidelines stated that trypanocidal therapy should not be used for treating chronic asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi infections. However, the recent availability of clinical trials reporting high rates of parasitologic cure in children with early chronic T. cruzi infection have produced changes of these recommendations in some countries. Because of the uncertainty regarding best treatment for this stage of T. cruzi infections, the literature was reviewed systematically for a synthesis of the available evidence.
To assess the effects of trypanocidal therapy for chronic asymptomatic T. cruzi infection.
We searched The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2000), MEDLINE (start-Nov 1999), EMBASE (start - Feb 2000), LILACS (start - Feb 2000) and the Tropical Diseases Research Division of WHO database (Start - Feb 2000). Reference lists of articles were searched for relevant material.
Published RCTs of trypanocidal therapy for people with chronic, asymptomatic T. cruzi infections
Two reviewers independently screened papers for inclusion criteria, quality assessment and data extraction. Forms were used to collect data. Reviewers resolved differences by discussion then a third reviewer if necessary.
Of 43 papers assessed for inclusion, five RCTs (total population=756) met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the trials was rated as low (n=3) or intermediate (n=2). Two RCTs tested benznidazole in school children and three tested different agents in adults. The Odds Ratios and their 95%CI (Fixed models) were: Incidence of ECG abnormalities: 0.41 (0.09, 1.85); Negative seroconversion (AT ELISA): 10.91 (6.07, 19.58); Negative xenodiagnosis during the follow up: 5.37 (3.34, 8.64); Standardised mean reduction of antibody titres: 0.54 (0.31, 0.84). Nitroimidazolic derivatives substantially and significantly modified parasite-related outcomes compared to placebo. Other agents showed borderline or not significant effect.
Despite major public health importance, trypanocidal.therapy for chronic asymptomatic T. cruzi infection has been tested in few, small size RCTs which were designed to assess parasitic-related, but not clinical outcomes. Therefore, the potential of trypanocidal therapy to prevent Chagas' disease among asymptomatic, chronically infected subjects is promising, but remains to be evaluated. trypanocidal therapy, particularly nitroimidazolic derivatives given to children or adults with positive xenodiagnosis improve parasite-related outcomes. The large contrast between the burden of Chagas disease and the existing evidence on its prevention points the need to test these or newer agents in more and larger RCTs that include clinical endpoints.",,,,2002-03-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11860367,Chemotherapy of Chagas disease.,,Current pharmaceutical design,"In this article we review the current status of chemotherapeutic approaches for the specific treatment of Chagas disease or American Trypanosomiasis, as well as new rational approaches being developed as a consequence on the increased understanding of the biochemistry and physiology of its causative agent, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Currently available drugs (nitrofurans and nitroimidazoles), developed empirically over three decades ago, are unsatisfactory due to frequent toxic side effects and limited efficacy, particularly in the prevalent chronic form of the disease. Furthermore, studies of their mechanism of action have shown that their antiparasitic activity is inextricably linked to mammalian host toxicity. Recent advances in this field include the demonstration that new triazole derivatives, with selective inhibitory activity on the parasite's de novo sterol biosynthesis and special pharmacokinetic properties, can induce radical parasitological cure of both acute and chronic Chagas experimental disease. These compounds are active against nitrofuran- and nitroimidazole-resistant T.cruzi strains and maintain their activity even if the hosts are immunosuppressed and are thus logical candidates for clinical trials with Chagas disease patients. Inhibitors of cruzipain, a cathepsin L-like protease responsible for the major proteolytic activity in all stages of the life cycle of the parasite, can selectively block the proliferation of T.cruzi, both in vitro and in vivo and have curative activity in murine models of acute Chagas disease; a significant effort is being devoted to their development as antiparasitic drugs. Alkyl-lysophospholipids, which selectively block phosphatidyl-choline biosynthesis in T.cruzi, are promising antiparasitic agents with good oral activity and low toxicity. Other biochemical pathways have been identified as potential chemotherapeutic targets, including hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and metabolism of trypanothione and inorganic pyrophosphate.",,,,2002-02-28,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11591616,Dysregulation of peripheral and central chemoreflex responses in Chagas' heart disease patients without heart failure.,,Circulation,"The peripheral and central chemoreflexes are important autonomic mechanisms for regulating breathing and cardiovascular function. Although pathological inflammatory infiltration of the peripheral chemoreceptors and central nervous system has been reported in Chagas' disease, functional evaluation of chemoreflexes has not yet been performed.
The hypothesis that chemoreflex function is altered in patients with Chagas' heart disease (CH) but normal left ventricle function was tested in 12 CH patients and 13 matched control subjects. The ventilatory rate, minute ventilation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and venous norepi-nephrine responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia were determined. During hypoxia, the decrease in oxygen saturation was smaller in CH patients, despite a similar ventilatory response between groups. Both groups showed an increase in heart rate during hypoxia, but this response was blunted in CH patients. Although the mean arterial pressure response to hypoxia was similar in both groups, forearm vascular resistance significantly decreased in control subjects while remaining unchanged in CH patients. Moreover, a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine levels elicited by stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors was observed only in the CH group. During hypercapnia, the increase in minute ventilation was smaller in CH patients, who did not exhibit the increase in norepinephrine observed in control subjects.
These data suggest that CH potentiates respiratory, cardiovascular, and autonomic responses to peripheral chemoreceptor activation by hypoxia in patients with normal left ventricular function. The ventilatory and sympathetic responses to central chemoreceptor activation by hypercapnia, however, are significantly blunted.",,,,2001-10-10,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies were consistently lower one year after treatment than 10 years thereafter (P < 0.001). The blood of all treated and 93.7% of untreated Chagas patients yielded polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product from probes annealing to T. cruzi nuclear DNA, indicating active infection. Competitive PCR showed means +/- standard deviations of 20.1+/-22.6 T. cruzi/ml of blood from untreated and 13.8+/-14.9 from treated Chagas patients, but the differences between means were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Electrocardiograms recorded a gamut of alterations several-fold more frequent in Chagas patients, regardless of treatment, than in uninfected controls (P < 0.001). These results show that nitroderivative therapy for T. cruzi infections is unsatisfactory and cannot be recommended since it fails to eradicate the parasite or change the progression of heart disease in chronic Chagas patients.",,,,2001-06-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11342476,Influence of hypoxia on nitric oxide synthase activity and gene expression in children with congenital heart disease: a novel pathophysiological adaptive mechanism.,,Circulation,"Chronic hypoxia has been shown to modulate nitric oxide (NO) responses in different cell models, but the relationship between hypoxia and NO synthase (NOS) regulation in humans was not studied. We studied the relationship between endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) activities and expression and chronic hypoxia in children with cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart defects.
Right atrial tissue was excised from 18 patients during cardiac surgery. eNOS and iNOS activities were measured by conversion of L-[H(3)]arginine to L-[H(3)]citrulline. Gene expression of eNOS and iNOS was quantified by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The eNOS activity and expression were significantly reduced in cyanotic hearts compared with acyanotic hearts: 0.38+/-0.14 versus 1.06+/-0.11 pmol. mg(-1). min(-1) (P<0.0001) and 0.54+/-0.08 versus 0.80+/-0.10 relative optical density (ROD) of cDNA (P<0.0001), respectively. In contrast, iNOS activity and expression were significantly higher in cyanotic than in acyanotic children: 7.04+/-1.20 versus 4.17+/-1.10 pmol. mg(-1). min(-1) (P<0.0001) and 2.55+/-0.11 versus 1.91+/-0.18 ROD of cDNA (P<0.0001), respectively.
Hypoxia downregulates eNOS activity and gene expression in cardiac tissue from patients with cyanotic congenital heart defects. By contrast, iNOS activity and expression are increased in cyanotic children and may represent an alternative mechanism to counteract the effects of hypoxia in the cardiovascular system. Therefore, a novel adaptive mechanism during hypoxia is suggested.",,,,2001-05-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11262536,Doppler tissue imaging to evaluate early myocardium damage in patients with undetermined form of Chagas' disease and normal echocardiogram.,,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)","Chagas' disease can lead to severe and potentially lethal damage of cardiac function. Thus, the identification of contractile abnormalities in asymptomatic patients can be important for risk stratification in those patients. Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) is a new diagnostic modality for the study of regional and longitudinal contractility of the left ventricle. However, DTI has not been used for the assessment of Chagas' cardiopathy. The purpose of this study was to identify abnormalities related to longitudinal contractility by means of DTI in patients with an undetermined form of Chagas' disease and with normal echocardiogram and Doppler studies. Forty patients were studied, including 21 chagasic ones with normal electrocardiographic, radiologic, and echocardiographic studies, and 19 normal control individuals. All of the patients were submitted to DTI to evaluate longitudinal contractility in the various myocardial segments, including assessment of systolic and diastolic velocities and isovolumic contraction time (IVCT). Similar values were observed among the various systolic function rates in both groups, except for the IVCT along the septal wall, which was significantly higher in the chagasic group. DTI enabled the early detection of contractile abnormalities in patients with an undetermined form of Chagas' disease and with normal echocardiogram. Such abnormalities were particularly striking in the interventricular septum. The present study could be useful in risk stratification for those patients.",,,,2001-03-23,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11190969,Rotavirus vaccines and vaccination in Latin America.,,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,"Worldwide, rotaviruses account for more than 125 million cases of infantile gastroenteritis and nearly 1 million deaths per year, mainly in developing countries. Rather than other control measures, vaccination is most likely to have a major impact on rotavirus disease incidence. The peak incidence of rotavirus diarrhea occurs between 6 and 24 months of age. In developing countries, however, cases are not uncommon among children younger than 6 months. G serotypes 1 to 4 are responsible for most disease, but there are indications that in Brazil that G type 5 is of emerging epidemiological importance. Both homotypic and heterotypic responses are elicited during natural rotavirus infection, and the immunological response at the intestinal mucosal surface is probably the more consistent predictor of clinical immunity. With the primary objective of protecting children against life-threatening dehydrating diarrhea, many approaches to rotavirus vaccine development have been attempted. One vaccine, the tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV), was given licensing approval in the United States of America, introduced to the market, and later withdrawn. A number of studies have found better efficacy of RRV-TV in developed countries than in developing ones. Field trials with a 4 x 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) preparation of RRV-TV have been carried out in two countries in Latin America, Brazil and Peru. Those trials yielded protective efficacy rates against all rotavirus diarrhea ranging from 18% to 35%. Data from a large catchment trial in Venezuela with a higher RRV-TV dose, of 4 x 10(5) PFU/dose, indicated an efficacy rate of 48% against all rotavirus diarrhea and 88% against severe rotavirus diarrhea. It appears that breast-feeding does not compromise the efficacy of RRV-TV if three doses of the vaccine are administered. Similarly, possible interference of oral poliovirus vaccine with the ""take"" of the rotavirus vaccine can be overcome by giving three doses of the rotavirus vaccine or by using a higher-titer formulation of it. Wild enteroviruses, however, may cause primary rotavirus vaccine failure in developing countries. Studies in Peru with RRV-TV have shown a trend towards higher vaccine efficacy rates against ""pure"" (rotavirus-only) diarrheal episodes. Economic analyses made in the United States indicate that a vaccine that costs less than US$ 9 per dose would lead to a net savings in medical costs. To date, however, cost-benefit studies have not been done in developing countries. In the future, it is possible that some Latin American countries might adapt their polio production facilities to the preparation of rotavirus vaccines for human use. A year after RRV-TV was licensed for vaccination of infants in the United States, the occurrence of intussusception as an adverse event led to the vaccine's withdrawal from the market. The implications of that action, particularly for Latin America, will be addressed in this article, including the need to explore alternative rotavirus candidate vaccines, particularly through the conduct of parallel clinical trials in both developed and developing countries.",,,,2001-02-24,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
11139981,A narrow QRS does not predict a normal left ventricular function in Chagas' disease.,,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,"Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is a major prognostic determinant in Chagas' disease (ChD), a potentially fatal disorder which affects nearly 20 million individuals in Latin America. Therefore, reliable screening methods are needed to identify patients in need of a detailed evaluation of LV function. Since previous reports have suggested that a prolonged QRS duration may be an accurate predictor of LV dysfunction, the relationship between QRS duration and LV function was evaluated in ChD patients, in order to determine whether a narrow QRS on surface electrocardiogram (ECG) predicts a normal LV function. Ninety-eight patients with ChD and no other cardiac or systemic illness were underwent standard 12-lead ECG and Doppler echocardiogram (echo) examination. An investigator (blinded to the echo data) measured manually the QRS duration. LV dysfunction was defined by the presence of LV dilatation (LV diastolic dimension > 55 mm), depressed LV ejection fraction (LVEF < 0.50), segmental contractile abnormalities (SCA) or LV aneurysm. QRS duration was significantly correlated with LV diastolic dimension (r = 0.44, P = 0.000) and LVEF (r = 0.24, P = 0.016). A significant percentage of patients with QRS < 100 ms had abnormal systolic LV parameters, including LV dilatation (8.1%), reduced EF (10.2%), SCA (42.8%) and LV aneurysm (14.2%). A narrow QRS does not exclude the presence of significant global and segmental LV dysfunction in ChD patients. Since these abnormalities have prognostic and therapeutic implications, further evaluation of LV systolic performance is desirable in such patients.",,,,2001-01-05,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Therapeutic regimens with this first line drug have been frequently modified both, in dose and duration of therapy. A regimen of 20 mg/kg/day of pentavalent antimony (Sb5+) during four weeks without an upper limit on the daily dose is currently recommended for mucosal disease (""espundia""). Side-effects with this dose are more marked in elderly patients, more commonly affected by this form of leishmaniasis. According to our experience, leishmaniasis in Rio de Janeiro responds well to antimony and, in cutaneous disease, high cure rates are obtained with 5 mg/kg/day of Sb5+ during 30 to 45-days. In this study a high rate of cure (91.4%) employing this dose was achieved in 36 patients with mild disease in this same geographic region.

The assay took place in the county of Boa Viagem, Ceará State, with 1541 households, randomly separated into 4 groups. Two of them received focal spraying: PT, treated with deltamethrin indoors and in the peridomicile, and PL, which received slow-release malathion in the same circumstances. The other groups received conventional, i.e., total application: PT with deltamethrin in the intra- and peridomicile, and PL, which was treated with deltamethrin indoors and slow-release malathion in the peridomicile. Entomological surveys at 6 and 12 months post-treatment showed better results for mixed treatment, the PL group, probably due to good indoor performance for the pyrethroid and better performance of the slow-release formulation under the hostile peridomiciliary conditions.

11053710,Relation of regional sympathetic denervation and myocardial perfusion disturbance to wall motion impairment in Chagas' cardiomyopathy.,,The American journal of cardiology,"Impairment of sinus node autonomic control and myocardial perfusion disturbances have been described in patients with chronic Chagas' cardiomyopathy. However, it is not clear how these conditions contribute to myocardial damage. In this investigation, iodine-123 (I-123) meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and thallium-201 myocardium segmental uptake were studied in correlation with the severity of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction detected in various phases of Chagas' heart disease. Group I consisted of 12 subjects (43 +/- 4 years, 7 men) with no symptoms and no cardiac involvement on electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiography; group II consisted of 13 patients (48 +/- 3 years, 9 men) with abnormal resting ECG and/or echocardiographic segmental abnormalities, and LV ejection fraction of > or = 0.5; group III was comprised of 12 patients (59 +/- 3 years, 10 men) with more severe heart disease, LV dilation, and LV ejection fraction of < 0.5. Eighteen control volunteers (38 +/- 3 years, 9 men) were also included in the study. I-123 MIBG single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) segmental uptake defects were observed in group I (33%), group II (77%), and group III (92%). Quantitative analysis showed mean areas of reduced LV I-123-MIBG uptake: group I was 3.7 +/- 2.1%; group II was 8.3 +/- 2.3%; and group III was 19.0 +/- 3.3%. The differences between group I and both groups II and III were statistically significant (p < 0.001, analysis of variance test). Myocardial perfusion defects (reversible, fixed, and paradox) were observed in group I (83%), group II (69%), and group III (83%). A marked topographic association between perfusion, innervation, and wall motion abnormalities (assessed by gated-SPECT perfusion studies) was observed in all the groups. Defects predominated in the inferior, posterior lateral, and apical LV regions. Thus, extensive impairment of cardiac sympathetic function at the ventricular level occured early in the course of Chagas' cardiomyopathy and was related to regional myocardial perfusion disturbances, before wall motion abnormalities.

One-third of BT-treated cases either fail to respond or fail to sustain the response beyond 6 months. An explanation for BT therapeutic failure would be that the lower esophageal sphincter muscular layer (LES) may be missed as injection is delivered 'blindly'. We aimed to evaluate the percentage of exact endoscopically 'blind' LES punctures using echoendoscopy after the injection of BT for the treatment of Chagas' achalasia (CA). Five patients with CA (mean age 53 years) were randomized to receive 1.2 ml of BT or the same amount of saline injected endoscopically. Echoendoscopy was performed immediately after puncture. Patients were evaluated by the clinical score of dysphagia, radiological examination, upper endoscopy and esophageal manometry and followed up for 6 months. All puncture sites were identified: 17 out of 20 (85%) in the muscle layer and 3 out of 20 (15%) in the submucosa. The three patients in the treatment group showed clinical improvement (average clinical score fell from 14 to 2 after 7 days, and remained at 4 after 6 months of follow-up). The mean pressure of the LES dropped by 29%. Neither patient in the placebo group showed clinical improvement, and the mean pressure of the LES increased by 35%.

At this stage, diminished heart rate responses to atropine and propranolol are observed. Prior studies have shown that short term ganglioside treatment improves the responses to these agents, but there is no information about the long term effect of gangliosides and the evolution of antiGM1 titers. The effects of long term treatment with gangliosides on autonomic tests in patients with chagasic cardiodisautonomy and the evolution of antiGM1 titers were studied in 90 patients (57 men, 33 women, aged 25-60 years) with positive serology for Chagas disease and electrocardiogram showing sinusal bradycardia and incomplete right branch block, without cardiomegaly, with autonomic alterations by postural and Valsalva's tests. All patients were submitted to a test that consisted of intravenous injection of atropine 0.04 mg/kg followed 3 min later by intravenous injection of propranolol 0.2 mg/kg. During these tests heart rate and blood pressure were recorded continuously. Subsequently, 30 patients were treated with 100 mg/day of a mixture of gangliosides by intramuscular injection during 15 days in a row, followed by 40 mg/day during another 75 days. Another 30 patients received continuous treatment for 12 months. The remaining 30 patients were controls. The antiGM1 antibody circulating titers were determined before the treatment, at the third and 12th month. Seventy-four patients completed the study. Before treatment, the heart rate increased, though slightly, after the injection of atropine. After 3 months of ganglioside treatment a statistically significant increase in the response to atropine was recorded. In the controls at 12 months, the response to atropine remained increased without differences between the patients treated for 3 and 12 months. The control patients did not show any modification of the heart rate response during 12 months. Both ganglioside-treated groups showed an increase in the response to propranolol. The antiGM1 titer distribution was similar in both healthy subjects and chagasic patients. None of the patients had positive antiGM1 titers in basal conditions nor significant modifications after the ganglioside treatment. Chagasic cardioneuropathy was not associated in this study with high antiGM1 antibody titers. Chagasic patients showed a diminished heart rate response to atropine as well as to propranolol. Ganglioside treatment determined an increased heart rate response, particularly after atropine. Increased heart rate response was maintained until 1 year, without differences between the patients treated for 3 and 12 months.

Central events in host defence system- and immune-mediated damage are tightly regulated by cell adhesion molecules (CAM). Levels of sP-selectin and sVCAM-1 were measured in sera from 41 children with the indeterminate phase of Chagas' disease. Simultaneously, levels of soluble adhesion molecule were also quantified in Chagas' disease children undergoing specific chemotherapy with benznidazole. Levels of sP-selectin and sVCAM-1 were found to be elevated in children with indeterminate Chagas' disease before aetiologic therapy was started. However, a small group of patients showed sP-selectin and sVCAM-1 levels comparable to those of non-infected children. A positive correlation between levels of sVCAM-1 and sP-selectin in sera from Chagas' disease patients was found. There was a significantly greater decrease in the titres of sP-selectin and sVCAM-1 in those children receiving benznidazole therapy compared with those children receiving placebo. Measurement of soluble adhesion molecules revealed differences in the activation of the immune system in children with the indeterminate form of Chagas' disease.

10571438,Reappraisal of the Peruvian and Brazilian lower titer tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine efficacy trials: analysis by severity of diarrhea.,,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,"With the purpose of better understanding the efficacy of the lower titer [4 x 10(4) plaque-forming units (pfu)] tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV) against diarrheal episodes of different severities, the Peruvian and Brazilian efficacy data were reanalyzed with a 20-point scoring system. Mild, moderate/severe and very severe rotavirus diarrhea were scored as 0 to 8, 9 to 14 and >14, respectively.
In the Peruvian study one dose of vaccine yielded 64% (P = 0.04) protection against pure cases of rotavirus disease (i.e. those in which no other enteropathogen was found) with clinical scores ranging from 9 to 14. Protective efficacy against very severe rotavirus gastroenteritis could not be assessed because of the small number of cases. In Brazil there was a trend in preventing ""all"" and ""pure"" cases of rotavirus diarrhea scored 9 to 14 (44%, P = 0.06, and 45%, P = 0.08, respectively) and the vaccine was 75% (P = 0.02) protective against pure rotavirus diarrhea scored >14. No protection was observed for mild rotavirus diarrhea (scores <9). These data were compared with those from trials in Venezuela (4 x 10(5) pfu/dose), US (4 x 10(4) pfu/dose and 4 x 10(5) pfu/dose) and Finland (4 x 10(5) pfu/dose). Combining the Peruvian (one dose, pure cases) and Brazilian studies together, the levels of protection against 9- to 14-scored rotavirus diarrhea are comparable with those from the Venezuelan (47%) and American (57, 57 and 65%) efficacy trials. In Brazil the level of protection (75%) against pure, >14-scored rotavirus diarrhea is similar to the efficacy rates yielded in the three US trials (82, 80 and 69%) and the Finnish trial (100%) for episodes of the same severity.
Our reanalysis provides evidence that, at least against moderate/severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, RRV-TV, 4 x 10(4) pfu/dose is potentially as efficacious as RRV-TV, 4 x 10(5) pfu/dose, even in settings with very high rotavirus disease burden. The reanalysis of the Peruvian data suggests that one and three vaccine doses may yield similar efficacy rates. It is also suggested that vaccine efficacy against most severe episodes in Peru and Brazil was not evident because of the trial design used in those studies (i.e. prospective, active home surveillance rather than a catchment trial), resulting in too few cases of severe disease even in the placebo group. To confirm these findings, future trials with this vaccine are necessary in developing countries with high diarrhea morbidity rates. These trials should use catchment designs and focus on the evaluation of the efficacy of one or three doses of RRV-TV against moderate to severe/very severe rotavirus diarrhea.",,"In the Peruvian study one dose of vaccine yielded 64% (P = 0.04) protection against pure cases of rotavirus disease (i.e. those in which no other enteropathogen was found) with clinical scores ranging from 9 to 14.

In the last decades, vectorial and transfusional transmission has been diminished. However congenital forms, which were long unknown and are still poorly understood, and reactive forms, which occur in patients with acquired or induced immunodeficiency, have confounded conventional wisdom concerning the evolution of this disease. Several new diagnostic tools have been developed without replacing the traditional methods, e.g. the xenodiagnostic technique proposed by Brumpt. With regard to indirect diagnosis, further progress is needed to improve specificity and sensitivity as well as the discriminating ability of the numerous techniques now available.

Patients were divided in 2 different groups according to the HR at rest--group 1: > 65 beats per minute (bpm) and group 2: < or = 65 bpm, for a comparative study considering: 1) HR at stress test after the implantation; 2) arterial blood pressure at rest after the implantation and, 3) evaluation of the identified electrodes such as TIR-60-UP and others.
The group 1 had greater HR at rest, and a smaller variation of values at stress than group 2. This shows that with this type of stimulation system it is possible to control each patient separately. The values of blood pressure at rest and during stress were not different between groups. According to the factors analysed the TIR-60-UP electrode had the same performance as the others.

The reduction of triatomine infestation was 100% (47/47) in the combined intervention community, whereas in the community where housing improvement was carried out it was 96.4% (53/55). In the community where fumigation alone was used, the impact was 97.6% (40/41) in terms of domiciliary infestation. In all the houses where an intervention was made, an 18-month follow-up showed reinfestation rates of less than 10%. A serological survey of the population in the pre- and post-intervention periods revealed a shift in positive cases towards older age groups, but no significant differences were observed. The rate of seroconversion was 1.3% (three new cases) in the community with housing improvement only, but none of these cases could have resulted from vector transmission. The most cost-effective intervention was insecticide spraying, which during a 21-month follow-up period had a high impact on triatomine infestation and cost US$ 29 per house as opposed to US$ 700 per house for housing improvement.
Chagas disease is most commonly spread by vectors in areas where inadequate housing, crowding, and poor hygienic conditions facilitate the proliferation of triatomines and help to maintain their domestic cycle. Chagas disease is widely distributed in America, from the southern US to southern Argentina, with a prevalence of 5-60%. In 3 rural communities in Paraguay in a zone endemic for Chagas disease, insecticide spraying, housing improvement, and a combination of spraying plus home improvement were implemented in a field study to control the vectors of Chagas disease. The insecticide applied was lambdacyhalothrin in a wettable powder formulation, while houses were modified to have smooth, flat, crack-free walls and ceiling surfaces, as well as better ventilation and illumination. Each intervention effectively reduced the vector of Chagas disease, with triatomine infestation reduced by 100% in the combined intervention community, 96.4% in the community in which only houses were improved, and 97.6% in terms of domiciliary infestation where only fumigation was used. In all houses in which an intervention was made, an 18-month follow-up showed reinfestation rates of less than 10%.

We evaluated 12 pregnant women chronically infected with T. cruzi, their newborn infants, and three additional neonates with parasitemia at birth. The IgA-specific antibody was detected by adapting the procedure for use of a commercial IgG ELISA, the Hemagen Chagas' Kit (Hemagen Diagnostics, Inc., Waltham, MA). Trypanosoma cruzi-specific IgA was detected in 10 (83%) of 12 mothers at delivery, in one of three parasitemic infants, and one of 12 newborns of the chronically infected women. Testing of 13 infants at six months of age revealed IgA in seven infants (54%), of whom four also had persistent T. cruzi-specific IgG.

Blood samples were collected up to 24 hr after the administration of the morning dose, with discontinuation of the subsequent doses during the study period. Plasma concentrations of N-hydroxymexiletine glucuronide were calculated as the difference between the concentrations of unchanged and total (unchanged + conjugated) MEX enantiomers. Total plasma MEX concentrations were analyzed by HPLC after enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase, the formation of diastereomeric derivatives with the chiral reagent N-acetyl-L-cysteine/o-phthalaldehyde, and fluorescence detection. The differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of the enantiomers were evaluated by the paired t-test. The plasma concentrations of the (+)-(S)-MEX did not differ before and after enzymatic hydrolysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters calculated for (-)-(R)-N-hydroxymexiletine glucuronide are presented as means (95% confidence interval): maximum plasma concentration Cmax = 194.0 ng.ml-1 (154.3-233.7), time to maximum plasma concentration tmax = 1.4 hr (0.3-2.5), area under the plasma concentration versus time curve AUC0-24 = 2099.2 ng.h.ml-1 (1585.6-2612.6), elimination half-life t1/2 beta = 12.8 hr (9.9-15.6) and extent of conjugation of 31.6% (24.3-38.9%).

Six cardiologists from five countries each read 100 electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings, including 30 from chronic chagasic patients, then reread them after an interval of 6 months. The readings were blind, with the tracings numbered randomly for the first reading and renumbered randomly for the second reading. The physicians, all experienced in interpreting ECGs from chagasic patients, followed printed instructions for reading the tracings. Reproducibility of the readings was evaluated using the kappa (kappa) index for concordance. The results showed a high degree of interobserver concordance with respect to the diagnosis of normal vs. abnormal tracings (kappa = 0.66; SE 0.02). While the interpretations of some categories of ECG abnormalities were highly reproducible, others, especially those having a low prevalence, showed lower levels of concordance. Intraobserver concordance was uniformly higher than interobserver concordance. The findings of this study justify the use by specialists of the recording of readings method proposed for epidemiological studies on Chagas' disease, but warrant caution in the interpretation of some categories of electrocardiographic alterations.",,,,1999-01-12,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Twenty eight children were evaluated by using xenodiagnosis (XD) and PCR. Whereas XD detected 75.0% of the cases PCR was positive in 96.8%. The usefulness of the PCR was further investigated in the 28 children who have received specific treatment with nifurtimox. Negativation of XD after three and six months post treatment was observed in all the cases, but only 21.4% and 35.8% negativation of the PCR after three and six months post treatment respectively. These observations suggest that PCR is the most sensitive and quick technique available for direct detection of T. cruzi in chagasic children and that it can be a very useful tool for the follow-up of infected subjects after specific chemotherapeutical treatment.",,,,1998-11-27,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

A new technique to map the epicardial surface of the heart through pericardial puncture was presented recently and opened the possibility of using epicardial mapping to guide endocardial ablation or epicardial catheter ablation. We report the efficacy and safety of these two approaches to treat 10 consecutive patients with VT and Chagas' disease.
Epicardial mapping was carried out with a regular steerable catheter introduced into the pericardial space. An epicardial circuit was found in 14 of 18 mapable VTs induced in 10 patients. Epicardial mapping was used to guide endocardial ablation in 4 patients and epicardial ablation in 6. The epicardial earliest activation site occurred 107+/-60 msec earlier than the onset of the QRS complex. At the epicardial site used to guide endocardial ablation, earliest activation occurred 75+/-55 msec before the QRS complex. Epicardial mid-diastolic potentials and/or continuous electrical activity were seen in 7 patients. After 4.8+/-2.9 seconds of epicardial RF applications, VT was rendered noninducible. Hemopericardium requiring drainage occurred in 1 patient; 3 others developed pericardial friction without hemopericardium. Patients remain asymptomatic 5 to 9 months after the procedure. Interruption during endocardial pulses occurred after 20.2+/-14 seconds (P = 0.004), but VT was always reinducible and the patients experienced a poor outcome.

The amplification of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific kinetoplast DNA sequences in blood samples was compared with classical serological methods, specific IgM detection and direct parasite visualization for 268 school children in a single village where Chagas' disease transmission is active. Of 113 children positive by classical serology or buffy coat examination, 106 were detected by PCR (sensitivity: 93.8%). We did not observe any significant difference of PCR sensitivity between initial (IgM and/or buffy coat positive) and indeterminate stage (only IgG positive) patients. Among the remaining 155 children unconfirmed as chagasic (who were either only IgM positive, IgG-, IgM-, and buffy coat-negative) only 1 case was PCR positive. This case may be due to DNA contamination, or to a very recent infection not detected otherwise, or to specific immune depression. These results show that PCR is a very sensitive parasitological test for Chagas' disease in active transmission regions.

The clinical AIDS case definition should be as comprehensive as possible. In many countries, only the diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness will grant the affected patient social benefits or access to medical care. An expanded AIDS case definition is also likely to improve surveillance of HIV-associated morbidity and mortality; increase the awareness of emerging infections; increase the number of clinical endpoints in clinical trials; and facilitate the introduction of diagnostic tests, screening programs, and preventive measures.

We have examined the safety and efficacy of this drug in the treatment of the early chronic phase of T cruzi infection.
Between 1991 and 1995, we carried out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a rural area of Brazil with endemic Chagas' disease. 82% of 2434 schoolchildren (aged 7-12 years) identified in a census were screened for antibodies to T cruzi by indirect immunofluorescence, indirect haemagglutination, and ELISA. 130 were positive in all tests and were randomly assigned benznidazole (7.5 mg/kg daily for 60 days by mouth) or placebo. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the disappearance of specific antibodies (negative seroconversion) by the end of 3-year follow-up. The secondary endpoint was the reduction of antibody titres on repeated serological tests. One child moved away from the area just after randomisation and was excluded from the analyses. Insecticidal measures were taken throughout the trial to reduce the risk of reinfection.
Minor side-effects requiring no specific medication were recorded in a small proportion of individuals. On a chemiluminescent ELISA with purified trypomastigote glycoconjugate, serum from all participants was positive at the beginning of the trial. At the end of follow-up, 37 (58%) of the 64 benznidazole-treated participants and 3 (5%) of those who received placebo were negative for T cruzi antibodies. The efficacy of benznidazole treatment estimated by intention to treat was 55.8% (95% CI 40.8-67.0). At the end of follow-up, children who received benznidazole had five-fold lower geometric mean titres by indirect immunofluorescence than placebo-treated children (196[147-256] vs 1068[809-1408], p < 0.00001).

A total of 100 serum samples from patients with chronic Chagas' disease from Brazil and Argentina were studied. Sera from 116 patients, without Chagas' disease, including 10 with active mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and 20 with visceral leishmaniasis, were used as controls. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the ribosomal fraction (ribonucleoproteins [RNPs]) in the ELISA were found in 97% of samples from patients with Chagas' disease. A total of 99% of the sera from patients without the disease were negative, including sera from patients with mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniases. The distribution of IgG isotypes in randomly chosen serum samples was determined by ELISA; IgG1 and IgG3 were predominant (100% exhibited IgG1 and 85% exhibited IgG3, and 50% also presented the IgG2 isotype. The distribution of the IgG subclasses was confirmed by the Western blot (immunoblot) technique. When total IgG was assayed by Western blot assay, no correlation was found between the pattern of serum reactivity and the clinical features of the patients with Chagas' disease. Therefore, no typical profile of polypeptide recognition could be associated with any clinical form of Chagas' disease (cardiomyopathy or megaviscera). Our results showed that sera from patients with Chagas' disease react with ribosomal antigens and display a typical profile of IgG isotypes (IgG1 plus IgG3). The RNP ELISA seems to have improved specificity compared with those of routine techniques such as the indirect immunofluorescence assay and hemagglutination because it better discriminates between patients with Chagas' disease and patients without the disease. Since sera from patients with leishmaniasis failed to show cross-reactivity with this antigen, the ELISA seems useful for detecting Chagas' disease as well as confirming the nature of sera, when it is doubtful whether the patients has Chagas' disease, by the isotype distribution of IgG.",,,,1995-06-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

At random, on two separate days, the subjects received 5 mg isosorbide dinitrate or an identical-appearing placebo tablet, by the sublingual route, and ingested a liquid test meal containing [99mTc]phytate colloid before scintigraphic studies were performed. Gastroesophageal reflux episodes were more frequent (P = 0.016) and gastroesophageal reflux indexes were greater (P < 0.010) after isosorbide dinitrate than after placebo in CD-2 group (N = 15) but not in healthy volunteers (N = 14) or CD-1 group (N = 9); six of seven CD-2 patients presenting with gastroesophageal reflux after isosorbide dinitrate had abnormal clearance of refluxate. Gastric emptying was similar in healthy volunteers (N = 13), CD-1 patients (N = 6), and CD-2 patients (N = 13), and no effect of isosorbide dinitrate on it was detected in any of the groups. In separate studies, 5 mg isosorbide dinitrate reduced the lower esophageal pressure (P < 0.01) in seven CD-2 patients. These results indicate that ISD increases the tendency towards GER in CD-2 patients, but not in healthy volunteers or CD-1 patients. This effect is probably related to an exceedingly intense relaxation of the LES caused by ISD in CD-2 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,1995-01-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Referral tertiary care hospital in Cordoba, Argentina.
Thirty-seven chagasic patients (19 females and 18 males, mean age 41 +/- 12 years) were divided into three groups: group 1, 14 patients with positive serology for Chagas' disease but no evidence of cardiac involvement; group 2, 14 patients with Chagas' disease and electrocardiographic abnormalities but without signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure or cardiomegaly; and group 3, nine patients with Chagas' disease and evidence of cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure. Six healthy volunteers with no evidence of heart disease were used as controls.
All subjects received 0.04 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate followed 3 mins later by 0.2 mg/kg intravenous propranolol slowly injected. The resultant heart rate obtained with this total autonomic blockade (TAB) was considered to be the intrinsic heart rate observed (IHRo).
The mean increase of heart rate after atropine was +68 beats/min in controls, +45 beats/min in group 1, +45 beats/min in group 2 and +32 beats/min in group 3. The change from the basal heart rate to the IHRo after TAB with atropine and propranolol was +29 beats/min in controls, +17 beats/min in group 1, +17 beats/min in group 2 and +5 beats/min in group 3.
The observed response to atropine in patients with Chagas' disease suggests abnormality in the innervation of the sinus node.

The rectum is sectioned and closed at the level of the peritoneal reflexion. The end of the descending colon is anastomosed to the posterior surface of the rectum, as distal as possible, using the intraluminal stapler (Ethicon CDH33). The final result of the operation is similar to Duhamel-Haddad technique with the advantage of being a one stage operation. Forty-three patients with chagasic megacolon were operated on during the period 1989-1994. Twenty-seven were female and 16 were male with ages ranging from 23 to 76 and a mean of 46.1 years. Results obtained were satisfactory; there were no deaths; only three postoperative complications occurred (6.9%). Only one of these (dehiscence of the rectal cupula) was specific for the proposed technique. The two others were intestinal obstruction, due to volvulus of the small intestine in one case and to adhesions in the other. All complications were managed by surgery. All patients are being followed regularly and up to the present time they report daily bowel movements, passing well-formed stools. There are no complaints of fecal incontinence sexual function or disturbed formation of fecaloma in the rectal stump. The colorectal anastomosis was ample in all patients. Since this is a one stage operation with a low rate of complications, the short hospital stay largely compensates the cost of the mechanical suturing device.

The number of animals that could be evaluated in vaccinated versus control groups was 73 and 75 after one year and 49 and 40 after two years, respectively. Parasitologic evaluation by xenodiagnosis indicated that vaccination had reduced natural T. cruzi infection from 26.7% to 12.3% after one year (P = 0.015). The preventive effect of vaccination after the second year was less significant in spite of the booster vaccinations. Inclusion of indirect hemagglutination data for the diagnosis of infection slightly increased the number of infected dogs without affecting the evidence for protection in the first year. Serologic, parasitologic, and isoenzyme studies indicated that protection was mediated by an attenuated, self-cured infection.

Intracardiac impedance is measured with the ventricular electrode and the ventricular inotropic parameter (VIP) is derived from that. The VIP serves directly as input to the control of heart rate by the pacemaker. Over 200 patients have received autonomic nervous system (ANS) controlled pacemakers. The patient-pacemaker system was investigated in different ways. This included standard exercise tests, long-term studies of every day activities over 24 hours, psychological, and pharmacological challenges. To prove the validity of the approach we specifically looked at (1) the appropriateness of changes in paced heart rate with sympathetic tone during exercise, (2) the correlation between heart rate and sinus rate, if detectable, and (3) the correlation between the echocardiographically determined preejection period (PEP) and the VIP controlled heart rate.",,,,1992-11-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
1420743,Short report: comparison of the effects of sublingual nifedipine and isosorbide dinitrate on oesophageal emptying in patients with Chagasic achalasia.,,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,"The effects of sublingual nifedipine and isosorbide dinitrate on oesophageal emptying were compared in 11 patients with Chagasic achalasia. The oesophageal emptying of a radiolabelled test meal was assessed three times in each patient by a scintigraphic technique. No treatment preceded one of the studies (basal study). Nifedipine (20 mg) by the sublingual route 30 min before the meal, preceded one study. Isosorbide dinitrate, 5 mg by the sublingual route 5 min before the meal, preceded the third study. The order of the studies was allocated randomly for each patient. Oesophageal retention at the completion of the meal was significantly less (P less than 0.01) after isosorbide dinitrate (median: 54%, range: 5-87%) than after sublingual nifedipine (median: 78%, range: 7-99%) or after the control study (median: 83%, range: 5-100%). This difference persisted up to 20 min after the meal. Values measured in the control study and after sublingual nifedipine were not different (P greater than 0.10). These results show that isosorbide dinitrate, but not sublingual nifedipine, enhances oesophageal emptying in Chagasic achalasia.",,,,1992-08-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv
1644089,Chagas cardiomyopathy and captopril.,,European heart journal,"Chagas disease is a leading cause of heart failure in Latin America. Sudden death occurs in approximately 40% of patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease. We report a single blind, cross-over trial of prolonged treatment with captopril and placebo in 18 Chagas disease patients with class IV NYHA heart failure. Ventricular dimensions, neurohormones, electrolytes and ventricular arrhythmias were analysed in 11 men and seven women receiving stable doses of digoxin and frusemide who were randomly divided into two intervention groups. Group I patients were given increasing doses of captopril up to 150 mg.day-1 maintained for 6 weeks, group II received the placebo. A 24 h Holter, 2-D echocardiogram, urinary catecholamines, plasma renin and electrolyte determinations were performed at the end of each phase. After a 2-week washout period, the two groups crossed over and another period of 6 weeks was observed. Ventricular arrhythmias were analysed by either Mann-Whitney or the Wilcoxon test. Remaining data were assessed by the Student t-test. A significant reduction in heart rate and urinary catecholamine levels, and enhanced plasma levels of renin, together with a reduction in ventricular couplets was found in the captopril-treated group. We conclude that captopril has a beneficial effect on neurohormones with a subsequently reduced heart rate and diminished incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease. This effect might result in a reduction of mortality caused by the disease, suggesting the need for further investigations.",,,,1992-07-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

One hundred and fifteen patients with CHF, 46 (40%) class II and 69 (60%) class III, on conventional treatment (digitalis and diuretic) were the subject of this study. The age ranged from 22 to 75 years (mean 56.6 +/- 11); 67 were male and 66 were caucasians. The etiologies of the heart failure were: hypertensive heart disease 47 (40.9%), ischemic heart disease 27 (23.5%), Chagas cardiomyopathy 20 (17.4%), idiopathic cardiomyopathy 15 (13.0%), and other causes 6 (5.2%). Diuretic and digitalis were maintained in the same dosage during all the treatment. Captopril therapy was started with 6.25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., and the dosage was increased gradually to 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. The duration of the study was 12 weeks. Clinical visits occurred every four weeks and laboratory tests were performed in the beginning and at the end of the study.
The dosage of captopril ranged from 12.5 to 75 mg (mean 28.5 +/- 13.1 mg/day). The addition of captopril to the conventional therapy of CHF was associated with significant reduction (p < 0.01) of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The reaction with this alpha-digalactose was further confirmed when the sera were tested in radioimmunoassay (RIA) binding assay and in ELISA with synthetic galactose alpha 1-3 galactose coupled to human serum albumin. The circulating antibody appeared restricted to the IgG class and mostly to the subclass IgG3 and IgG4. Antibodies with the same specificity can be found in patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis and Chagas disease; however, whilst in these diseases the antibody production is triggered by antigenic determinants present on the surface of the parasites, the events eliciting their appearance in systemic sclerosis are unknown.",,,,1991-12-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

The safety, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of single and multiple oral doses of allopurinol riboside, an investigational antiparasitic agent, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 32 healthy male volunteers, at levels up to 25 mg/kg q.i.d. for 13 doses. No significant toxicity was detected. Allopurinol riboside peaks in plasma 1.6 hours after administration, has an elimination half-life of 3 hours, and steady-state concentrations in the therapeutic range. However, in contrast to preclinical studies in dogs (plasma levels proportional to oral doses up to 200 mg/kg), we found that plasma levels were unexpectedly low and did not rise with increasing dose. Furthermore, allopurinol and oxypurinol (unanticipated metabolites) were detected at levels proportional to the dose of allopurinol riboside. We present a model that includes incomplete absorption, metabolism of residual drug by enteric flora, and absorption of bacterial metabolites to explain these findings in humans.",,,,1991-05-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out to determine the efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate (ISD) on dysphagia in patients with Chagasic achalasia. 2. Twenty-three patients with Chagas' disease and dysphagia entered the study and 20 (87%) completed the two 7-day treatment periods. Subjects were given either 5 mg ISD (12 patients) or placebo (11 patients) by the sublingual route for the first 7 days. On the 8th day, patients crossed over and began another 7-day period during which they received the opposite, identical-appearing tablets. 3. Scores attributed by uninformed investigators for the frequency and severity of dysphagia were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) following ISD treatment than after the placebo period or for the pretreatment condition. A significantly higher degree of improvement of dysphagia was experienced by the patients during ISD treatment than during the placebo period. Fourteen patients experienced meal-related headaches during ISD, but not placebo treatment. The extent of improvement in general well-being due to ISD was the same when the drug was given in the first or second test period. 4. Our results indicate that ISD, 5 mg by the sublingual route, is effective in alleviating dysphagia in patients with Chagasic achalasia but its usefulness is limited by the high rate of headache as a side effect.",,,,1991-01-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

We used affinity-purified parasite proteins to develop a direct dot-blot assay for VL. Double-blind tests were carried out on sera from 40 patients with well-documented VL, from controls in endemic areas, and from patients with other diseases. Using gp70-2, 36 (90.0%) of 40 sera from patients with kala azar were correctly diagnosed; 1 (1.2%) of 86 sera from patients without kala azar was misdiagnosed. With dp72, 21 (100%) of 21 sera from patients with VL were correctly identified; 5 (7.0%) of 71 negative sera were misdiagnosed.

Treatment with Amiodarone and Flecainide were compared using an open, parallel, randomized experimental design. Inclusion criteria required the selected patients to have 1,200 premature ventricular contractions per 24 hours and/or repetitive ventricular arrhythmias. Patients received 60 days of treatment with either Flecainide at 200 to 400 mg per day or Amiodarone 800 to 400 mg per day. This dosage was adjusted to the therapeutic response. Clinical and laboratory evaluations, electrocardiogram and 24 hour Holters were performed at study days: -7, -1, 8/9, 15/16 and 59/60. The percentage reduction of premature ventricular contractions at days 9, 16 and 60 were: 73.1%, 82.9% and 92.4% with Flecainide and 77.6%, 90.1% and 90.7% with Amiodarone. At the end of the study, Flecainide had induced a 92.5% reduction in couplets and 96.5% reduction in ventricular tachycardia. For the same parameters the percentages following Amiodarone were 95.2% and 92.6% respectively. Treatment was discontinued in three patients in the Flecainide group (two because of prolonged sinus node bradycardia and one because of sustained ventricular tachycardia).

Consequently, assessment of cure still remains controversial. This paper reports the influence of specific treatment on antibodies involved in the conventional serological diagnosis and on antibodies which bind to the living bloodstream forms and are related to host resistance. Antibodies lytic to Trypanosoma cruzi bloodstream stages were detected, through a complement-mediated lysis (CML) test, in: (a) 100% of 28 untreated patients; (b) 94% of a group of 21 treated patients in whom conventional serology remained positive, including those with persistently negative xenodiagnosis; (c) 0% of 17 normal controls. In some patients treated with a nitrofuran derivative (nifurtimox) or with a 2-nitroimidazole derivative (benznidazol), CML test became gradually negative whereas conventional serology continued to be positive. Finally, in five patients treated with benznidazol, serological tests, CML and xenodiagnosis became regularly negative, strongly suggesting parasitological cure. Those findings demonstrate a dissociation between the antibodies mediating serological diagnosis and those directed against living bloodstream parasites. Moreover, since in some patients both types of antibodies disappeared after treatment, the results suggest that cure of Chagas's disease should be based not only on negative xenodiagnosis but also on the elimination of specific antibodies detectable by conventional serology and CML test.",,,,1982-01-01,Pubmed_Chagas_Disease.csv

Perfused intraluminal manometric studies were performed on all patients. Resting sphincter pressures ranged from 20-35 mm./Hg., mean of 25 (normal 5-12 mm./Hg.) with aperistalsis. Patients were randomly dilated with either bouginage (44-55 ff catheter) or pneumatic dilator (4-4.5 kg./6.5 cm.2 x 2 min.). Although all patients reported symptomatic improvement several days after either procedure, repeat manometric tracings demonstrated no change in the sphincter pressure in the bouginage group. The pneumatically dilated group, however, demonstrated a decrease in sphincter pressure to normal levels (mean 12 mm./Hg.).
