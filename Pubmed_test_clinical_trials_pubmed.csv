40074606,A comparison of the effectiveness of standard anterior bracket placement versus smile arc protection method: A randomized clinical trial.,"Bracket positioning, Smile analysis, Smile arc, Smile arc protection approach",Journal of the World federation of orthodontists,"This randomized two-arm parallel trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of standard anterior bracket positioning with the smile arc protection (SAP) method in terms of occlusal and smile morphometric indices, and perceived post-treatment smile aesthetics.
Patients needing nonextraction orthodontic treatment were randomly assigned to either the SAP or standard bracket placement group. Inclusion criteria were ages 11 to 25 years, nonextraction treatment, and good oral hygiene, all treated using the Roth 0.018 system. Primary outcomes assessed occlusal and smile morphometric changes using cephalograms, study models, and photographs. Perceived smile aesthetics was evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Statistical analyses included independent t-tests, paired t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and analysis of covariance.
Forty-two patients (mean age, 19.5 ± 5.5) were randomized evenly between the SAP and standard groups. Baseline characteristics were similar, and one patient from the SAP group was excluded. No significant differences were found between the groups for occlusal and smile morphometric variables before and after treatment (P > 0.05). Post-treatment, the smile arc significantly improved in the SAP group compared to both the standard method (P = 0.005) and its pretreatment state (P = 0.005). VAS scores from orthodontists and laypersons showed no significant differences (P > 0.05), but general dentists rated the SAP group's smiles as more attractive (P = 0.002).
The SAP method was more effective in achieving a consonant smile arc than conventional bracket positioning. While other occlusal and morphometric changes showed no significant differences, general dentists found the SAP group's smiles more attractive. Further research is needed to confirm these results.

40074518,A Revised Optical Coherence Tomography-Derived Calcium Score to Predict Stent Underexpansion in Severely Calcified Lesions.,"optical coherence tomography, percutaneous coronary intervention, severe calcified plaque, stent(s)",JACC. Cardiovascular interventions,"Severe calcification is the morphology most strongly associated with stent underexpansion.
The aim of this study was to revise an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-derived calcium score to predict stent underexpansion in severely calcified lesions (angle >270°) using a point-based system.
A retrospective observational study was conducted in which 250 de novo lesions undergoing OCT-guided stenting, with angiographically visible calcium and optical coherence tomographic maximum superficial calcium angle >270°, not subjected to atherectomy or specialty balloon treatment before stent implantation, were randomly divided into derivation (n = 167) and validation (n = 83) cohorts. The endpoint was stent expansion (minimum stent area/average of reference luminal area) at the maximum calcium deposition site, and stent expansion <70% was considered underexpansion.
Stent underexpansion was present in 19.6% of lesions (49 of 250). In the multivariable linear regression model, the morphologic characteristics associated with stent expansion in the derivation cohort were: 1) calcium >270° with a length longer than 3 mm (regression coefficient = -10.3; 95% CI: -17.8 to -2.8; P = 0.007); 2) calcium angle of 360° (regression coefficient = -15.5; 95% CI: -25.2 to -5.8; P = 0.002); and 3) minimum calcium thickness >0.30 mm (regression coefficient = -12.4; 95% CI: -19.1 to -5.6; P = 0.0004). In the validation cohort, the calcium score (range: 0-3) was significantly correlated with stent expansion (regression coefficient = -9.1; 95% CI: -12.6 to -6.1; P < 0.0001).
This revised OCT-derived calcium score can serve as a reliable tool for identifying severely calcified lesions at risk for stent underexpansion.",,"Stent underexpansion was present in 19.6% of lesions (49 of 250).

40074465,Efficacy of Acoramidis on All-Cause Mortality and Cardiovascular Hospitalization in Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy.,"ATTR-CM, acoramidis, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related hospitalization, transthyretin",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an underdiagnosed chronic disease associated with progressive heart failure that results in impaired quality of life, repeated hospitalizations, and premature death. Acoramidis is a selective, oral transthyretin stabilizer recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ATTR-CM. In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study (ATTRibute-CM [Efficacy and Safety of AG10 in Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy]), acoramidis was well tolerated and showed clinical efficacy in improving the primary endpoint, a hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular-related hospitalization (CVH), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and 6-minute walk distance.
The goal of this study was to characterize the efficacy of acoramidis on ACM and CVH.
In ATTRibute-CM, participants with ATTR-CM were randomized 2:1 to receive acoramidis hydrochloride (800 mg twice daily) or placebo for 30 months. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intention-to-treat population (participants with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m
Of the 632 participants randomized to treatment, 611 (97%) were included in efficacy analyses (acoramidis, n = 409; placebo, n = 202). Compared with placebo, acoramidis reduced the occurrence of the composite of ACM or first CVH (acoramidis, 35.9%; placebo, 50.5%; HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.50-0.83; P = 0.0008) and of first CVH (acoramidis, 26.7%; placebo, 42.6%; HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45-0.80; P = 0.0005), with Kaplan-Meier curves separating at month 3 and continuing to diverge through month 30.

40074281,Effectiveness of primary-contact physiotherapy in managing musculoskeletal conditions in emergency departments: protocol for the RESHAP-ED randomised controlled trial.,"Emergency Departments, Health Services, Musculoskeletal disorders, Randomised Controlled Trial",BMJ open,"Patients with musculoskeletal conditions often seek care in an emergency department (ED). The problem is that the time required to manage these patients places an additional pressure on ED physician and nursing staff, who are primarily trained and resourced to manage high-acuity patients. Primary-contact physiotherapists could play a greater role in supporting ED physician and nursing staff in the management of patients presenting to the ED with musculoskeletal conditions.
The RESHAP-ED trial is a multicentre, pragmatic, open-label, two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial with nested process and economic evaluations. The trial will investigate whether a primary-contact physiotherapy pathway compared with usual care (primary-contact by physician and/or nursing staff pathway) reduces time spent in ED. Patients with simple musculoskeletal conditions will be recruited from EDs in New South Wales, Australia. The primary outcome is ED length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes will include acceptability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of primary-contact physiotherapy, and explore patients' and clinicians' experience. To detect a 30 min between-group difference in ED LOS, 1370 patients will be required. Analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. The adjusted mean difference in ED LOS and 95% CI will be calculated using linear regression adjusted for hospital using a random effect model.
The study received ethical approval from the Sydney Local Health District (RPAH zone) Human Research Ethics Committee (X23-0143). Findings from this study will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

40074277,Impact of silicone midline catheter tip location on catheter-related complications and indwelling duration: results from a multicentre randomised clinical trial in China.,"Clinical Trial, Health & safety, Nurses, Nursing Care",BMJ open,"To explore the impact of the terminal tip location of silicone midline catheter (MC, a type of intravenous catheter measuring 20-30 cm in length and inserted into upper arm veins using a modified Seldinger technique) in the subclavian vein group versus axillary vein group on catheter-related complications and indwelling duration.
This is a randomised controlled study.
Twenty-seven tertiary hospitals in China.
Between September 2022 and October 2023, 2307 patients underwent MC placement and were randomly assigned to either the axillary vein group (n=1124) or the subclavian vein group (n=1183).
There were two outcome measures: one was to compare the incidence of catheter-related complications (eg, catheter-related thrombosis, infection, catheter occlusion, etc.) between the two groups, and the other was to compare the indwelling duration between the groups.
The total observed incidence of catheter-related complications in the axillary vein group and subclavian vein group was 1.0% (11/1124) and 0.8% (10/1183), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the total incidence of catheter-related complications.

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive modality that has demonstrated efficacy in adult populations with primary headaches and has shown safety in adolescents with mental health disorders. However, its effectiveness in managing acute headache episodes and preventing recurrences in paediatric populations remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate the immediate analgesic effects of taVNS during acute headache episodes and its preventive efficacy over a 4-week period. Additionally, we will investigate potential biomarkers associated with primary headaches and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of taVNS through electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiography (ECG) assessments.
This study will employ a double-blind, randomised clinical trial design involving 288 children and adolescent participants diagnosed with primary headaches. The study will consist of two substudies: the acute period (AP) study and the preventive period (PP) study. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either taVNS or sham stimulation. The primary outcome for the AP study will be the reduction of pain intensity 2 hours after treatment, as measured by the visual analogue scale, while the PP study will assess the change in the headache attack days over the treatment period. Secondary outcomes will include EMG and ECG parameters.
The study will adhere to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and has received ethical approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University (NFEC-2024-057), on 2 January 2024. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants or their guardians. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant scientific conferences.

40074264,Understanding stigma as a barrier to cancer prevention and treatment: a qualitative study among people living with HIV in Uganda and Zambia.,"HIV & AIDS, ONCOLOGY, PUBLIC HEALTH, Patient-Centered Care, Smoking Reduction",BMJ open,"Extended life expectancy due to treatment improvements has increased the diagnosis of cancer among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Africa. Despite documented impacts of stigma on cancer preventive behaviours and care, little is known about the intersections of cancer and HIV stigma and the effects on prevention and care behaviours for both conditions. This study aims to examine experiences and drivers of cancer stigma and their associations with access to and utilisation of cancer prevention services among PLWH.
This was a qualitative study consisting of eight focus group discussions with PLWH and 14 key informant interviews with HIV healthcare providers collected in January 2024.
Data were collected from two districts of Uganda and Zambia. In Uganda, the two selected districts were Arua, in the northern West Nile region, and Moroto, in the northeast Karamoja region. In Zambia, the study districts were Mongu, in the Western Province, and Chipata in the Eastern Province.
Each study district held two PLWH focus groups (one male, another female) with 5-7 participants per group and 3-4 key informant interviews for a total of 55 participants. PLWH and healthcare providers were eligible if they were (1) aged 18 years or older and (2) an HIV-positive client receiving antiretroviral therapy services at the participating clinic or working in a health services capacity at the clinic.
Cancer stigma drivers included widespread misconceptions about disease origins and outcomes, associations with other stigmatising conditions and behaviours such as HIV, TB, and substance use, limited treatment options that heightened fears of diagnosis and inadequate training of healthcare providers. Study participants noted that experiences of stigma led to reduced treatment-seeking behaviours among PLWH, increased social isolation, and poor cancer-related care practices within clinics. Recommended interventions to combat stigma included improved education for providers and patients, private counselling, and peer support.
Results underscore the presence and impacts of stigma in the study population, emphasising the need for research informing culturally sensitive interventions that enhance educational outreach and promote engagement in care among targeted populations.

We reran the searches from the end of the original search to 3 December 2024.
We systematically screened titles, abstracts and full texts of retrieved records.
We included observational studies on any populations and regions, covering health services such as doctor visits, hospital admissions, diagnostic examinations, pharmaceutical therapies and mental health (MH) services. Only studies using validated scales to assess psychological distress or mental disorders as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were included.

Ensuring that the correct chemotherapy treatment plan is used is paramount.
The objectives of this report were to: (1) highlight the initial design of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool that was intended to help ensure the correct matching of research studies to research chemotherapy medications, (2) discuss the issues identified with the CDS tool, and (3) review the redesign of the tool that was done to overcome the issues identified.
We previously utilized an interruptive alert developed by Epic Systems ® to identify mismatches between a patient's chemotherapy plan and research study. We identified an issue with the logic of the alert resulting in the alert firing inappropriately.
We estimate that the chemotherapy-research plan alert fired when 93.4% of treatment plans were applied (17.3 alerts/provider/year). A high number of misfiring alerts were identified due to the inclusion of our institution name as both (1) a ""tag"" in the research protocol, and (2) as an unallowed tag in the research study record. Since the tag was included in all protocols, but also unallowed in all research records the alert fired with the application of almost all treatment plans. We developed a new mechanism to provide CDS that did not involve an interruptive alert. Within the research study record we manually associate compatible treatment plans to that study record, then when an oncologist goes to order chemotherapy the system prioritizes display of compatible treatment plans to the oncologist. The goal of the redesigned CDS approach is to eliminate interruptive alerts, while ensuring the correct chemotherapy plan is selected.

40074078,Distinct neuronal vulnerability and metabolic dysfunctions are characteristic features of fast-progressing Alzheimer's patients with Lewy bodies.,,The Journal of biological chemistry,"Tau protein accumulation is linked to dementia progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with potential co-pathologies contributing to it. The progression of dementia in AD patients varies between individuals, and the association between co-pathology and heterogeneity in dementia progression rate remains unclear. We used longitudinal cohort data, postmortem brain tissues, and biochemical methods such as immunoassays and proteomic profiling to investigate the molecular components associated with progression rate. We report that AD with comorbidities, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and TDP-43 pathology, progress faster than AD alone. AD-DLB patients had higher levels of soluble oligomeric tau proteins and lower levels of insoluble tau proteins compared to those with AD alone. Our data suggest that α-synuclein fibrils may enhance tau aggregation through cross-seeding. The prefrontal cortex is more vulnerable to Lewy body pathology than the temporal cortex, and Tau and α-synuclein aggregate in distinct neuronal populations, indicating selective neuronal and regional vulnerability to their respective pathologies. Dysfunctional metabolic pathways were more strongly associated with fast-progressing AD-DLB patients.

Our objective was to validate the real-time performance of a bedside prototype of SWE computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) as proof of concept.A bedside module for real-time use evaluated histological disease activity when endoscopy was performed in the rectum and sigmoid based on white-light endoscopy and SWE (410 nm monochromatic light). Biopsies were taken for reference and scored using the Geboes score (GBS). SWE-CAD displayed a blue or red indicator, corresponding to histological remission or non-remission, respectively. Simultaneous scoring using the Mayo Endoscopic Score was performed by the endoscopist.In 36 patients, histological disease activity was automatically scored using SWE-CAD.

40073963,20-Week Toxicity Study of Rotigotine Behenate Extended-Release Microspheres for Intramuscular Injection in Sprague Dawley Rats.,,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"Based on the concept of continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS), Rotigotine Behenate extended-release microspheres for injection (RBEM) are currently under development. To support human clinical trials of RBEM, a 20-week repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted. SD rats intramuscularly received RBEM (60, 180, and 540 mg/kg) once every 4 weeks for 5 repeated doses followed by a 12-week recovery period, no clear sex difference was noted in the plasma exposure of rotigotine in rats, and the exposure generally increased in a dose-proportional manner. No obvious systemic toxicity occurred. Ovarian corpus luteum and breast acinar hypertrophy in rats were believed to be associated with the activation of dopamine receptors by RBEM and decreased prolactin levels. The reversible vacuolar degeneration or foamy macrophage infiltration at the injection site, adjacent tissues, and alveoli of rats were associated with local inflammation and foreign body removal reaction caused by PLGA and SCMC. In this study, the non-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) in rats was 540 mg/kg (based on rotigotine), which was equivalent to 24 times the maximum clinical recommended dose of RBEM, 448 mg/person/28 days (expressed as the dose of rotigotine behenate). In conclusion, RBEM exhibited a good safety margin and can be used in phase I clinical trials.

We assessed the effects of different maxillary expansion appliances on skeletal structure and dentoalveolar and soft tissue in cleft lip/palate patients. We searched the PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane, and LILACS databases through September 2024; that investigation was augmented by a manual search. We focused on clinical trials, either retrospective or prospective trials. The outcomes of interest included skeletal, dentoalveolar, and soft tissue changes obtained from study models, cephalometric radiographs, or cone beam computed tomography.
Of the 430 screened articles, only six satisfied our eligibility criteria and were included in the quantitative synthesis. These articles exhibited a moderate overall risk of bias. None of the appliances conferred better forward skeletal maxillary movement than the hyrax. The iMini-M was the most effective appliance for increasing maxillary skeletal width (mean: 0.89 mm [range: 0.01-1.78 mm]), with the hyrax following closely behind. The Haas appliance exhibited the largest inter-molar distance (mean: 4.76 mm [range: 2.53-6.99 mm]), followed by the EDO, iMini-M and the hyrax. The fan-type appliance was the least effective at resisting maxillary premolar tipping (14.46° [2.60-26.32]), and the iMini-P was the most effective at reducing molar tipping (-3.54° [-6.06- -1.02]).
Considering the limited and moderate risk of bias, the iMini-M was the most effective appliance at increasing maxillary skeletal width compared with the hyrax; the Haas achieved the largest inter-molar distance. The fan-type appliance excelled at resisting premolar tipping, and the iMini-P offered the best control for molar tipping.

40073909,Gut Microbial Control of Neurotransmitters and Their Relation to Neurological Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.,,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,"The study explores the vital role of gut microbiota in regulating neurotransmitters and its subsequent effects on brain function and mental health. It aims to unravel the mechanisms by which microbial metabolites influence neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling. The ultimate goal is to identify potential therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota for the management and treatment of neurological disorders, such as depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety, and Parkinson's disease. The review synthesizes current research on the gut-brain axis, focusing on the influence of gut microbial metabolites on key neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It incorporates a multidisciplinary approach, linking microbiology, neurobiology, and clinical research. Each section presents an in-depth review of scientific studies, clinical trials, and emerging therapeutic strategies. The findings highlight the intricate interplay between gut microbiota and the central nervous system. Gut microbes significantly impact the synthesis and signaling of crucial neurotransmitters, which play a pivotal role in neurological health. Evidence supports the hypothesis that modulating gut microbiota can alter neurotransmitter output and alleviate symptoms associated with neurological disorders. Notable therapeutic potentials include microbiota-targeted interventions for managing depression, ASD, anxiety, and Parkinson's disease. This comprehensive analysis underscores the critical connection between gut microbiota and neurological health. By bridging gaps between microbiology, neurobiology, and clinical practice, the study opens avenues for innovative therapeutic approaches. It provides a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and students, emphasizing the need for continued investigation into gut microbiota's role in neurological disorders and its therapeutic potential.",,,,Thieme.

40073878,Mental Health After Childbirth in Women with Previous Bariatric Surgery: The SPOtMom Pilot Study.,,"Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association","Currently, no data are available using standardized instruments for evaluating the postpartum mental health of women with previous bariatric surgery. The aim of this pilot study was to assess postpartum mental health in women following bariatric surgery and to establish appropriate tools for a prospective registry study in the future. In this survey, the mental health of 22 women during the first weeks postpartum was examined (T1) and their status at least 6 months after childbirth was prospectively assessed (T2). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were evaluated with standardized questionnaires and depression was diagnosed with structured diagnostic interviews (SCID-5). At T1, 3/22 women (14%) reported depressive or anxiety symptoms, and in these women, the diagnosis of depression was established. In comparison with T1, at T2, symptomatology for depression or anxiety increased to 32% and 27% of patients, respectively, but only one woman was diagnosed with depression. In comparison to patients without symptoms, patients with signs of depression or anxiety or both had lower total body weight loss and, more often, a personal or family history of depressive disorders. Our pilot study suggests that the rate of postpartum depression in women after BS might be higher than in the general population. High symptom levels of depression and anxiety emphasize the necessity of long-term bariatric follow-up care. Further research is needed to evaluate if prevalence of depression or anxiety disorder or both is higher in this patient group as compared to other patients after bariatric surgery.",,,,"The Author(s).

However, there is a need to confirm these findings in clinically relevant conditions.
This in situ study adopted a five-leg cross-over design. In each leg, 28 subjects wore their mandibular partial denture with two previously demineralized enamel slabs treated with one of the following FV (selected based on our previous in vitro data): Vanish™ (high-%SMHr, low-EFU), Flor-Opal® (low-%SMHr, high-EFU), Enamel-Pro® (high-%SMHr, high-EFU), PreviDent® (generic, commercial reference) or Negative control (no varnish). After three days, specimens were wrapped in gauze to allow plaque accumulation on the enamel. Toothbrushing of natural teeth was performed twice/day with F-free toothpaste. After 14 days, enamel specimens were collected and analyzed (%SMHr and EFU). Data were analyzed by ANOVA models suitable for cross-over (alpha=0.05).
Vanish™ had a significantly higher %SMHr; other varnishes did not differ from each other and had higher %SMHr than the control. EFU was significantly lower for the control than for all other treatments; Flor-Opal® had significantly lower EFU than Vanish™ and PreviDent®. Neither %SMHr nor EFU in vitro data could predict in situ results, although better approximation was observed for %SMHr.

40073847,Prehabilitation-Are There Sex and Gender-Specific Issues in Surgery Preparation?,,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,"Prehabilitation programs have advanced considerably; however, critical issues related to sex- and gender-specific factors remain largely unaddressed. Historically, research has been male-centered due to the underrepresentation of females in clinical trials, often attributed to concerns over hormonal variability. This focus has resulted in significant knowledge gaps and potential biases that impact effectiveness across sexes. We aim to highlight the need for integrating sex- and gender-specific considerations into prehabilitation to optimize surgical outcomes and promote equitable care for all patients.
Both biological (sex-related) factors, such as differences in muscle mass, metabolism, and body composition, and social (gender-related) factors, such as caregiving roles and stress management, influence individuals' responses to pre-surgical preparation. A review of the existing literature reveals a scarcity of data on sex and gender differences in prehabilitation, highlighting a major barrier to designing equitable and effective programs. Evidence underscores that comprehensive prehabilitation approaches, integrating physical, nutritional, and psychological elements, must account for these differences to optimize recovery outcomes.
Sex- and gender-specific factors significantly shape patients' responses to prehabilitation and should be systematically incorporated into program design. The current lack of research on these differences limits the effectiveness of prehabilitation strategies, emphasizing the need for focused investigations. Addressing these gaps will facilitate the development of tailored, equitable prehabilitation programs that enhance pre-surgical care and improve recovery outcomes for all patients.",,,,"The Author(s).

The search for natural alternatives to antibiotics that can effectively inhibit H. pylori has become a pressing concern. In the present study, the potential anti-H. pylori activity of organic acids in sea buckthorn was investigated. Sea buckthorn organic acid extracts (SOA) inhibited H. pylori growth at a minimal inhibitory concentration of 10 mg/mL. Oxalic, tartaric, L-malic, ascorbic, lactic, citric acid were detected in SOA with the concentration of 0.512, 14.446, 13.111, 2.699, 0.303, 1.822 mg/g, respectively. Notably, malic, oxalic and tartaric acid had pronounced anti-H. pylori properties by inhibiting biofilm formation, increasing outer membrane permeability, disrupting membrane integrity, decreasing urease activity and altering membrane protein conformation. The three organic acids could suppress H. pylori urease genes (ureA, ureB), virulence genes (VacA, CagA), replication genes (dnaE, dnaN, dnaQ), transcriptional genes (rpoA, rpoD, rpoN), motility genes (flhA, flaA, flgE), adhesion genes (alpA, alpB, hpaA, hpaZ) and outer membrane protein genes (BabA), and had an inhibitory capacity on VacA and CagA protein expressions. Furthermore, three organic acids may reduce the production of pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H. pylori-induced GES-1 human gastric mucosal epithelial cells, contributing to the amelioration of inflammation induced by H. pylori infection. It might provide a theoretical basis for subsequent animal and clinical trials, and potentially be applied as a promising value-added food ingredient candidate for protecting human against gastric diseases caused by H. pylori infection.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier GmbH.

In face-to-face studies, group-based interventions yield more favorable outcomes than individual interventions, but the effect of the intervention form has not been studied in combination with eHealth.
This study investigated whether a minimal, 3-session group or individual enhancement could provide additional benefits compared to an eHealth-only intervention when assessing weight, body composition, and laboratory metrics in a sample of occupational health patients with obesity.
This study was a randomized controlled trial with a 12-month intervention, followed by a 12-month follow-up period without additional support (March 2021 to March 2023). Recruited from occupational health care for Finnish municipal employees, 111 working-age adults with a BMI of 30-40 kg/m
There were no between-group differences in primary measurements of weight change or categorical weight change. Secondary outcomes also did not show changes attributable to the intervention arm. Across the entire sample, the total weight loss was 1.5% during the intervention, with 18% (20/111) of the participants attaining a ≥5% weight loss. Sustained at follow-up, waist circumference decreased, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased slightly. The participants completed, on average, 58.6% of the eHealth program.
There were no differences in weight or other somatic health variables between the eHealth arm and intervention combining eHealth with minimal group or individual enhancement. Despite a modest overall weight loss, the intervention shows promise in improving body composition and metabolic health. Moving forward, further research is needed to determine if there is a threshold where face-to-face meetings provide additional benefits in hybrid interventions. Moreover, there is a need to explore for whom and under what conditions eHealth and hybrid models may be most effective.

Secondary outcomes also did not show changes attributable to the intervention arm. Across the entire sample, the total weight loss was 1.5% during the intervention, with 18% (20/111) of the participants attaining a ≥5% weight loss.

40073398,Patient Perspectives on Conversational Artificial Intelligence for Atrial Fibrillation Self-Management: Qualitative Analysis.,"atrial fibrillation, conversational agents, conversational artificial intelligence, digital health, patient perspective, qualitative research, self-management, speech recognition",Journal of medical Internet research,"Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) allows for engaging interactions, however, its acceptability, barriers, and enablers to support patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are unknown.
This work stems from the Coordinating Health care with AI-supported Technology for patients with AF (CHAT-AF) trial and aims to explore patient perspectives on receiving support from a conversational AI support program.
Patients with AF recruited for a randomized controlled trial who received the intervention were approached for semistructured interviews using purposive sampling. The 6-month intervention consisted of fully automated conversational AI phone calls (with speech recognition and natural language processing) that assessed patient health and provided self-management support and education. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.
We conducted 30 interviews (mean age 65.4, SD 11.9 years; 21/30, 70% male). Four themes were identified: (1) interaction with a voice-based conversational AI program (human-like interactions, restriction to prespecified responses, trustworthiness of hospital-delivered conversational AI); (2) engagement is influenced by the personalization of content, delivery mode, and frequency (tailoring to own health context, interest in novel information regarding health, overwhelmed with large volumes of information, flexibility provided by multichannel delivery); (3) improving access to AF care and information (continuity in support, enhancing access to health-related information); (4) empowering patients to better self-manage their AF (encouraging healthy habits through frequent reminders, reassurance from rhythm-monitoring devices).
Although conversational AI was described as an engaging way to receive education and self-management support, improvements such as enhanced dialogue flexibility to allow for more naturally flowing conversations and tailoring to patient health context were also mentioned.

Treatments for this disease often result in side effects such as pain, fatigue, loss of muscle mass, and reduced quality of life. Physical exercise has been shown to effectively mitigate these side effects and improve the quality of life in patients with breast cancer.
This randomized clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-week supervised exercise program on pain, physical function, and quality of life in female patients with cancer.
This randomized, double-blind clinical trial will recruit 325 participants, divided into an intervention group receiving the exercise program and a control group receiving standard care recommendations. Outcome measures, including pain (assessed via the Brief Pain Inventory), physical function (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire), and quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-BR23), will be evaluated at baseline, immediately post intervention, and 12 weeks post intervention. Statistical analysis will involve repeated measures of ANOVA and MANOVA to determine the significance of the intervention's effects across time points.
Recruitment and data collection will commence in February of 2025, and data analysis is scheduled for completion at the end of 2025. No results are currently available.
Physical exercise is anticipated to play a significant role in alleviating pain, enhancing physical function, and improving the quality of life in female patients with cancer. This study will provide robust evidence to support the integration of supervised exercise into standard care protocols for this population.

Discoveries of druggable cancer drivers enabled biomarker-driven gene- and immune-targeted therapy and transformed cancer treatment. Minimizing treatment not expected to benefit, and toxicity-including financial and time-are important goals of modern oncology. The Worldwide Innovative Network (WIN) Consortium in Personalized Cancer Medicine founded by Drs. John Mendelsohn and Thomas Tursz provided a vision for innovation, collaboration and global impact in precision oncology. Through pursuit of transcriptomic signatures, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, global precision cancer medicine clinical trials and input from an international Molecular Tumor Board (MTB), WIN has led the way in demonstrating patient benefit from precision-therapeutics through N-of-1 molecularly-driven studies. WIN Next-Generation Precision Oncology (WINGPO) trials are being developed in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic settings, incorporate real-world data, digital pathology, and advanced algorithms to guide MTB prioritization of therapy combinations for a diverse global population. WIN has pursued combinations that target multiple drivers/hallmarks of cancer in individual patients. WIN continues to be impactful through collaboration with industry, government, sponsors, funders, academic and community centers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders to tackle challenges including drug access, costs, regulatory barriers, and patient support. WIN's collaborative next generation of precision oncology trials will guide treatment selection for patients with advanced cancers through MTB and AI algorithms based on serial liquid and tissue biopsies and exploratory omics including transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and functional precision medicine.

A prospective, open-label, non-inferiority, multicenter trial including hospitalized patients requiring a diagnostic lumbar puncture in seven hospitals in France.
Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) either to receive no specific advice on oral fluid intake (FREE-FLUID), or to be encouraged to drink 2 liters of water (CONTROL) within the 2 hours after lumbar puncture. The primary outcome was the post-dural puncture headache rate within the 5 days after lumbar puncture, with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. The secondary outcome was the time-to-post-dural puncture headache onset between Day 0 and Day 5.
From November 2016 and July 2019, we have included 554 participants. The primary outcomes occurs in 33.1% patients in the FREE-FLUID group, versus 38.0% in the CONTROL group with adjusted difference of 3.7%.
Among patients who had lumbar puncture, our study shows the noninferiority of the absence of specific advice on water intake after a lumbar puncture, compared with advice to increase oral fluid to prevent a post-dural puncture headache.
The value of questioning the appropriateness of non-evidence-based nursing care may allow time to be devoted to more relational and comforting care.
The study adheres to the CONSORT reporting guidelines.

A systematic review.,"Rotator cuff, chronic pain, glenohumeral joint, postoperative outcomes, shoulder pain","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)","To assess if implementing interventions to effectively manage preoperative chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain in patients undergoing rotator cuff repair (RCR) can improve shoulder surgery outcomes.
A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA and SIGN guidelines. Randomized clinical trials (RCT), metanalysis, systematic revisions and cohort studies in Spanish/English, published within the last 10 years, evaluating interventions to control preoperative chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain in patients undergoing RCR and their impact in postoperative shoulder outcomes were included. Selected records were graded following the 2011 Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence (OCEBML). RCT were graded using the PEDro scale.
Twenty-nine records were included in the analysis. Evidence suggests that preoperative chronic moderate to severe shoulder pain is the strongest risk factor for postoperative shoulder pain (OCEBML III). Patient-related factors and shoulder pain characteristics can also influence surgery outcomes (OCEBML II/III). Predictors of better shoulder function at 2 years after surgery include higher preoperative scores on the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index and the Constant-Murley score in the contralateral shoulder (OCEBML III). Preoperative analgesia to control shoulder pain can improve postoperative pain (OCEBML I). Preoperative patient teaching and intensive postoperative follow-up also improve pain intensity and function (OCEBML II).

40073206,"Atrial fibrillation burden in clinical practice, research, and technology development: a clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology Council on Stroke and the European Heart Rhythm Association.","AF burden, Atrial fibrillation, Clinical outcome, ECG monitoring, Heart failure, Mortality, Quality of life, Stroke","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac diseases and a complicating comorbidity for multiple associated diseases. Many clinical decisions regarding AF are currently based on the binary recognition of AF being present or absent with the categorical appraisal of AF as continued or intermittent. Assessment of AF in clinical trials is largely limited to the time to (first) detection of an AF episode. Substantial evidence shows, however, that the quantitative characteristic of intermittent AF has a relevant impact on symptoms, onset, and progression of AF and AF-related outcomes, including mortality. Atrial fibrillation burden is increasingly recognized as a suitable quantitative measure of intermittent AF that provides an estimate of risk attributable to AF, the efficacy of antiarrhythmic treatment, and the need for oral anticoagulation. However, the diversity of assessment methods and the lack of a consistent definition of AF burden prevent a wider clinical applicability and validation of actionable thresholds of AF burden. To facilitate progress in this field, the AF burden Consensus Group, an international and multidisciplinary collaboration, proposes a unified definition of AF burden. Based on current evidence and using a modified Delphi technique, consensus statements were attained on the four main areas describing AF burden: Defining the characteristics of AF burden, the recording principles, the clinical relevance in major clinical conditions, and implementation as an outcome in the clinic and in clinical trials. According to this consensus, AF burden is defined as the proportion of time spent in AF expressed as a percentage of the recording time, undertaken during a specified monitoring duration. A pivotal requirement for validity and comparability of AF burden assessment is a continuous or near-continuous duration of monitoring that needs to be reported together with the AF burden assessment. This proposed unified definition of AF burden applies independent of comorbidities and outcomes. However, the disease-specific actionable thresholds of AF burden need to be defined according to the targeted clinical outcomes in specific populations. The duration of the longest episode of uninterrupted AF expressed as a time duration should also be reported when appropriate. A unified definition of AF burden will allow for comparability of clinical study data to expand evidence and to establish actionable thresholds of AF burden in various clinical conditions. This proposed definition of AF burden will support risk evaluation and clinical treatment decisions in AF-related disease. It will further promote the development of clinical trials studying the clinical relevance of intermittent AF. A unified approach on AF burden will finally inform the technology development of heart rhythm monitoring towards validated technology to meet clinical needs.",,,,"© The European Society of Cardiology 2025.

40073085,Modulation of germinal center and antibody dynamics via ipsilateral versus contralateral immunization against SARS-CoV-2.,"B cells, SARS-CoV-2, germinal centers, ipsilateral/contralateral, vaccination","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","Human clinical trials have reported immunological outcomes can differ between ipsilateral (same side) and contralateral (alternate sides) prime-boost vaccination. However, our mechanistic understanding of how keeping or shifting the anatomical sites of immunization impacts the resultant germinal centers (GCs) and antibody responses is limited. Here, we use an adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine to dissect GC dynamics in draining lymph nodes and serological outcomes following ipsilateral or contralateral prime-boost vaccination in C57BL/6 mice. Contralateral vaccination elicited independent GCs at distinct lymph nodes, where robust secondary GCs only appeared upon secondary distal vaccination, while ongoing GCs from the primary site were not boosted. In contrast, ipsilateral vaccination resulted in sustained GC activity. Ipsilateral vaccination accelerated the development of antibody titers against ancestral (wild-type [WT]), Beta, and BA.1 but were later comparable between ipsilateral and contralateral groups in terms of magnitude, durability, and neutralization capacity beyond 28 d. Using a heterologous SARS-CoV-2 WT/BA.1 spike prime-boost model, cross-reactive GC responses were generated against WT and BA.1 spike, with analogous serological and GC dynamics to our homologous model. Within the cross-reactive GC B cells, differential recognition of WT and BA.1 antigens was observed and were further compartmentalized in primary or secondary GCs, depending on ipsilateral or contralateral regimes. Collectively, maintaining a common prime-boost site augments the kinetics of memory B cell recall and transiently drive higher antibody titers, but longer-term serological outcomes are unaffected by the anatomical localization of immunization.",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.

40073082,Augmenting rehabilitation robotics with spinal cord neuromodulation: A proof of concept.,,Science robotics,"Rehabilitation robotics aims to promote activity-dependent reorganization of the nervous system. However, people with paralysis cannot generate sufficient activity during robot-assisted rehabilitation and, consequently, do not benefit from these therapies. Here, we developed an implantable spinal cord neuroprosthesis operating in a closed loop to promote robust activity during walking and cycling assisted by robotic devices. This neuroprosthesis is device agnostic and designed for seamless implementation by nonexpert users. Preliminary evaluations in participants with paralysis showed that the neuroprosthesis enabled well-organized patterns of muscle activity during robot-assisted walking and cycling. A proof-of-concept study suggested that robot-assisted rehabilitation augmented by the neuroprosthesis promoted sustained neurological improvements. Moreover, the neuroprosthesis augmented recreational walking and cycling activities outdoors. Future clinical trials will have to confirm these findings in a broader population.",,,,,10.1126/scirobotics.adn5564,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Hankov', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N',

40073039,Low-dose ferric carboxymaltose vs. oral iron for improving hemoglobin levels in postpartum East Asian women: A randomized controlled trial.,,PloS one,"Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is widely used to correct anemia and replenish iron stores rapidly, particularly in Western populations. However, lower doses of FCM are typically used in East Asia, with limited research on their effectiveness, especially in postpartum women. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of low-dose FCM compared with oral ferrous sulfate in increasing postpartum hemoglobin (Hb) levels and replenishing iron stores in East Asian women. Sixty postpartum women with Hb levels < 10 g/dL and serum ferritin ≤ 30 ng/mL were randomized to receive either intravenous FCM (500 mg at baseline and 2 weeks) or oral ferrous sulfate (210 mg daily for 4 weeks). The primary outcome was the increase in Hb levels at 2 weeks post-enrollment. Secondary outcomes included serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score, and adverse events at 4 weeks. The FCM group demonstrated a significantly greater increase in Hb levels at 2 weeks (mean difference 0.42 g/dL; 95% CI: 0.12-0.72; P =  0.006), with markedly higher ferritin (adjusted mean difference 356.0 ng/mL; 95% CI: 321.0-403.0; P <  0.001) and transferrin saturation (adjusted mean difference 10.76%; 95% CI: 4.20-17.31; P =  0.002) at 4 weeks. Although there was no significant difference in final Hb levels at 4 weeks (mean difference 0.36 g/dL; 95% CI: -0.01-0.72; P =  0.055), the FCM group had a lower median EPDS score (median difference -3.0; 95% CI: -5.0 to -1.0; P =  0.002) and fewer gastrointestinal side effects, including constipation and nausea. Hypophosphatemia occurred asymptomatically in three patients in the FCM group. These findings suggest that low-dose FCM infusion is highly effective in increasing Hb levels at 2 weeks post-enrollment, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects and higher ferritin levels observed at 4 weeks post-enrollment compared with oral ferrous sulfate.

40072884,Cognitive Fluctuations in a Rare Disease Population: Leveraging Cognitive and Speech Ecological Momentary Assessment in Individuals with Phenylketonuria.,,JMIR formative research,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare, hereditary disease that causes disruption in phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. Despite early intervention, individuals with PKU may have difficulty in several different cognitive domains, including verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive functioning.
The overarching goal of the Evaluating Fluctuations in Cognitive and Speech Characteristics in Phenylketonuria study (CSP Study) is to characterize the relationships among cognition, speech, mood, and blood-based biomarkers (Phe, Tyr) in individuals with early treated PKU. We describe our initial optimization pilot results that are guiding the ongoing CSP Study, while establishing feasibility and reliability of using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in this clinical population.
Twenty adults with PKU were enrolled in this study between December 2022 and March 2023 through the National PKU Alliance. Eighteen participants completed an extended baseline assessment followed by six EMAs over one month. The EMAs included digital cognitive tests measuring processing speed, sustained attention, executive functioning, as well as speech (semantic fluency) and mood measures. Participants had 60 minutes to complete the assessment; completion rates were around 70% (on average 4.78 out of 6 EMAs).
Completion rates of EMAs were above 70%, with stable performances across baseline measures and EMAs. Between person reliability (BPR) of the EMAs, representing the variance due to differences between individuals versus within individuals, is satisfactory with values close to (semantic fluency BPR: 0.7, sustained attention BPR: 0.72) or exceeding (processing speed: 0.93, executive functioning: 0.88) those data collected from a large normative database (N= 5039-10703), as well as slightly below or matching a prior study using a clinical group (N=18). As applicable, within person reliability was also computed; we demonstrated strong reliability for processing speed (0.87). A control analyses ensured that time of day (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening) did not impact performance; performance on tasks did not decrease if tested earlier versus later in the day (all ps>0.09). Similarly, to assess variability in task performance over the course of all EMAs, the coefficient of variability was computed: 28% for the task measuring sustained attention, 37% percent for semantic fluency, 15.8 % for the task measuring executive functioning, and 17.6% for processing speed. Performance appears more stable in tasks measuring processing speed and executive functioning than on tasks of sustained attention and semantic fluency.
Preliminary results of this study demonstrate strong reliability of cognitive EMA, indicating that EMA is a promising tool for evaluating fluctuations in cognitive status in this population. Future work should refine and expand the utility of these digital tools, determine how variable EMA frequencies might better characterize changes in functioning as they relate to blood-based biomarkers, and validate a singular battery that could be rapidly administered at scale and in clinical trials to determine progression of disease.",,"Completion rates of EMAs were above 70%, with stable performances across baseline measures and EMAs.

40072880,Neuroprotective Effects of Metformin in Stroke Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies.,,Clinical neuropharmacology,"People with diabetes are 1.5 times more likely to experience stroke than those without diabetes, underlining the urgent need to address this issue. Metformin is often the initial medication chosen to manage diabetes mellitus (DM). The purpose of our systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in individuals who have received it prior to stroke.
Our study encompassed cohort studies that drew a comparison between the severity and diverse outcomes of stroke among individuals with DM who were administered metformin prior to the stroke event and those with DM who did not receive the treatment.
Ten studies met the eligibility criteria. Prestroke metformin use was associated with a significantly lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (mean difference = -1.29, 95% confidence interval: -2.11 to -0.47) in ischemic stroke. Metformin pretreatment in ischemic stroke was associated with increased odds of favorable outcome (mRS < 2) at 90 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.99), but it was not significant at discharge. Metformin was found to be associated with reduced mortality (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.64) in ischemic stroke. In hemorrhagic stroke, the results showed a significantly lower intracranial hemorrhage volume in prestroke metformin use (mean difference = -4.77, 95% CI: -6.56 to -2.98).
We found that prestroke metformin use in diabetic patients yielded neuroprotective effects. In ischemic strokes, metformin reduces stroke severity and 90-day mortality; it also improves 90-day functional outcomes. In hemorrhagic strokes, prestroke metformin use can also cause less intracranial hemorrhage volume. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and verify its benefits in stroke management.",Our study encompassed cohort studies that drew a comparison between the severity and diverse outcomes of stroke among individuals with DM who were administered metformin prior to the stroke event and those with DM who did not receive the treatment.,"Ten studies met the eligibility criteria.

40072841,Individualized Hyaluronidase-Facilitated Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin 10% Administration in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy: The Nurse's Role.,,Journal of infusion nursing : the official publication of the Infusion Nurses Society,"Hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous immunoglobulin (fSCIG) 10% offers potential improvements in patient independence and tolerability versus intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). fSCIG 10% also requires less frequent infusions and fewer infusion sites than conventional subcutaneous immunoglobulin (subcutaneous immunoglobulin without hyaluronidase). The ADVANCE-CIDP 1 study demonstrated fSCIG 10% efficacy and safety in preventing CIDP relapse and positive responses from patients in terms of satisfaction and treatment preference. Extensive guidance was provided to nurses during the conduct of ADVANCE-CIDP 1, including delivery of a ""Train the Trainer"" program by clinical trial educators to support study-site nurses. Consequently, ADVANCE-CIDP 1 has generated a valuable source of practical guidance for nurses. This review describes the key role of nursing professionals in facilitating successful transition from IVIG to subcutaneous therapy in patients with CIDP and draws on experience from ADVANCE-CIDP 1 to help equip nursing staff with the knowledge and confidence to support patients with CIDP initiating fSCIG 10% as a maintenance treatment.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40072825,Money Matters: The Effect of Income on Postsurgical Outcomes in Stage IA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Disparities, Financial toxicity, Health policy, Lung cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer, Social determinants of health",Annals of surgical oncology,"Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains challenging; 5-year survival is as low as 24% for resectable disease. However, the outlook for stage IA NSCLC is favorable, with 5-year survival exceeding 74% and with surgery often being curative. Despite this positive prognosis, low socioeconomic status has been shown to correlate with nonstandard treatment and worse overall survival specifically in stage IA. This study sought to examine income-based disparities in postsurgical survival which has yet to be discussed in the current literature.
The National Cancer Database was retrospectively queried from 2004 to 2017 to identify patients with pathological stage IA NSCLC following surgical resection; survival/patient characteristics were analyzed by income quartiles and eras (2004-2007, 2008-2012, and 2013-2017). Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariable Cox hazard modeling were used to estimate survival and construct hazard ratios, respectively.
Inclusion criteria identified 138,219 patients. Overall, a stepwise decrease in 5-year survival was observed as income quartile decreased (Q4: 72.0%; Q3: 67.8%; Q2: 66.1%; Q1: 64.2%). Hazard modeling implicated income level as an independent predictor of mortality; patients of the lowest income quartile exhibited a hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.21-1.31; p < 0.001) relative to the highest. Although overall survival increased within each income quartile over consecutive eras, income-based survival disparities continued to be observed.
Lower-income patients with stage IA NSCLC display elevated mortality risk over 5 years than higher-income patients despite receiving potentially curative surgery, with income being an independent risk-factor. This difference may also be attributed to stacked risk-factors in lower-income patients.",,"Inclusion criteria identified 138,219 patients.

40072800,Efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cell therapies in retinitis pigmentosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Mesenchymal stem cell, Meta-analysis, Retinitis pigmentosa, Stem cell therapies, Systematic review",International ophthalmology,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a retinal dystrophy and genetically heterogeneous group that causes vision loss and necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies, and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy has shown potential due to its regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSC therapies in improving visual outcomes, focusing on the impact of various MSC types, administration methods, and duration of benefits.
A systematic search of peer-reviewed studies was conducted to identify clinical trials and observational studies investigating MSC therapies for retinal conditions. Outcomes of interest included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness, retinal sensitivity, quality of life, and safety profiles. Data were synthesized and analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled effect sizes and heterogeneity.
CRD42024618158.
Eleven studies involving 355 RP patients were included. Umbilical cord-derived MSCs and bone marrow-derived MSCs demonstrated significant short-term improvements in BCVA and retinal function. Subretinal and suprachoroidal delivery methods were associated with better outcomes compared to systemic infusion. Adverse effects were minimal, with transient inflammation being the most reported. The duration of benefits varied, with most studies reporting sustained improvements up to 12 months, while long-term efficacy beyond this period was less conclusive.
MSC therapies show promise in improving visual function and retinal health, with safety profiles supporting their clinical feasibility. However, differences in administration methods and MSC types influence outcomes. Further large-scale, long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to optimize treatment protocols and validate sustained benefits.",,"Eleven studies involving 355 RP patients were included.

The duration of benefits varied, with most studies reporting sustained improvements up to 12 months, while long-term efficacy beyond this period was less conclusive.",,"© 2025.

40072785,Imbalanced sleep increases mortality risk by 14-34%: a meta-analysis.,"Clinical trials, Longevity, Meta-analysis, Mortality, Semmelweis Study, Sex difference, Survival",GeroScience,"Sleep duration is a crucial factor influencing health outcomes, yet its relationship with mortality remains debated. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the association between short and long sleep duration and all-cause mortality in adults, including sex-specific differences. A systematic search was performed in multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science, up to October 2024. Retrospective and prospective cohort studies involving adults with at least 1 year of follow-up and data on sleep duration and all-cause mortality were included. Hazard ratios were pooled using a random-effects model, with subgroup analyses performed based on sex and sleep duration categories. A total of 79 cohort studies were included, with data stratified by sex and categorized into short and long sleep durations. Short sleep duration (< 7 h per night) was associated with a 14% increase in mortality risk compared to the reference of 7-8 h, with a pooled hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.18). Conversely, long sleep duration (≥ 9 h per night) was associated with a 34% higher risk of mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.34 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.42). Sex-specific analyses indicated that both short and long sleep durations significantly elevated mortality risk in men and women, although the effect was more pronounced for long sleep duration in women. Both short and long sleep durations are associated with increased all-cause mortality, though the degree of risk varies by sex. These findings underscore the importance of considering optimal sleep duration in public health strategies aimed at enhancing longevity and highlight the need for sex-specific approaches in sleep health research.",,,,© 2025.

40072779,Psychometric validation of the Chronic Ocular Pain Questionnaire (COP-Q).,"Chronic ocular surface pain, Clinical outcome assessment, Observational, Patient-reported outcome, Psychometric validation",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,"The Chronic Ocular Pain Questionnaire (COP-Q) is a newly developed patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure intended to assess symptoms and impacts associated with Chronic Ocular Surface Pain (COSP). This study assessed the psychometric properties of the COP-Q to determine the adequacy of the COP-Q as a 'fit-for-purpose' instrument to derive trial endpoints for future clinical studies in COSP.
Patients with COSP completed the COP-Q daily for four weeks on an electronic, touch-screen, tablet device as part of a longitudinal, observational study in the United States (N = 124). Analyses were conducted to assess item properties, dimensionality and scoring, reliability and validity, and interpretation of scores. In addition, 4-hour and 24-hour recall period versions of the COP-Q Symptom Module were compared.
Item responses were distributed across the full response scale for most COP-Q items. Inter-item correlations did not identify any redundant items (r > 0.90) and all items correlated at > 0.40 in their respective module. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provided acceptable support for the unidimensional structure of the multi-item scales in the COP-Q and calculation of a total score for each module. However, CFA and Rasch analysis outlined potential redundant items for the COP-Q Visual Tasking Module (VTM), which were removed, resulting in a six-item VTM. The multi-item COP-Q modules had excellent internal consistency (α range = 0.91-0.96) and suggested fair to excellent test-retest reliability (ICC/Kappa range = 0.651-0.940) for all COP-Q modules. Construct validity for all COP-Q modules was supported by a logical pattern of correlations with concurrent measures and evidence of ability to distinguish between known-groups, with statistically significant differences between COSP severity groups. Paired t-tests, coefficient of determination (CoD) and concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) showed statistically significant differences between the two recall period versions of the Symptom Module, although the magnitude of the difference was small, and each version shares a high level of reproducibility in scores.
Findings provide evidence that the COP-Q is a valid and reliable measure of patient-reported COSP symptoms and impacts for use in future clinical trials in COSP. Both 4-hour and 24-hour Symptom Module recall period versions are likely to yield consistent results and are equally robust.",,"Item responses were distributed across the full response scale for most COP-Q items.

40072631,Protective role of calcium-based agents in dental bleaching gels: insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical and laboratory evidence.,"Calcium, Carbamide peroxide, Dentin desensitizing agents, Hydrogen peroxide, Tooth bleaching",Clinical oral investigations,"This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) evaluated the effect of incorporating calcium-based bioactive agents in bleaching gels on dental structure preservation and whitening efficacy.
A comprehensive search was conducted across databases up to November 2024. Two independent reviewers screened and selected clinical trials and in vitro studies evaluating the effects of calcium-based bioactive agents in bleaching gels, following predefined PICO criteria. Data extraction and quality assessments were performed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Meta-analyses were conducted with RevMan software, using the mean difference as the effect measure.
Out of 4,289 articles identified, 56 met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 50 in vitro studies and 6 clinical trials. The agents evaluated included calcium ions, calcium gluconate, amorphous calcium phosphate, CPP-ACP, and calcium polyphosphate. Overall, all agents reduced the adverse effects associated with bleaching therapy, such as minimizing changes in the mechanical and morphological properties of enamel, reducing transamelodentinal diffusion, and clinically decreasing tooth sensitivity. None of the calcium-based agents interfered with the bleaching effect. In short, the studies demonstrated a low risk of bias.
Calcium-based agents incorporated into bleaching gels reduced bleaching-induced changes in dental tissues and demonstrated clinical aesthetic results comparable to conventional gels. However, further clinical trials are needed to optimize formulations, application protocols, and confirm the findings of this study.
This SRM provides evidence that these agents offer additional benefits by enhancing the biocompatibility and safety of whitening therapy over conventional treatments, guiding clinicians in material selection for whitening procedures.",,"Out of 4,289 articles identified, 56 met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 50 in vitro studies and 6 clinical trials.

40072625,Heart rate variability biofeedback in patients with functional dizziness.,"Depression, HRV, PPPD, Parasympathetic, RMSSD",Journal of neurology,"Functional dizziness is one of the most common causes of chronic dizziness. Associated psychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety lead to significant impairment, possibly due to autonomic nervous system imbalance. We investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback can modulate autonomic function in patients with functional dizziness.
We performed a randomized controlled study in 24 patients diagnosed functional dizziness for the first time. Patients received six 20 min sessions of HRV biofeedback or no intervention. We assessed HRV (time and frequency domains), sympathetic vasomotor function, sympathetic skin response and psychometric assessments at baseline, immediately post-intervention (or control period) and another 3 and 6 weeks later.
Patients in the HRV biofeedback group showed improved cardiac autonomic function with elevated HRV time-dependent parameters immediately post-intervention [Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD): 71.2 ms ± 38 ms vs. 38.2 ms ± 18.5 ms, p = 0.014; Standard Deviation of all NN Intervals (SDNN): 78.3 ms ± 35.9 ms vs. 48.1 ms ± 20.5 ms, p = 0.001], increased HRV frequency-dependent parameter [Low Frequency (LF): p = 0.001], as well as reduced depressiveness (BDI-II: p = 0.0236). None of these parameters were changed in control patients (p = ns). Dizziness-associated symptoms and sympathetic function of vasculature and sweat glands were unaltered in both study arms.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the CROSS technique using 70% and 100% TCA.
A total of 40 patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups of 20: the first group received 70% TCA, while the second group was treated with 100% TCA. Both patient-reported outcomes and researcher assessments were utilized to evaluate treatment success. The intensity of the burning sensation experienced during the procedure was quantified, and the duration of the frosted appearance was recorded.
The mean age of participants was 27.07 ± 5.48 years in the 70% TCA group and 23.5 ± 2.9 years in the 100% TCA group. No significant differences were observed between post-treatment scores provided by patients and researchers. However, within the 100% TCA group, treatment efficacy was significantly greater for icepick scars than for boxcar scars. Additionally, crusting durations were significantly prolonged in the 100% TCA group.

A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Chorioamnionitis, Docosahexaenoic acid, Mode of delivery, Preeclampsia, Small-for-gestational age",European journal of pediatrics,"To explore whether prenatal conditions (i.e. chorioamnionitis, preeclampsia or small-for-gestational age (SGA)) affect the very preterm infant's response to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), according to mode of delivery, an independent factor shown to modulate this association. Secondary exploratory analysis of the MOBYDIck randomized controlled trial (NCT02371460) evaluating the effect of a neonatal high-dose DHA supplementation through maternal breastmilk compared to placebo. Population was preterm infants born before 29 weeks of gestation in sixteen Canadian neonatal intensive care units. Primary outcome was physiological BPD based on pulse oximetry assessment. Secondary outcomes included ""death or BPD""; ""moderate-or-severe"" BPD; severe BPD; death from any causes. Heterogeneity in the effect of DHA on outcomes was assessed by prenatal conditions and mode of delivery using generalized estimating equation logistic regression models. The trial intended to enroll 800 mothers but was stopped early for safety, likely making subgroup analysis underpowered. 230 mothers (271 infants) were included in DHA group and 226 mothers (252 infants) in placebo group. The association between high-dose DHA and BPD differed by chorioamnionitis status (heterogeneity P=0.04). In infants exposed to chorioamnionitis and vaginal delivery, DHA supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of physiological BPD (adjusted odds ratio, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.62], P=0.007). No heterogeneity was found by maternal preeclampsia (heterogeneity P=0.44) nor SGA status (heterogeneity P=0.17).
This secondary analysis generated hypotheses for a potential differential effect of neonatal enteral high-dose DHA supplementation on BPD in very preterm infants according to chorioamnionitis exposure.
• The MOBYDIck trial reported a potential protective effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infants born vaginally, but not in those born via cesarean section. • Placenta pathologies are associated with inflammation in the infants and could affect the very preterm infant's response to a high-dose DHA supplementation on BPD according to the mode of delivery.
• This study suggests that, in infants born very preterm before 29 weeks of gestation, the association between enteral high-dose DHA supplementation in neonatal period and BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age differ according to the maternal status for chorioamnionitis at delivery.",,,This secondary analysis generated hypotheses for a potential differential effect of neonatal enteral high-dose DHA supplementation on BPD in very preterm infants according to chorioamnionitis exposure.,"© 2025.

40072601,Mulberry leaf extract combined with tryptophan improves sleep and post wake mood in adults with sleep complaints - A randomized cross-over study.,"Actigraphy, Continuous glucose monitoring, Mulberry leaf extract, Nocturnal glycemia, Sleep quality, Tryptophan",European journal of nutrition,"In the current study we evaluated a blend of ingredients containing mulberry leaf extract (to lower postprandial glucose of the evening meal), tryptophan (facilitator of the sleep initiation) to benefit sleep initiation and quality in adults with self-reported difficulties with sleep initiation.
Forty-three adults aged between 25 and 50 years enrolled in a randomized, crossover, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants received standardized meals with a glycemic load of 55 ± 10% and were assigned to receive treatment comprising a combination of mulberry leaf extract (750 mg), whey protein containing 120 mg tryptophan, zinc (1.35 mg), magnesium (12.6 mg), vitamin B3 (1.93 mg) and B6 (0.135 mg) and control (4 g wheat protein hydrolysate). Each intervention phase lasted 14 days separated by a washout period of 28 days. The primary outcomes were actigraphy-measured sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency. Secondary outcomes included continuous glycemic responses, mood, and cognition.
A linear mixed model intention-to-treat analysis conducted on 42 participants found that the treatment reduced sleep onset latency (actigraphy: -3.82 mins, p = 0.026; self-report: -3.09 mins, p = 0.048). Treatment significantly reduced evening meal's postprandial glucose response (incremental area under the curve, mmol/L*min) at 1 hour by 21% (p < 0.001), incremental maximum concentration by 16% (p = < 0.001) and nocturnal glucose variation over the 14-day period. Participants on treatment reported improved sleep quality (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, -0.17, p = 0.041) and feeling more relaxed (Brief Mood Introspection Scale, -0.4, p = 0.003) the next morning compared to when taking the control. Additionally, the treatment improved the vigor dimension on the Profile of Mood Scale (0.8, p = 0.038). No effects were observed on the cognitive performance. Lowering postprandial glucose significantly mediated the treatment effect of lowering sleep onset latency and lower nocturnal glucose variation was also associated with improved sleep quality and next-day positive mood.
The evening meal supplement benefited sleep initiation and quality, and also improved post wake mood in adults.

40072552,Harnessing bee venom for inflammatory diseases management: from traditional medicine to nanotechnology.,"Acupuncture, Anti-inflammation, Apitherapy, Bee venom, Bee venom therapy, Nanoemulsions, Nanofibers, Nanoparticles",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,"This review investigates the anti-inflammatory potential of bee venom, a natural compound comprising peptides, enzymes, biogenic amines other bioactive amines, and other bioactive components. It aims to elucidate how bee venom mitigates inflammatory responses caused by tissue injury, infections, and trauma. This study also explores the advancements in nanotechnology to enhance bee venom's therapeutic effects. A systematic review of studies from Google Scholar and PubMed, up to 2025, was conducted. Both in vitro and in vivo research focusing on bee venom's effects on proinflammatory mediators were analyzed. Specific attention was given to its molecular mechanisms, therapeutic impact on inflammatory conditions, and the role of nanotechnology in improving drug delivery and stability. Bee venom and its components, including melittin, apamin, and phospholipase A2 demonstrate robust anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting key proinflammatory mediators. These effects have been observed in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and skin disorders. Studies show bee venom's capacity to reduce excessive inflammatory responses effectively. Moreover, incorporating nanotechnology significantly enhances its therapeutic benefits by improving delivery, stability, and bioavailability, paving the way for advanced applications. Bee venom offers a natural, powerful approach to combating the inflammation and related chromic disorders. Its ability to regulate inflammatory pathways is promising for therapeutic use. The integration of nanotechnology further amplifies its potential, providing innovative solutions for efficient and targeted treatments. This study also highlights the need for more clinical trials to establish bee venom as a mainstream therapeutic agent in modern medicine.",,,,"© 2025.

40072512,"Gastric Cancer Screening in the United States: A Review of Current Evidence, Challenges, and Future Perspectives.",,The American journal of gastroenterology,"Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In the United States, gastric cancer incidence and mortality are substantially higher among non-White racial and ethnic groups and new immigrants from high-incidence countries. This is in large part related to the higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric premalignant changes in these populations. Apart from primary prevention, early detection of gastric cancer is the principal strategy to reduce gastric cancer mortality and improve survival. Extensive evidence in Asian countries has demonstrated the benefits of endoscopic screening in detecting early-stage gastric cancer and reducing gastric cancer-related mortality. By contrast, direct, high-quality US-based data, such as from large clinical trials or observational studies, on important outcomes of gastric cancer screening are still lacking. In this review, we evaluate and summarize the latest global evidence on the epidemiology and predisposing factors of gastric cancer as well as the efficacy, benefits vs. risks, and cost-effectiveness of gastric cancer screening. We further discuss the critical knowledge gaps and challenges in promoting gastric cancer screening in the United States.

40072447,"Expectancy Effects, Failure of Blinding Integrity, and Placebo Response in Trials of Treatments for Psychiatric Disorders: A Narrative Review.",,JAMA psychiatry,"Expectancy effects are significant confounding factors in psychiatric randomized clinical trials (RCTs), potentially affecting the interpretation of study results. This narrative review is the first, to our knowledge, to explore the relationship between expectancy effects, compromised blinding integrity, and the effects of active treatment/placebo in psychiatric RCTs. Additionally, we present statistical and experimental approaches that may help mitigate the confounding impact of expectancy effects. The review concludes with recommendations to enhance the reliability of RCTs in psychiatry.
The placebo response comprises both specific and nonspecific elements, with expectation being a key specific component. Evidence from experimental and clinical studies suggests that expectancy can influence treatment responses in RCTs. Blinding integrity may be compromised by perceived treatment efficacy and adverse effects, introducing bias into outcome assessments. Treatment expectations can lead to unblinding during RCTs, and meta-analytic data from studies in the fields of psychedelics and anxiety disorders indicate that this can influence effect sizes. Therefore, controlling for expectancy effects is essential when interpreting RCT results. Novel statistical methods, though still in need of further validation, offer strategies to address this issue. Another approach may involve experimental medicine models, which aim to develop objective improvement markers (readouts) less affected by expectancy effects.

40072445,A Novel Model for Cornea Power Shift in Eyes Wearing Orthokeratology Lenses With Different Back Optic Zone Diameters for Myopia Control.,,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,"The purpose of this study was to quantify the corneal power changes after wearing orthokeratology lenses of different back optic zone diameters (BOZDs) and to propose a novel 4-parameter model capable of revealing the associations between each parameter and axial length growth (ALG).
A prospective self-controlled study was conducted between June 2022 and December 2023. One eye in each subject (N = 33) was randomly assigned to wear a lens with a BOZD of either 5 mm (5 oz) or 6 mm (6 oz). Axial lengths were measured at 6 and 12 months and ALG was calculated from those measurements. Corneal topography obtained at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after lens-wearing was analyzed, and the central flatten region is considered as the treatment zone (TZ). The power change profile was fitted with a riverbank model with parameters describing the amplitude, location shift, slope, and base. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the association between ALG and model parameters.
ALG was significantly slower in eyes wearing 5 oz lenses (0.19 ± 0.15 vs. 0.26 ± 0.15 mm, P < 0.01). TZ sizes were smaller in the 5 oz group (6.76 ± 2.21 vs. 8.07 ± 2.01 mm2, P < 0.01). For relative corneal refractive powers shift (RCRPS) profiles averaged across 360 degrees, greater amplitudes (4.70 ± 1.05 vs. 4.33 ± 0.99 diopter [D], P = 0.04) and smaller location shifts (1.97 ± 0.32 vs. 2.11 ± 0.27 mm, P < 0.01) were found in the 5 oz group. For RCRPS profiles calculated in eight different meridians, strong meridional modulations were found in the parameters in each group. Moreover, significant inter-group parameter differences (P < 0.01) were only found on the temporal side. Multiple regression showed that only location shift was significantly associated with ALG (P = 0.01).

40072437,Exercise and Psychosexual Education to Improve Sexual Function in Men With Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,,JAMA network open,"Sexual dysfunction is a common adverse effect of prostate cancer treatment, and current management strategies do not adequately address physical and psychological causes. Exercise is a potential therapy in the management of sexual dysfunction.
To investigate the effects of supervised, clinic-based, resistance and aerobic exercise with and without a brief psychosexual education and self-management intervention (PESM) on sexual function in men with prostate cancer compared with usual care.
A 3-arm, parallel-group, single-center randomized clinical trial was undertaken at university-affiliated exercise clinics between July 24, 2014, and August 22, 2019. Eligible participants were men with prostate cancer who had previously undergone or were currently undergoing treatment and were concerned about sexual dysfunction. Data analysis was undertaken October 8 to December 23, 2024.
Participants were randomized to (1) 6 months of supervised, group-based resistance and aerobic exercise (n = 39 [34.8%]), (2) the same exercise program plus PESM (n = 36 [32.1%]), or (3) usual care (n = 37 [33.0%]). Exercise was to be undertaken 3 days per week.
The primary outcome was sexual function assessed with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Secondary outcomes included body composition, physical function, and muscle strength. Analyses were undertaken using an intention-to-treat approach.
In total, 112 participants (mean [SD] age, 66.3 [7.1] years) were randomized. Mean adjusted difference in IIEF score at 6 months favored exercise compared with usual care (3.5; 95% CI, 0.3-6.6; P = .04). The mean adjusted difference for intercourse satisfaction was not significant (1.7; 95% CI, 0.1-3.2; P = .05). PESM did not result in additional improvements. Compared with usual care, exercise also significantly improved fat mass (mean adjusted difference, -0.9 kg; 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.1 kg; P = .02), chair rise performance (mean adjusted difference, -1.8 seconds; 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.5 seconds; P = .002), and upper (mean adjusted difference, 9.4 kg; 95% CI, 6.9-11.9 kg; P < .001) and lower (mean adjusted difference, 17.9 kg; 95% CI, 7.6-28.2 kg; P < .001) body muscle strength.
In this randomized clinical trial of supervised exercise, erectile function in patients with prostate cancer was improved. PESM resulted in no additional improvements. Patients with prostate cancer should be offered exercise following treatment as a potential rehabilitation measure.

40072429,Estimation and Hypothesis Testing of Strain-Specific Vaccine Efficacy With Missing Strain Types With Application to a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial.,"COVID‐19 vaccine efficacy trial, augmented inverse probability weighted complete‐case estimation, competing risks model, missing failure cause, stratified Cox proportional hazards model",Statistics in medicine,"Based on data from a randomized, controlled vaccine efficacy trial, this article develops statistical methods for assessing vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent COVID-19 infections by a discrete set of genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2. Strain-specific VE adjusting for possibly time-varying covariates is estimated using augmented inverse probability weighting to address missing viral genotypes under a competing risks model that allows separate baseline hazards for different risk groups. Hypothesis tests are developed to assess whether the vaccine provides at least a specified level of VE against some viral genotypes and whether VE varies across genotypes. Asymptotic properties providing analytic inferences are derived and finite-sample properties of the estimators and hypothesis tests are studied through simulations. This research is motivated by the fact that previous analyses of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy did not account for missing genotypes, which can cause severe bias and efficiency loss. The theoretical properties and simulations demonstrate superior performance of the new methods. Application to the Moderna COVE trial identifies several SARS-CoV-2 genotype features with differential vaccine efficacy across genotypes, including lineage (Reference, Epsilon, Gamma, Zeta), indicators of residue match vs. mismatch to the vaccine-strain residue at Spike amino acid positions (identifying signatures of differential VE), and a weighted Hamming distance to the vaccine strain. The results show VE decreases against genotypes more distant from the vaccine strain, highlighting the need to update COVID-19 vaccine strains.",,,,© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1002/sim.10345,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Heng', 'firstname': 'Fei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of North Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yanqing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease and Public Health Sciences Divisions, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'B Gilbert', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease and Public Health Sciences Divisions, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}"
40072371,Gut Microbiota Modulation of Dementia Related Complications.,,Aging and disease,"Recent advances in microbial pathogen research have highlighted the potential of gut microbe-based microbial medicine. One of the most extensively studied biological pathways is the gut-brain axis, which has been shown to reverse neurological disorders. Evidence from animal-based studies of dysbiosis suggest complex behavioral changes, such as alterations in sociability and anxiety, can be modulated through gut microbiota. Specifically, mental disorders include major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Gastrointestinal diseases can be reversed by modulating gut microbiota. Dementia and its related mechanisms are also amenable to modulation of the gut microbiota. This review focuses on the role of gut microbiota in dementia by discussing the effects on depressive symptoms, cognitive function, mood, behavioral changes, chronic stress, and the prospects of the microbiota-gut-brain axis for dementia. Although animal models have revealed promising approaches for treating dementia through the modulation of the gut microbiota, it may be premature to incorporate these interventions into standard clinical practice. The heterogeneity of findings from clinical trials and randomized control trials has yet to convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of modulation in reversing dementia and its related complications.",,,,,10.14336/AD.2025.0108,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Xiaoqing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'First Clinical Medical College, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin 150040, China.\nThe Fifth Department of Acupuncture, First Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150040, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yinghua', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'The Fifth Department of Acupuncture, First Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150040, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuan', 'firstname': 'Xingxing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'First Clinical Medical College, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Harbin 150040, China.\nDepartment of Internal medicine, Heilongjiang Academy of traditional Chinese Medicine, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, China.'}"

We previously demonstrated that IL-24 leads to apoptosis in cancer cells through protein kinase A (PKA) activation in human breast cancer cells. To better understand the mechanism by which IL-24 induces apoptosis, we analyzed the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase in cancer cells and a downstream target of PKA. Our studies show for the first time that GSK3β is inhibited following IL-24 treatment in human prostate cancer cells. We showed that the inhibition of GSK3β is mediated through PKA activation triggered by IL-24. IL-24 decreases the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, substantially activating glycogen synthase and decreasing intracellular glucose levels. Notably, the expression of a constitutively active form of GSK3β abolishes the effect of IL-24. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of IL-24 in apoptosis mediated through GSK3β regulation and its possible implications for metabolic stress, mitochondria dysfunction, and apoptosis. Future studies should precisely delineate the most effective combinations of IL-24 as a GSK3β inhibitor with cytotoxic agents for prostate and other cancers.

40072044,Continuous R-DA-EDOCH alternated with high-dose Ara-C induces deep remission and overcomes high-risk factors in young patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.,"Mantle cell lymphoma, adverse events, high-risk factors, immunochemotherapy, minimal residual disease",Cancer biology & medicine,"Our previous studies have indicated potentially higher proliferative activity of tumor cells in Chinese patients with mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) than those in Western. Given the success and tolerability of R-DA-EDOCH immunochemotherapy in treating aggressive B-cell lymphomas, we designed a prospective, phase 3 trial to explore the efficacy and safety of alternating R-DA-EDOCH/R-DHAP induction therapy for young patients with newly diagnosed MCL. The primary endpoint was the complete remission rate (CRR) at the end of induction (EOI).
A total of 55 patients were enrolled. The CRR at the EOI was 89.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 78%-96%], and the overall response rate was 98.1% (95% CI 90%-100%). Most patients with bone marrow involvement quickly attained minimal residual disease (MRD) negative status, with a 95.7% rate at the EOI.
The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival rates were 66.3% and 83.2%, respectively. No patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Univariate analysis identified pathologic morphology and TP53 mutations as risk factors for PFS. However, high tumor proliferative activity and certain cytogenetic abnormalities showed no significant adverse prognostic significance.

A literature review was conducted using the search terms 
All relevant clinical trials, review articles, package inserts, and guidelines evaluating clinically relevant evidence regarding the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 agonists in MASLD were considered for inclusion.
GLP-1 RAs have shown promising results in MASLD treatment. Semaglutide has demonstrated efficacy in reducing liver fat content, inflammation, and fibrosis, with clinical trials indicating improvements in hepatic biomarkers and cardiometabolic risk factors. Similarly, tirzepatide has been associated with substantial weight loss and significant reductions in liver fat and fibrosis markers. Both agents exert their effects through mechanisms involving improved insulin sensitivity, reduced lipid accumulation, and attenuation of hepatic inflammation.
Given the high prevalence of MASLD in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide and semaglutide could play a critical role in clinical practice by addressing multiple facets of the disease. Both agents have shown potential in reducing liver fat, improving hepatic biomarkers, and mitigating cardiometabolic risks, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in MASLD patients. Incorporating these therapies into MASLD treatment guidelines could significantly enhance patient outcomes by targeting both liver-related and systemic complications of the disease.

However, they often display poor participant retention. To prevent this, various participant interventions have been identified and evaluated through the use of studies within a trial. Two such interventions are participant short message service reminders (also known as text-messages) and personalised participant short message service reminders, designed to encourage a participant to return a study questionnaire. While previous studies within a trial have evaluated the effectiveness of these two retention strategies, trialists continue to spend both time and money on these strategies while the evidence remains inconclusive.
This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the use of short message service reminders with no short message service reminder and personalised short message service reminders with non-personalised short message service reminders, on participant retention. Eligible studies were identified through advanced searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) and hand-searching of alternative information sources. The review primary outcome was the proportion of study questionnaires returned for the individual study within a trial primary analysis time points.
Nine eligible studies within a trial were identified, of which four compared short message service versus no short message service and five compared personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service. For those that compared personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service, only three were deemed appropriate for meta-analysis. The primary outcome results for short message service versus no short message service concluded that short message service led to a statistically non-significant increase in the odds of study questionnaire return by 9% (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.92 to 1.30). Similarly, comparison of personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service concluded that personalised short message service caused a statistically non-significant increase in odds by 22% (odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 0.95 to 1.59).
The effectiveness of both short message service and personalised short message service as retention tools remains inconclusive and further study within a trial evaluations are required. However, as short message services are low in cost, easy to use and generally well accepted by participants, it is suggested that trialists adopt a pragmatic approach and utilise these reminders until further research is conducted. Given both the minimal addition in cost for studies already utilising short message service reminders and some evidence of effect, personalisation should also be considered.",,"Nine eligible studies within a trial were identified, of which four compared short message service versus no short message service and five compared personalised short message service versus non-personalised short message service.

40071965,Regional anesthesia for arrhythmias: a review of current literature.,,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,"The aim is to provide a comprehensive review of regional anesthesia techniques to control ventricular arrhythmias.
While promising, the use of stellate ganglion block (SGB) for arrhythmia control is still under investigation, and further clinical trials are warranted to fully understand its efficacy, long-term outcomes, suitable patient group, and safety profile. Nevertheless, it remains a potential adjunctive therapy in the management of ventricular arrhythmias in select patients. Continuous stellate ganglion block (C-SGB) offers an alternative to single-shot SGB and thoracic epidural anesthesia for effective management in the reduction of ventricular arrhythmias until definitive treatment; it is safe and may reduce the need to repeat the single-shot block.
SGB has been described in the literature as a successful adjunct therapy to reduce arrhythmia load. Blocking the stellate ganglion can provide transient sympathetic blockade for controlling refractory ventricular arrhythmias, otherwise uncontrolled with medication management. By regulating the sympathetic nervous system, the stellate ganglion affects the electrical conductance of the heart, and thus inhibition of the ganglion can modulate the autonomic balance with subsequent reduction in ventricular arrhythmias. These studies until 2017 were limited to case reports and case series; meta-analysis by Fudim et al. supports the use of left-sided SGB to manage ventricular arrhythmias. Recent clinical trials further strengthen the findings and favor the trend of catheter use for continuous SGB. Further studies are warranted to identify suitable patient groups and when to initiate SBG or C-SGB.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Biometrische Zeitschrift,"Borrowing external controls to augment the concurrent control arm is a popular topic in clinical trials. Bayesian dynamic borrowing methods adaptively discount external controls according to prior-data conflict. For the Gaussian endpoint, parameter-specific information borrowing enables differential discounting between the population mean and variance. The borrowing-by-part power prior employs two power parameters to separately downweight external likelihoods concerning the sample mean and variance. However, within the fully Bayesian framework, the posterior inference of the average treatment effect (ATE) defined as the population mean difference is significantly affected by the variance-specific prior-data conflict that reflects the heterogeneity of population variance. Here, we propose the modified conditional borrowing-by-part power prior (MCBPP) that separately discounts the external sample mean and variance according to parameter-specific prior-data conflicts, resulting in a more stable posterior estimation of ATE than its competitors under the same degree of mean-specific prior-data conflict. By fully discounting the external sample variance, the robust MCBPP (rMCBPP) can yield robust posterior inference of ATE against the variance-specific prior-data conflict. Although the population variance is considered a nuisance parameter, its homogeneity is equally important to justify information borrowing. We recommend the rMCBPP for borrowing external controls with a similar sample variance to concurrent controls because it exhibits better control of bias and Type I error rate than the modified power prior (MPP) assuming unknown variance in the absence of population variance heterogeneity. However, when faced with a significant sample variance discrepancy, the MPP assuming unknown variance is preferred given its better performance under severe population variance heterogeneity.",,,,© 2025 Wiley‐VCH GmbH.,10.1002/bimj.70029,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Kai', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Peking University Clinical Research Institute, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Han', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.\nMedical Data Science Center, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, School of Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yao', 'firstname': 'Chen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Peking University Clinical Research Institute, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.'}"

Biometrische Zeitschrift,"N-of-1 trials are currently receiving broader attention in healthcare research when assessing the effectiveness of interventions. In contrast to the most commonly applied two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), in an N-of-1 design, the individual acts as their own control condition in the sense of a multiple crossover trial. N-of-1 trials can lead to a higher quality of patient by examining the effectiveness of an intervention at an individual level. Moreover, when a series of N-of-1 trials are properly aggregated, it becomes possible to detect an intervention effect at a population level. This work investigates whether a meta-analysis of summary data of a series of N-of-1 trials allows us to detect a statistically significant intervention effect with fewer participants than in a traditional, prospectively powered two-arm RCT and crossover design when evaluating a digital health intervention in cardiovascular care. After introducing these different analysis approaches, we compared the empirical properties in a simulation study both under the null hypothesis and with respect to power with different between-subject heterogeneity settings and in the presence of a carry-over effect. We further investigate the performance of a sequential aggregation procedure. In terms of simulated power, the threshold of 80% was achieved earlier for the aggregating procedure, requiring fewer participants.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

A PubMed (January 1, 1985 to January 27, 2025) literature search was performed using the terms seladelpar, MBX-8025, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, and PBC. Other data sources included Google Scholar and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry.
All English-language literature evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of seladelpar in the treatment of PBC was reviewed.
Seladelpar is the first PPARδ agonist in the treatment of PBC that has shown a significant reduction across biochemical response, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) normalization, and pruritus as compared to placebo while demonstrating safety and tolerability.Relevance to patient care and clinical practice in comparison to existing drugs:While existing drug treatments for PBC are efficacious, there remains an unmet need due to an incomplete biochemical response in many patients. Patients frequently suffer from symptoms, including pruritus, impacting their quality of life. Seladelpar could have a beneficial role in PBC as add-on therapy in improving biochemical response as well as alleviating pruritus.

This study examined the interplay between watching television and T2D genetic risk for risk of ASCVD.
We included 346 916 White British individuals from UK Biobank. A weighted polygenic risk score for T2D was calculated on the basis of 138 genetic variants associated with T2D. Time spent watching television was self-reported and categorized into 2 groups: ≤1 h/d and ≥2 h/d. Over a median 13.8-year follow-up, 21 265 incident ASCVD events were identified. Models using Cox regression with age as the underlying time scale adjusted for potential confounders (demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle factors, and medication use) were fit.
Compared with watching television for ≤1 h/d, watching ≥2 h/d was associated with 12% (95% CI, 1.07-1.16) higher hazards of ASCVD, independently of T2D genetic risk.

Recapitulating developmental patterning cues, such as fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), secreted at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), is critical for the in vitro production of authentic VM DA progenitors. Here, we explored the application of alternative MHB-secreted FGF-family members, FGF17 and FGF18, for VM DA progenitor patterning. We show that while FGF17 and FGF18 both recapitulated VM DA progenitor patterning events, FGF17 induced expression of key VM DA progenitor markers at higher levels than FGF8 and transplanted FGF17-patterned progenitors fully reversed motor deficits in a rat PD model. Early activation of the cAMP pathway mimicked FGF17-induced patterning, although strong cAMP activation came at the expense of EN1 expression. In summary, we identified FGF17 as a promising alternative FGF candidate for robust VM DA progenitor patterning.",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.

To reduce and prevent hyperpigmentation, numerous skin lightening agents have been developed. Potassium 4-methoxysalicylate (4MSK) is a skin lightening agent that was approved as an active skin lightening ingredient of quasi-drugs by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan in 2003. For over 20 years, 4MSK has been widely used in quasi-drug and cosmetic products. However, the mechanism of action and efficacy of 4MSK on skin pigmentation and skin lightness have not been publicly reported.
This study aimed to assess the mechanism of action and the efficacy of 4MSK on facial pigmentation.
The mechanism of action of 4MSK on epidermal cells was investigated using human melanocytes, human keratinocytes, and human 3D epidermal equivalents. The efficacy of 4MSK on facial pigmentation was evaluated by a human clinical study, which is a double-blind, split-face, placebo-controlled, paired-design study.
4MSK significantly suppressed melanin content in cultured human melanocytes and a 3D epidermal equivalent. It also promoted gene expression of differentiation markers of human keratinocytes. In the clinical study, a 4MSK formulation significantly increased skin lightness values in both pigmented and non-pigmented areas of cheek skin. In addition, it reduced the desquamation area ratio of the cheek.

Since its discovery nearly two decades ago, our understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical manifestations has grown substantially. Early diagnosis and treatment of this elusive disease can prevent substantial organ damage from end-stage fibrosis. This underscores the importance of prompt recognition, full characterization, and astute management. The American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria provide a framework for approaching the diagnosis of IgG4-RD even though they were not intended for diagnostic purposes. The approach to diagnosis involves recognizing the typical disease manifestations and incorporating clinical, radiological, serological, and histopathological information. The exclusion of disease mimickers, particularly malignancy and other inflammatory conditions, is essential. Both glucocorticoids and B cell depletion are effective at inducing remission in IgG4-RD in most patients.

40071356,Effects of Mindfulness Therapy on Breast Cancer Patients with Depression or Anxiety: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,,Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignant tumor threatening women's health globally, with rising incidence rates and significant psychological impacts, particularly in China, where the prevalence of depressive and anxious mood disorders among BC patients is notably higher than the global average. To evaluate the effect of mindfulness therapy on anxiety and depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients, as psychological distress significantly affects their quality of life and often persists despite medical treatment.
A computerized search of Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials involving the effects of positive thinking interventions on anxiety and depressive symptoms in breast cancer patients. The search was conducted from the time of database construction to December 2023. Two researchers completed literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, and then analyzed using RevMan 5.4 software.
A total of 15 studies involving 1823 patients were included. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that anxiety scores [mean difference (MD) = -0.67, 95% CI (-1.05, -0.29), p = 0.0005] and depression scores [MD = -2.26, 95% CI (-2.91, -1.61), p < 0.00001] were lower in the positive mindfulness intervention group than in the control group after the intervention, and the difference was statistically significant. Meanwhile, the follow-up time (>8 weeks vs ≤8 weeks) had little effect on the improvement of patients' depression and anxiety scores. The distribution of studies was unsymmetrical, and there was a certain degree of publication bias.
This study provides scientific evidence and practical guidance for psychological care in breast cancer patients, supporting the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (excluding mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)) in alleviating anxiety and depression. Future research should focus on high-quality randomized controlled trials to confirm and expand these findings and explore more effective intervention strategies.",,"A total of 15 studies involving 1823 patients were included.

Current asthma management lacks real-time, objective, and longitudinal monitoring reflected by a high prevalence of uncontrolled asthma. Long-term home monitoring promises to establish new clinical endpoints for timely anticipation. In addition, integrating eHealth interventions holds promise for timely and appropriate medical anticipation for controlling symptoms and preventing asthma exacerbations.
This study aims to provide a pragmatic study design for gaining insight into longitudinal monitoring, assessing, and comparing eHealth interventions' short- and long-term effects on improving pediatric asthma care.
The CIRCUS study design is a cohort multiple randomized controlled trial (cmRCT) with a dynamic cohort of 300 pediatric asthma patients.
The study gathers observational and patient-reported measurements at set moments including patient characteristics, healthcare utilization, and asthma, clinical, and environmental outcomes. Participants are randomly appointed to the intervention or control group. The effects of the eHealth interventions are assessed and compared to the control group, deploying the CIRCUS outcomes. The participants continue in the CIRCUS cohort after completing the intervention and its follow-up.
This study was ethically approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (NL85668.100.23) on February 15th, 2024.
The CIRCUS study can provide a rich and unique dataset that can improve insight into risk factors of asthma exacerbations and yield new clinical endpoints. Furthermore, the effects of eHealth interventions can be assessed and compared with each other both short- and long-term. In addition, patient groups within the patient population can be discerned to tailor eHealth interventions to personalized needs on improving asthma management.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this intervention on longer-term outcomes.
Patients were followed up in the TRACE RCT to 1 year in nine hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery, and at risk for adverse postoperative outcome, were included. Patients in the intervention group additionally received routine anaesthesia visits on postoperative days 1 and 3. Clinical outcome measures included 1-year mortality, hospital readmission, and reoperation. Functional recovery (FR) was measured using the patient-reported global surgical recovery (GSR) index, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and functional recovery index (FRI). Quality of life (QoL) was measured using EQ-5D-5L.
Some 5473 adult patients were followed up. No differences were found between the control and intervention groups for clinical, FR, and QoL outcome measures. One-year mortality was 5.4% in the control group and 5.8% in the intervention group, readmission was 27% and 26% respectively, and reoperation was 20% and 18% respectively. At 1 year, FR and QoL had recovered to preoperative levels. However, 30% of patients were not able to fully perform ADL and 40%-51% of patients still reported a problem in the EQ-5D-5L dimensions mobility, usual activities, and pain/discomfort.
Routine postoperative anaesthesia ward visits of patients did not improve clinical, functional, and QoL outcomes.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) could play a critical role in the identification and referral of patients suspected of AD to specialty care. A multidisciplinary AD Biomarker Task Force was convened to evaluate current biomarker use cases, define an optimal biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway, and understand factors impacting adoption. The Task Force identified opportunities to support biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway adoption, including streamlining risk assessment and screening by leveraging digital tools, activating primary care providers through education, generating data to expand applicability to diverse populations, and advocating for aligned policies and quality measures.

A significant number of potential medicines have not progressed to clinical trials because preclinical models inadequately replicate the complexities of the varied tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the variety of breast cancer models is extensive, and the selection of a model frequently depends on the specific inquiry presented. This review aims to present an overview of the existing breast cancer models, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and challenges in the context of innovative drug discovery, thereby offering insights that may be advantageous to future translational studies. Conventional monolayer cultures are critical for elucidating the different breast cancer types and their behavior, have limitations in adequately replicating tumor environments. The 3D models such as patient-derived xenografts, cell-derived xenografts and genetically engineered models offer better insights by maintaining tumor microenvironments and cellular heterogeneity.

40070923,"Data altruism and the ""consent"" question: a study into the ""consent"" models used under the GDPR and how the data altruism mechanism can act as a potential solution for the research community in the reuse of health data.","GDPR, consent, data altruism, data governance act, data sharing, health data, secondary use of data",Frontiers in medicine,"The General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") legal basis for obtaining consent for the processing of personal data for research purposes, where those purposes cannot be fully specified in advance, is provided for in Articles 6, 7 and Recital 33. However, GDPR's requirements for obtaining consent, as to the secondary use and sharing of data in research, have been argued to have generated confusion, whilst the conflicts between the Regulation itself, its practical application and research ethics are well-documented (1). The requirements for ""informed consent"", as defined within the GDPR, have not been well defined in the context of genome research or clinical trials (2), which has in turn led to the implementation and interpretation of the lawful basis to span into different idiosyncratic models. This naturally has fed into the uncertainty of how the legal basis can be applied in practice and calls for an investigation into the requirements for consent to be ""informed"" in the context of health research. This work aims to provide a scoping review and analysis of relevant publications with ultimate purpose to examine whether the concept of 'data altruism', as stipulated within Article 2 (10) of the Data Governance Act (""DGA""), addresses the gaps left behind by the application of the legal basis of 'consent', under the GDPR (Art. 6 (1) and 7), in so far as the secondary uses of data for research are concerned. In this light the article, by exploring available solutions found in relevant literature and used in practice in national and European projects, examines how 'data altruism' can add any value and work as a cohesive solution that the research community can use.
The article, through its research, intends to answer the following questions:What gaps has the GDPR left when it comes to the interpretation and practical application of ""consent"" towards the secondary use of health data;Can the DGA, through the mechanism of 'data altruism', address these issues and provide a solution;What solutions have been used so far in practice to address this issue.
To address the above-mentioned questions, the Arskey and O'Malley scoping review methodology and best practice, as outlined in the Joanna Briggs scoping review guidelines, have been applied. The research questions have been identified through an extensive literature review and consultation with subject matter experts. The search was conducted using six search engines and utilising a tailored search strategy, with the application of both MESH and non-MESH based search terms. From the identified relevant publications, 148 abstracts were kept to be read and 60 of those publications were kept as relevant. A PRISMA chart showcases the process in which the publications were reviewed and the process which led to the final papers kept as relevant. The title-abstract and full text screening and charting the data were concluded independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies were then resolved by a third reviewer. Results are summarised in both chart and narrative form below.
The final 60 publications were then split into three subcategories: (i) GDPR critique (23 publications listed); (ii) iterations of consent and data altruism (21 publications listed); and (iii) proposed solutions and current practices (31 publications). Certain of the publications fell into more than one of the above subcategories, given the interdisciplinary element of the subject and theme of each paper. Throughout the research, 5 of the publications discuss the Data Governance Act and data altruism, with 4 of those providing a critique over the text used in the DGA and the concept of 'data altruism' in relation to 'consent' as defined within the GDPR and the overall legislative framework for the secondary uses of data.",,"The final 60 publications were then split into three subcategories: (i) GDPR critique (23 publications listed); (ii) iterations of consent and data altruism (21 publications listed); and (iii) proposed solutions and current practices (31 publications).

40070871,The application of tissue engineering strategies for uterine regeneration.,"Biomaterial, Biomolecule, Stem Cell, Tissue Engineering, Uterine Regeneration",Materials today. Bio,"Uterine injuries, particularly damages to endometrium, are usually associated with abnormal menstruation, recurrent miscarriage, pregnancy complications, and infertility. Tissue engineering using cell-based, biomolecule-based, or biomaterial and scaffold-based strategies has emerged as a novel and promising approach for uterine regeneration. Stem cells, biomolecules, and porous scaffolds used alone or, very often, used in combination as a more effective treatment means have shown great potential in promoting uterine regeneration. The reported preclinical studies have indicated that appropriate tissue engineering strategies could safely and effectively reconstruct not only endometrium but also partial or even the whole uterine structure. However, the progress in the uterine regeneration area is slow in comparison to that of regenerating many other body tissues and hence it still remains a great challenge to apply uterine tissue engineering for clinical applications. In this review, conventional treatments for uterine-related diseases are briefly reviewed and discussed first. Subsequently, tissue engineering strategies (cell-based, biomolecule-based, biomaterial and scaffold-based, or their combinations) for uterine repair in preclinical studies and clinical trials are presented and analyzed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in uterine regeneration are pointed and discussed. Despite various limitations and obstacles, the tissue engineering approach is viable and holds high promise for uterine regeneration.",,,,© 2025 The Authors.,10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.101594,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Shangsi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'James J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Min', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.'}"

Paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, and irinotecan, either as monotherapies or in combination with ramucirumab, are currently standard second-line treatments for GC. However, the efficacy of these therapies is limited, necessitating the development of new combination strategies to improve response rates. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown success in first-line treatment for advanced GC, leading to interest in immune rechallenge strategies for second-line treatment. Re-challenging patients with ICIs after progression on first-line treatment may restore immune responses and provide additional clinical benefit. Recently, cadonilimab (AK104), a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, has demonstrated promising antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy in advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. However, the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel combined with AK104 for the treatment of advanced GC remain unclear. Furthermore, identifying predictive biomarkers of efficacy is essential to developing personalized treatment strategies. This study aims to explore the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel combined with AK104 as a second-line treatment for patients who have progressed after first-line chemoimmunotherapy, focusing on evaluating the therapeutic effect of ICIs rechallenge in gastric cancer.
This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical study. Eligible patients were histologically or cytologically diagnosed with unresectable recurrent or metastatic GC, failed first-line chemotherapy in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor, aged between 18-75 years old, expected survival ≥3 months, and with a physical status of 0 or 1 in the Eastern Cooperative Cancer Group (ECOG). Enrolled patients will receive intravenous cadonilimab (AK104) 6 mg/kg on days 1, and 15, and intravenous nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m
This study is the first prospective trial to evaluate the combination of nab-paclitaxel and cadonilimab as second-line treatment after first-line chemoimmunotherapy failure. By investigating immune rechallenge, it aims to reactivate anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes in GC patients. The exploration of predictive biomarkers, such as ctDNA, TMB, MSI, PD-L1 expression, TIL profiles, and gut microbiota, will help personalize treatment and identify patients most likely to benefit from immune rechallenge. This trial could provide valuable insights into overcoming immune resistance and contribute to developing a promising second-line therapeutic strategy for advanced GC.

Despite guideline recommendations, AUCs are infrequently calculated because of the perceived adequacy of trough (Cmin) concentrations. Yet, the percentage of real-world patients with goal measured vancomycin trough concentrations that achieve target vancomycin AUC remains unknown.
A large cohort of internationally represented adult patients treated with vancomycin in 2021 and 2022 and therapeutic drug monitoring performed had data anonymized via an electronic clearinghouse at DoseMe. Unique patients, dosing events, and measured Cmin were identified. Patient-individualized AUC was calculated using a Bayesian method with 4 validated models. For each dosing event, Cmin and AUC pairs were compared and categorized as ""low,"" ""target,"" and ""high"" using the therapeutic ranges for Cmin of 15-20 mg/L and AUC of 400-600 mg × 24 hours/L.
In 2022, 17,711 adult patients from the European Union (4.9%), Australia (4.0%), and the United States (91.1%) had 26 769 measured trough levels obtained. Categorical disagreement between Cmin and AUC was 34.3%, with most disagreement (7959 Cmin levels, 30%) occurring with low Cmin but target AUC. Only 23% of paired Cmin and AUC were within range. AUC was variable for all trough categories (ie, low, target, and high).

40070652,Proposed research classification criteria for Lyme disease in infection associated chronic illness studies.,"chronic Lyme disease, clinical trials, clinical trials network, inclusion/exclusion criteria, infection associated chronic illness, post-treatment Lyme disease, research criteria",Frontiers in medicine,"Research on patients with persistent symptoms despite prior treatment for Lyme disease can be challenging to interpret given the diversity of criteria selected to characterize Lyme disease and to define the syndrome of those with persistent symptoms. Because most research studies only include patients with well-documented prior Lyme disease, the generalizability of the study results is limited, excluding the larger group of patients often seen in community practice who do not meet these stringent enrollment criteria. Researchers at the Lyme and other Tick-borne Diseases Clinical Trials Network (LTD-CTN) recognized early on that a research classification system was needed to facilitate the design of studies that are more inclusive. This paper presents a proposed research classification system.
Criteria used in published clinical research on previously treated Lyme disease were reviewed. Clinical expertise was provided by principal investigators in the LTD-CTN. Further input was obtained from a diverse panel of stakeholders in the field, including clinicians, academic researchers, and patient advocates. This classification system was developed based on feedback collected from all these sources.
The new research classification system proposes criteria for Lyme disease at different levels of diagnostic certainty: well-defined, probable, possible, and uncertain. Criteria for ascertainment for each classification level and additional factors to be considered in patient selection for research are described.
The proposed research classification system should improve the quality and generalizability of clinical research by providing clear case definitions for enrollment of a more diverse group of patients with sequelae from Lyme disease.",,"The new research classification system proposes criteria for Lyme disease at different levels of diagnostic certainty: well-defined, probable, possible, and uncertain.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used to treat patients with advanced MTC. Selpercatinib is a highly selective RET inhibitor used in the treatment of advanced RET-mutated MTC, having shown higher potency and fewer side effects compared to multikinase inhibitors in clinical trials. As a relatively new drug, its toxicity profile continues to be characterised. This report describes a case of severe acute hypocalcaemia in a 64-year-old male with advanced MTC treated with selpercatinib. The patient, who had stable hypoparathyroidism, experienced acute hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium 1.4 mmol/L) 2 weeks after initiating selpercatinib, requiring hospitalisation for calcium supplementation and monitoring. Selpercatinib was temporarily withheld and later reintroduced at a lower dose, successfully preventing recurrence of hypocalcaemia. Investigations excluded other common or important causes of hypocalcaemia, which led us to conclude that this could be a drug-related adverse event. This case highlights the need for careful monitoring of electrolyte disturbances in patients on selpercatinib, particularly those with pre-existing hypoparathyroidism. Although rare, the development of hypocalcaemia with RET inhibitors may necessitate dose interruptions and adjustments. Our experience has also illustrated that re-challenge with selpercatinib is feasible with appropriate management strategies.",,,,© the author(s).,10.1530/EO-24-0060,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Leslie', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Thyroid Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghaznavi', 'firstname': 'Syeda Khadijah', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology Department, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Stevens', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Thyroid Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoy', 'firstname': 'Sonja', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Thyroid Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Kee Howe', 'initials': 'KH', 'affiliation': 'Thyroid Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Malik', 'firstname': 'Tass', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'ENT Department, University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Newbold', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Thyroid Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Morganstein', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Thyroid Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.\nEndocrinology Department, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}"

Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), Mayo endoscopic score (MES) and Mayo score are frequently used in clinical trials. They rely on either the physician's observation of the inflammatory state of the patient's gastrointestinal tissue alone or combined with the patient's subjective evaluation of general wellbeing. Given the importance of these scores in evaluating the efficacy of drug treatment and disease severity, there has been interest in developing a computational approach to reliably predict these scores. A promising approach is using mechanistic models such as quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) which simulate the mechanisms of the disease and its modulation by the drug pharmacology. However, extending QSP model simulations to clinical score predictions has been challenging due to the limited availability of gut biopsy measurements and the subjective nature of some of the evaluation criteria for these scores that cannot be described using mechanistic relationships. In this perspective, we examine details of IBD disease activity scores and current progress in building predictive models for these scores (such as biomarkers for disease activity). Then, we propose a method to leverage simulated markers of inflammation from a QSP model to predict IBD clinical scores using a machine learning algorithm. We will demonstrate how this combined approach can be used to (1) explore mechanistic insights underlying clinical observations; and (2) simulate novel therapeutic strategies that could potentially improve clinical outcomes.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 Shim, Rehberg, Wagenhuber, van der Graaf and Chung.",10.3389/fphar.2025.1479666,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Shim', 'firstname': 'Jaehee V', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'Certara Applied BioSimulation, Sheffield, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Rehberg', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Sanofi R&D, Translational Disease Modeling, Frankfurt amMain, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagenhuber', 'firstname': 'Britta', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Sanofi R&D, Translational Disease Modeling, Frankfurt amMain, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Graaf', 'firstname': 'Piet H', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Certara Applied BioSimulation, Sheffield, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Systems Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Douglas W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Certara Applied BioSimulation, Sheffield, United Kingdom.'}"

Here, we present 18 infants with moderate to severely presenting OI who received neonatal care at a single center over a 5 yr period, 10 of which were delivered at our institution. All 18 infants survived to neonatal discharge, with 7 infants requiring respiratory support and 9 infants requiring feeding support at discharge. Through Fisher Exact Test, Mann-Whitney U Test and backward elimination regression, we do not observe that lethal or possibly lethal diagnoses prenatally were correlated with medically relevant outcomes such as need for respiratory support at discharge or need for feeding support at discharge. Sixteen of the eighteen individuals are alive, with a minority requiring either respiratory or feeding support. With a multidisciplinary team approach to neonatal care, outcomes may be optimized.

Key characteristics of the disease include persistent airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling. Asthma's chronic and recurrent characteristics contribute to airway remodeling and inflammation, which can exacerbate lung damage. Presently, inflammation is predominantly managed with corticosteroids, yet there is a notable absence of treatments specifically addressing airway remodeling. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is integral to the processes of inflammation, airway remodeling, and immune responses. Pharmacological agents targeting this pathway are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. This review elucidates the role of PI3K in the immune responses, airway inflammation, and remodeling associated with asthma, examining its underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we synthesize the existing literature on the therapeutic potential of PI3K inhibitors for asthma management, emphasizing immune modulation, airway inflammation, and remodeling, including drug development and ongoing clinical trials.

Autopsy studies demonstrate considerable pathological heterogeneity in corticobasal syndrome, with corticobasal degeneration pathology accounting for only ∼50% of clinically diagnosed individuals. Individualized disease stage and progression modelling of brain changes in corticobasal syndrome may have utility in predicting this underlying pathological heterogeneity, and in turn improve the design of clinical trials for emerging disease-modifying therapies. The aim of this study was to jointly model the phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity of corticobasal syndrome, to identify unique imaging subtypes based solely on a data-driven assessment of MRI atrophy patterns and then investigate whether these subtypes provide information on the underlying pathology. We applied Subtype and Stage Inference, a machine learning algorithm that identifies groups of individuals with distinct biomarker progression patterns, to a large cohort of 135 individuals with corticobasal syndrome (52 had a pathological or biomarker defined diagnosis) and 252 controls. The model was fit using volumetric features extracted from baseline T1-weighted MRI scans and then used to subtype and stage follow-up scans. The subtypes and stages at follow-up were used to validate the longitudinal consistency of the baseline subtype and stage assignments.

A scientific statement of the Heart Failure Association and the European Association of Preventive Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Aging, Chronic disease, Exercise tolerance, Frailty, Functional capacity, Heart failure, Physical activity, Quality of life",European journal of preventive cardiology,"For most patients with chronic, progressive illnesses, maintaining good quality of life (QoL), with preserved functional capacity, is just as crucial as prolonging survival. Patients with heart failure (HF) experience much worse QoL and effort intolerance than both the general population and people with other chronic conditions, since they present a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fatigue, fluid congestion, trouble with sleeping, and depression. These symptoms reduce patients' capacity for daily social and physical activity. Usual endpoints of large-scale trials in chronic HF have mostly been defined to evaluate treatments regarding hospitalizations and mortality, but more recently, patients' priorities and needs expressed with QoL are gaining more awareness and are being more extensively evaluated. This scientific statement aims at discussing the importance of QoL in HF, summarizing the most largely adopted questionnaires in HF care, and providing an overview on their application in trials and the potential for their transition to clinical practice. Finally, by discussing the reasons limiting their application in daily clinical routine and the strategies that may promote their implementation, this statement aims at fostering the systematic integration of the patient's standpoint in HF care.",,,,This article has been co-published with permission in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology and European Journal of Heart Failure.

After tooth extraction, 39 patients (40 teeth) were randomized (1:1) to receive ARP using moldable bone materials (SBX group) or particulate bone materials (PBX group). An absorbable collagen membrane was placed over the graft material and the surgical site was sutured. Cone-beam computed tomography was taken immediately and 5 months after ARP. Bone core samples from the implantation site were obtained for histomorphometric analysis 5 months after ARP.
Forty-six patients were screened and 39 of them completed the study. However, one patient who received split-mouth treatment was excluded, resulting in data from 38 patients being analyzed. In radiological evaluation, the changes in midbuccal alveolar bone height at 5 months were -0.753 ± 0.112 and -1.018 ± 0.111 mm in the SBX group and PBX groups, respectively (F = 2.895; p = 0.098; mean difference [MD] 0.265; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.051 to 0.582). Changes in the horizontal ridge width were measured at three levels (-1, -3, and -5 mm) below the most coronal aspect of the crest and showed a decrease in both groups, with no significant differences between the groups. The percent new bone area of the SBX group (39.156 ± 2.505) was significantly different from that of the PBX group (22.749 ± 2.476) (F = 22.171; p < 0.001; 95% MD 16.407; CI = 9.333 to 23.481). The percent residual material area was significantly lower in the SBX group (8.973 ± 2.211) compared to the PBX group (15.633 ± 2.186), with an F-statistic of 4.687 and p-value = 0.037 (MD -6.660; 95% CI = -12.904 to -0.415). The percent connective tissue area was 49.743 ± 4.199 and 56.657 ± 4.151 for the groups (F = 1.401; p = 0.245; MD -6.914; 95% CI = -18.773 to 4.944), respectively.
Radiological and histological results showed that use of moldable bone can achieve similar ARP parameters as those achieved by particulate bone.

Liquid biopsies are a minimally invasive approach for the identification of circulating tumor biomarkers through a simple blood sample. Assays capable of detecting MRD through analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are rapidly evolving for clinical study applications and therapeutic interventions. To address these opportunities, BLOODPAC-a multi-disciplinary consortium representing stakeholders from public, industry, academia, and regulatory agencies-formulated a lexicon that provides a shared framework and clear definitions using liquid biopsies for solid tumor MRD with an emphasis on ctDNA detection. The terms in the lexicon are categorized under general MRD, ctDNA testing methodologies, reporting results, and acquisition timepoints, including examples of current and potential clinical use cases for MRD tests. The overall goal is to provide a unified language and approaches to solid tumor MRD to advance applications of these technologies, allow data aggregation to strengthen future evidence, and facilitate regulatory approvals, leading to the use of liquid biopsy as an early endpoint in clinical trials. We believe that a common set of terminology and methods for solid tumor MRD can improve understanding and appropriate use of testing, accelerate clinical development, and improve outcomes for cancer patients.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

Categorical variables, Student's t test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for analysis.
All patients' scores of POP-Q were significantly improved after surgery. The scores of urinary frequency and urgency in the SSLF group improved significantly from 6 months after surgery, with statistical significance (p < 0.05), while the scores of nocturia and urgency in the EHUS group improved from 1 month after surgery (p < 0.05). The scores of questionnaires in both groups were significantly lower than those before surgery, while the EHUS group showed more significant improvement (p < 0.05).
EHUS is easy to operate, has a short operative time, fewer perioperative and postoperative complications, and the apical can be suspended well if the prolapse is not severe. It also has a certain degree of relief for LUTS, which is a new type of operation that is worthy of clinical promotion.",,"All patients' scores of POP-Q were significantly improved after surgery.

This study aimed to determine the frequency and causes of enteral nutrition interruption (ENI)and its impact on implementing enteral nutrition.
This is a secondary analysis of a multicentre, cluster-randomized controlled trial (N = 2772). This secondary analysis included patients in the ICU for at least 72 h and receiving total enteral nutrition. The causes of ENI were defined as (1) feeding intolerance, (2) diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and (3) others. Multiple linear regression analyses investigated the association between ENI and nutrition intake.
A total of 1331 patients were included for analysis. Approximately 18.63% of the patients experienced at least one episode of ENI. The main cause of ENI was diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Energy intake was 17.54 ± 6.85 versus 16.64 ± 7.06 (p = .065) among patients with and without ENI, and the protein intake was 0.69 ± 0.27 versus 0.64 ± 0.27 (p = .016). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ENI was significantly associated with diminishing energy and protein intake (B = -1.012, 95% CI -1.857 to -0.167, p = .019; B = -0.050, 95% CI -0.083 to -0.017, p = .003, respectively).
Based on this multicentre study about ENI, the incidence of interruptions in enteral nutrition was 18.6%, with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures being the leading causes. The occurrence of interruptions in the delivery of enteral nutrition leads to a reduction in the nutritional intake of critically ill patients.
Critical care nurses should establish comprehensive nutrition support protocols and strengthen the training of department nurses, equipping them with the skills to effectively prevent and manage ENI. This is essential for actively achieving feeding goals and improving the outcomes of ICU patients.",,"A total of 1331 patients were included for analysis.

40069960,Comparative Analysis of 5 cmH₂O Versus 10 cmH₂O PEEP on Cerebral Oxygen Saturation in Brain Tumor Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Study.,,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,"BACKGROUND The main concern regarding lung-protective ventilation strategies during neurosurgery is the reduction in venous return and increase in cerebral blood flow when using high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). This study aimed to evaluate and compare the changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturations (rSO2) during the use of 5 cmH₂O and 10 cmH₂O PEEP in patients undergoing craniotomy for tumor resection. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was designed as a prospective, single-blind randomized controlled study. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years, scheduled for an elective craniotomy for tumor resection, were divided into 2 groups: 5 cmH₂O PEEP (Group Low PEEP) and 10 cmH₂O PEEP (Group High PEEP). The PEEP was applied during general anesthesia, for controlled mechanical ventilation. The main outcome was the measurement of rSO2 before dura opening. Changes in rSO₂, hemodynamic parameters, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO₂) during different periods of surgery were compared between the groups. RESULTS Sixty-four patients were included. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups regarding demographic data. Mean arterial blood pressure and changes in SpO₂ were statistically similar in all periods between the groups (P=0.141 and P=0.081). When compared with the baseline value, SpO₂ increased significantly at all measurement times (P<0.05). No difference was observed in rSO₂ values compared with baseline rSO₂ values between the groups (P=0.218). CONCLUSIONS PEEP at the level of 10 cmH₂O can be safely applied during craniotomy without altering hemodynamics, and without causing a decrease in rSO₂.",,,,,10.12659/MSM.947379,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Şahinkaya', 'firstname': 'Halide Hande', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Izmir State Hospital, İzmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Tabanli', 'firstname': 'Alper', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine, Izmir Tinaztepe University, Izmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ozgenc', 'firstname': 'Gulsen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, Samandağ State Hospital, Hatay, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ayar', 'firstname': 'Caglar', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Izmir State Hospital, İzmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ak', 'firstname': 'Cafer', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosurgery, İzmir State Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Cirkinoglu', 'firstname': 'Gozde Gursoy', 'initials': 'GG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Izmir State Hospital, İzmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Altunbas', 'firstname': 'Sermin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Izmir State Hospital, İzmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Tekgül', 'firstname': 'Zeki Tuncel', 'initials': 'ZT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Izmir State Hospital, İzmir, Turkey.'}"

The aim of the study is to determine the oral health status, plaque index, oral health related quality of life, and concentration of fluoride in saliva, after the application of fluorinated varnishes, of pregnant women participating in a preventive oral health program.
A randomized clinical trial was carried out on pregnant patients involved in an oral health program. Data was collected on socio-demographic aspects, hygiene habits, beliefs, epidemiological indexes such as Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT); International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS); Community Periodontal Index (CPI); Caries Management by Risk Assessment (CAMBRA); and the Oral Health Related Quality of Life Index (OHIP-14). Three reviews were carried out during the gestation period (Day 1, 15, and 30). The fluoride varnishes applied in the study were Clinpro White Varnish, Profluorid Varnish, and MI Varnish.
A total of 89 women were evaluated. Most patients were Spanish and married, with a mean age of 34.3. The mean DMFT was 7.2 (± 4.51), the plaque index was 52%, and there was a low risk of caries. A poorer quality of life was linked to an increased risk of caries, high DMFT values, high ICDAS codes, and high plaque index. The concentration of fluoride in saliva immediately after the application with MI Varnish reaches values of fluor concentration 238.51 ± 151.87 much higher than the other varnishes (p < 0.05); however, after 30 days the values were reduced without significant differences for the three study groups Clinpro White Varnish (0.21 ± 0.29), MI Varnish (0.34 ± 0.34) and Profluorid Varnish (0.16 ± 0.07).

Psychological flexibility (PF), characterized by the ability to adapt functionally and congruently to diverse situations based on personal values, may play a crucial role in determining HRQoL. This study aims to examine the associations between symptoms of depression, anxiety or insomnia or PF and HRQoL among individuals with PPS associated with (i) the indoor environment (IE), (ii) chronic fatigue, or (iii) both.
We utilized the baseline data (n = 103) from a randomized controlled trial focused on improving the HRQoL of individuals (mean age 46.1, SD 7.8, 86% women) experiencing PPS associated with IE or chronic fatigue. Self-report questionnaires were administered to evaluate symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and dimensions of PF, including acceptance, cognitive fusion, and thought suppression. The primary outcome was HRQoL, assessed using a 15D questionnaire. The association between symptoms, PF dimensions, and HRQoL was examined using Pearson's correlation and ANCOVA.
Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were negatively associated with HRQoL (p <.001) across all participants. Among individuals with PPS associated with IE, higher PF was significantly associated with higher HRQoL. No association was found between PF and HRQoL in those with chronic fatigue-associated PPS or both conditions.

However, many foods are highly processed, raising the question as to their effect on body weight. This secondary analysis assessed the associations between changes in processed food intake and weight loss in 244 overweight adults randomly assigned to a vegan (n = 122) or control group (n = 122) for 16 weeks. Three-day dietary records were analyzed using the NOVA system, which categorizes foods from 1 to 4, based on degree of processing. A repeated measure ANOVA, Pearson correlations, and a multivariate regression model were used for statistical analysis. The consumption of animal foods in categories 1-4 decreased in the vegan group, compared with the control group. Body weight decreased in the vegan group (treatment effect - 5.9 kg [95% CI -6.7 to -5.0]; Gxt, p < 0.001). Changes in consumption of animal foods in categories 1-4 were positively associated with changes in body weight: r = + 0.34; p < 0.001 for category 1; r = + 0.18; p = 0.008 for category 2; r = + 0.17; p = 0.01 for category 3; and r = + 0.22; p = 0.001 for category 4. In no NOVA category was the consumption of plant-based processed foods positively and significantly associated with weight gain. The top three independent predictors of weight loss were reduced intakes of processed, unprocessed or minimally processed, and ultra-processed animal foods. These findings suggest that replacing animal products with plant-based foods may be an effective weight-loss strategy, even when processed plant-based foods are included.",,,,© 2025.

40069830,Efficacy and safety of gastrodin in preventing postoperative delirium following cardiac surgery: a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial.,"Cardiac surgery, Delirium, Gastrodin","Critical care (London, England)","Delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common complications post-cardiac surgery, yet no specific medical intervention is currently recommended for prevention. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of gastrodin infusion in preventing delirium and POCD in critically ill patients following cardiac surgery.
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on patients aged 18-75, scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, with or without valve replacement. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive gastrodin infusion 600 mg twice daily or placebo from the day of surgery until the postoperative day (POD) 6. The co-primary outcomes were the incidences of delirium and POCD, assessed from ICU admission until POD 7 and at 1 and 3 months postoperatively. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (ChiCTR1800020414).
Of 160 randomized participants, 155 were analyzed (77 gastrodin, 78 placebo) according to a modified intention to treat principle. The incidence of postoperative delirium was 19.5% in the gastrodin group and 35.9% in the placebo group, with a significant relative risk of 0.54 (95% CI 0.32-0.93, p = 0.022). The incidence of in-hospital POCD was 2.9% and 4.0% in the placebo and gastrodin groups, respectively. The odds of hospital discharge were significantly greater in the gastrodin group (subhazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI 1.00-1.84; p = 0.049). Adverse events occurred in 9.1% (7/77) of patients administered gastrodin and 14.1% (11/78) of patients administered the placebo, with none being drug-related.

40069816,"Efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma as an adjunct therapy to split thickness skin graft in burn patients with granulating raw wounds: a prospective, randomized, double-blind study-study protocol.","Graft take, PRP, Post burn raw area",Trials,"Burn wounds are commonly encountered in clinical settings and the management aims at the prevention of mortality and morbidity due to disability. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is blood-derived biomaterial that is enriched with growth factors and cytokines that facilitate wound healing. The PRP has proven its efficacy in various other wounds, but its role in post-burn raw areas and graft take has not been validated. This proposed multicentre randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma as an adjunct therapy to split-thickness skin graft in burn patients with granulating raw wounds.
This trial is an investigator-initiated, double-blind multicentre, randomized controlled parallel arm trial alongside trial cost-effectiveness analysis. Granulating deep second-degree and third-degree burns affecting 3-20% of total body surface area (TBSA) at 10-14th post-burn day will be included in the study. A total of 550 patients (275 in each group) will be randomized to receive either standard skin graft or allogenic PRP with skin graft treatment. The primary endpoint will be the mean percentage of graft-take on the 14th postoperative day. The result will be analyzed by two independent assessors who are blinded to the study. Secondary endpoints include (a) time taken for complete wound healing; (b) frequency of adverse events; (c) follow-up with scar index at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) score; (d) cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention compared to the comparator; and (e) to estimate in a subset of participants the association between growth factor levels (PDGF BB and TGF ß-1) of activated PRP and clinical response.
The proposed trial will be expected to verify the efficacy and safety of PRP for split-thickness skin graft (STSG) in deep second-degree or third-degree granulating wounds of burn patients based on the outcome of the study.",,,,© 2025. The Author(s).,"10.1186/s13063-025-08757-2

40069815,Elastic stable intramedullary nails compared to locking compression plates for treating unstable distal ulnar fractures in adults: a prospective comparative study.,"Distal ulna fracture, Elastic stable intramedullary nail, Locking compression plate, Open reduction and internal fixation",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,"Distal ulna fractures often occur in conjunction with distal radius fractures and other associated injuries. Currently, there are no satisfactory internal fixation systems available for addressing unstable distal ulna fractures, and a definitive consensus on the most effective treatment approach is still lacking. The objective of this research was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of using elastic stable intramedullary nails (ESIN) compared to locking compression plates (LCP) for treating unstable distal ulnar fractures in adults.
In a prospective clinical study, a total of 54 patients (21 females and 33 males; average age 49.3 years, ranging from 30 to 63 years) suffering from unstable or displaced fractures of the distal ulna were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups between January 2021 and August 2024. Specifically, 26 patients underwent treatment utilizing elastic stable intramedullary nails, whereas 28 patients were managed using locking compression plates. The two groups were evaluated prospectively for perioperative data and functional results.
The ESIN group comprised 26 patients, exhibiting a mean age of 48.27 years (with a range of 30 to 62 years), while the LCP group included 28 patients, whose mean age was 50.33 years (ranging from 32 to 63 years). Both groups were comparable regarding gender distribution, side of injury, mechanisms of injury, and classifications of fractures. However, there were significant differences noted in incision length of the ulna, surgical duration, frequency of fluoroscopy, and the rates of excellent and good functional outcomes as measured by the Gartland-Werley scores between the two groups (P < 0.05). Conversely, no significant differences were found concerning the time to union and the duration of immobilization between the two groups (P > 0.05).
ESIN offers several advantages, including reduced incision length, lower frequency of fluoroscopy, shorter duration of the surgical procedure, decreased complication rates, and improved Gartland-Werly scores. Therefore, fixation using ESIN serves as an effective alternative for the treatment of distal ulnar fractures in adults. The minimally invasive nature and lower complication rates are defining characteristics of ESIN fixation.",,"The ESIN group comprised 26 patients, exhibiting a mean age of 48.27 years (with a range of 30 to 62 years), while the LCP group included 28 patients, whose mean age was 50.33 years (ranging from 32 to 63 years).

40069810,"""Like a rollercoaster"": carer experiences of residential treatment for eating disorders.","Carer, Eating disorder, Identity, Interdependence, Lived experience, Parent, Qualitative, Residential treatment",Journal of eating disorders,"Residential facilities for eating disorders are becoming increasingly common, providing recovery-oriented care in less restrictive environments compared to traditional hospital treatments. Despite their popularity, there is a lack of research regarding parent and carer experiences of residential programs. Furthermore, while the impact of eating disorders on parents and caregivers is well-documented, understandings of their lived experiences remain limited. The aim of this study was to explore parent and carer lived experiences of Australia's first residential facility for the treatment of eating disorders.
As part of a clinical evaluation (June 2021 - August 2023), 15 parents participated in a semi-structured interview about their experience of residential treatment. Transcripts were analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis.
Analysis generated six main themes from the data: (1) When everything is still not enough; (2) They were giving us hope; (3) I just felt relief; (4) I can resume the role of loving parent; (5) We almost need our own therapist; and, (6) Treatment access: There needs to be a hundred more. These themes collectively highlight both the burden of caring for a loved one with an ED and parents' experiences of residential treatment. Overall, participants described residential treatment as providing respite and hope, enabling them to reclaim aspects of their lives that had been overshadowed by the eating disorder. Although not a ""magic cure"", residential care was viewed as an essential component of a broader continuum of care.
This research highlights the unique benefits of the residential model and the importance of a compassionate care environment, while underscoring the importance of supporting caregivers throughout the treatment process. Given the critical role of carers in treatment outcomes, further research is essential to deepen our understandings of the carer experience and develop interventions that support both the experiencing person and their primary support people.
This study was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR12621001651875p).
Residential treatment for eating disorders is becoming more common, yet we still know little about how parents and caregivers experience these programs. Carers of adult children with eating disorders often face unique challenges and frequently play a key role in treatment success, making it essential to better understand their experiences to improve the care and support provided to experiencing persons and their key support people. In this study, we interviewed 15 carers about their experiences with Australia’s first residential facility for treating eating disorders. The analysis of these interviews revealed six main themes that provide insight into the caregivers’ feelings of respite and hope, as well as their journey to reclaim aspects of their lives overshadowed by their loved ones’ eating disorders. Although not a “magic cure”, residential care was seen as a vital part of a broader continuum of care. The study emphasises the need for compassionate support and calls for more research to enhance our understandings of the caregiver experience and to develop interventions that support both the individual in treatment and their primary caregivers.",,"Analysis generated six main themes from the data: (1) When everything is still not enough; (2) They were giving us hope; (3) I just felt relief; (4) I can resume the role of loving parent; (5) We almost need our own therapist; and, (6) Treatment access: There needs to be a hundred more.

In these post hoc, blinded analyses of plasma and CSF samples from the completed two-site placebo controlled randomized trial testing of 1500 mg PO BID oral nicotinamide, we used mass spectroscopy to measure nicotinamide and its inactive metabolite 1-methyl-nicotinamide in plasma at baseline, 6, and 12 months and in CSF at baseline and 12 months from 23 participants on drug and 24 on placebo.
Pharmacokinetic analysis found mean 12 month plasma nicotinamide increased > 130-fold to 52 μM while mean methyl-nicotinamide increased > 600-fold to 91 μM in individuals receiving nicotinamide compared to those receiving placebo, whose levels were unchanged from baseline. However, CSF nicotinamide was only measurable in 6 of the 19 available participants (32%) (mean increase of at least 147-fold to 18 μM). These CSF nicotinamide concentrations were 66% of their plasma levels, indicating good CNS bioavailability in only some participants. In contrast to CSF nicotinamide, more treated participants had higher CSF methyl-nicotinamide (n = 9, 43 μM), suggesting high-dosage nicotinamide was sufficient to pass the blood-brain barrier, but 13 of 19 were metabolically inactivated. Treatment favorably decreased mean pTau
Our findings suggest that oral administration markedly increased mean plasma nicotinamide levels, however CSF levels were below quantitation in a majority of participants and there was extensive metabolic inactivation to methyl-nicotinamide. Both the bioavailability and rapid metabolic methylation need to be addressed if nicotinamide is further developed as a potential intervention for AD.

Health risk behaviours are important modifiable determinants for the onset and aggravation of various mental health disorders, in which, university students generally exhibit poor engagement. Thus, this study aims to determine the efficacy of health behaviour interventions in relation to change in health behaviour and mental health outcomes, the impact of interventions (i.e., penetration, fidelity, and implementation), intervention characteristics associated with improved outcomes (efficacy) and the economic evaluation of interventions.
Six electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) published from the 1st January 2012 to 11th July 2023. Eligible RCTs included university students, evaluated behavioural interventions targeting health behaviours (i.e. dietary intake, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, alcohol use, substance use, smoking, and sleep) and reported a change in both health behaviour and mental health outcomes.
Twenty-two RCTs met the study inclusion criteria. Overall, only seven studies were effective in improving both health behaviour and mental health outcomes, with most (n = 4) focused on improving sleep behaviours. Insufficient evidence was found regarding intervention impact, intervention characteristics associated with improved outcomes and the economic evaluation of interventions to guide future implementation of health behaviour interventions in universities due to inadequate reporting of outcomes.

40069756,Efficacy of nutrient supplements in managing malnutrition and sarcopenia in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.,"COPD, Chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, Meta-analysis, Nutrition",Systematic reviews,"COPD patients suffering from malnutrition or sarcopenia often incur higher healthcare costs and experience adverse clinical outcomes. Despite this, the effectiveness of nutrient supplements in this population remains uncertain.
Two reviewers will independently search seven databases-PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Cochrane Library-for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before August 31, 2024. These RCTs should compare the effects of nutrient supplements against either a standard diet or placebo supplements in patients with COPD. The risk of bias in the included studies will be evaluated using the modified Jadad scale and the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Data synthesis will be conducted using RevMan software. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) will be applied to the primary outcomes. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the findings.
Ethical approval is not required because this study is a secondary analysis of existing data. We will disseminate the findings through peer- reviewed publications.
CRD42024585694.
This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a thorough assessment of the efficacy of nutrient supplements in COPD patients, covering a wide range of studies. ·The use of the modified Jadad scale and the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool ensures a robust evaluation of study quality.

40069748,Comparing HemoCue® and Quantitative Buffy Coat® and Coulter Counter-measured haemoglobin concentrations in African children with acute uncomplicated malaria: a Bland-Altman analysis.,"Anaemia, Bland–Altman analysis, Coulter Counter, Haemoglobin, HemoCue, Malaria, QBC®",Malaria journal,"Anaemia is a deleterious consequence of malaria, and its accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management. However, laboratory methods for measuring haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, like the Coulter Counter and the Quantitative Buffy Coat® (QBC®), are costly and not widely accessible in resource-limited settings. The point-of-care HemoCue® test is a cheaper alternative and suitable in rural areas. The study aimed to determine the level of agreement between Coulter Counter/QBC® vs. HemoCue®-measured Hb concentrations by Bland-Altman analysis.
As part of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of single low-dose primaquine in Ugandan and Congolese children with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, Hb concentrations were measured on days 0, 3, 7, and 28 using Coulter Counter (Uganda, n = 1880 paired values), QBC® (DR Congo, n = 1984 paired values) and HemoCue® Hb-301™. The predefined clinically acceptable limits were set at ± 0.5 g/dL.
The Bland-Altman analysis showed that the HemoCue® minus Coulter Counter mean Hb difference was - 0.15 g/dL with lower and upper limits of agreement of - 3.68 g/dL and 3.39 g/dL, respectively. Corresponding HemoCue® minus QBC® values were - 0.23 g/dL, - 1.66 g/dL and 1.22 g/dL. Linear regression of Hb concentration differences vs. mean Hb concentrations showed negative correlations: r = - 0.43 and r = - 0.34 for HemoCue® vs. Coulter Counter and HemoCue® vs. QBC®, respectively.
Compared to Coulter and QBC®, mean HemoCue® measured Hb concentrations were lower and, compared to the Coulter or QBC® methods, had an overall tendency to measure lower Hb concentrations with increasing Hb concentrations. Upper and lower limits of agreement were wider than the predefined clinically acceptable limits of ± 0.5 g/dL. HemoCue® should be used with caution in settings where decisions about blood transfusions are made.",,"The Bland-Altman analysis showed that the HemoCue® minus Coulter Counter mean Hb difference was - 0.15 g/dL with lower and upper limits of agreement of - 3.68 g/dL and 3.39 g/dL, respectively.

40069741,Effectiveness of personalized open-face mask combined with styrofoam fixation in radiotherapy treatment of head and neck cancers: a prospective randomized controlled trial.,"Anxiety and depression, Comfort, Head and neck cancer, Personalized open-face mask, Positioning accuracy","Radiation oncology (London, England)","The primary aim of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of implementing an innovative immobilization approach, spec ically the utilization of personalized open-face masks in combination with styrofoam fixation, for head and neck cancers receiving radiotherapy. The study seeks to evaluate the influence of this method on improving patients' precision in positioning and their overall comfort during the treatment process, in addition to exploring its potential capacity to mitigate the occurrence of anxiety and depression in this patient population.
A prospective, randomized controlled trial was undertaken to investigate the comparative efficacy of two immobilization approaches for the radiotherapy treatment of head and neck cancers. The experimental group was randomly assigned to receive fixation using personalized open-face masks with nose and mouth apertures, while the control group was immobilized using closed-face masks. Weekly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were conducted pre-treatment to assess and record setup errors along three axes. Comparative analysis of setup errors and the planning target volume (PTV) margin between the two groups was performed. Furthermore, the patients' comfort levels and anxiety and depression status were evaluated using the modified Likert questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
A total of 106 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 53) or the control group (n = 53). There were no statistically significant differences observed between the two groups in terms of age, sex, and disease type indicating comparability. Analysis of the setup errors along different directions showed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in the X direction (0.90 ± 0.84 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.85 mm, p = 0.825), Y direction (1.26 ± 0.98 mm vs. 1.37 ± 1.09 mm, p = 0.172), Z direction (1.18 ± 0.84 mm vs. 1.15 ± 0.98 mm, p = 0.651), and Rtn direction (0.65 ± 0.57 vs. 0.62 ± 0.55, p = 0.489). Evaluating the local setup errors in the experimental and control groups, there were no significant differences observed in the X direction (1.13 ± 1.15 mm vs. 1.01 ± 0.89 mm, p = 0.152) and Z direction (1.31 ± 0.88 mm vs. 1.26 ± 1.17 mm, p = 0.549). However, a significant difference was found in the Y direction (1.49 ± 1.19 mm vs. 1.80 ± 1.45 mm, p = 0.003). The Rtn direction also did not show a significant difference (0.90 ± 0.81 vs. 0.84 ± 0.73, p = 0.328). The PTV margin in the X, Y, and Z directions were determined as 2.20 mm, 3.12 mm, and 2.57 mm in the experimental group and 2.35 mm, 3.58 mm, and 2.86 mm in the control group, respectively. The personalized open-face mask patients reported higher levels of comfort compared to the perforated head, neck, and shoulder thermoplastic mask (31.32 ± 1.16 vs. 30.00 ± 1.49, p < 0.001). The prevalence rates of anxiety in the experimental and control groups were as follows: (18.8% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.399), (18.8% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.584), (23.4% vs. 25%, p = 0.856), and (23.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.283).
In head and neck cancer radiotherapy, we propose the idea of personalized open-face mask combined with styrofoam for the first time, which can improve patient comfort without sacrificing positioning accuracy, and has a tendency to relieve patients' tension and anxiety. It is worth promoting and using in clinical positioning.",,"A total of 106 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 53) or the control group (n = 53).

Analysis of the setup errors along different directions showed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in the X direction (0.90 ± 0.84 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.85 mm, p = 0.825), Y direction (1.26 ± 0.98 mm vs. 1.37 ± 1.09 mm, p = 0.172), Z direction (1.18 ± 0.84 mm vs. 1.15 ± 0.98 mm, p = 0.651), and Rtn direction (0.65 ± 0.57 vs. 0.62 ± 0.55, p = 0.489). Evaluating the local setup errors in the experimental and control groups, there were no significant differences observed in the X direction (1.13 ± 1.15 mm vs. 1.01 ± 0.89 mm, p = 0.152) and Z direction (1.31 ± 0.88 mm vs. 1.26 ± 1.17 mm, p = 0.549). However, a significant difference was found in the Y direction (1.49 ± 1.19 mm vs. 1.80 ± 1.45 mm, p = 0.003). The Rtn direction also did not show a significant difference (0.90 ± 0.81 vs. 0.84 ± 0.73, p = 0.328). The PTV margin in the X, Y, and Z directions were determined as 2.20 mm, 3.12 mm, and 2.57 mm in the experimental group and 2.35 mm, 3.58 mm, and 2.86 mm in the control group, respectively. The personalized open-face mask patients reported higher levels of comfort compared to the perforated head, neck, and shoulder thermoplastic mask (31.32 ± 1.16 vs. 30.00 ± 1.49, p < 0.001). The prevalence rates of anxiety in the experimental and control groups were as follows: (18.8% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.399), (18.8% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.584), (23.4% vs. 25%, p = 0.856), and (23.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.283).",,© 2025.

40069719,Toward European harmonization of national myasthenia gravis registries: modified Delphi procedure-based expert consensus on collectable data.,"Delphi procedure, European registry, Expert panel, Myasthenia gravis, Rare disease registry",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder. Several new treatment concepts have emerged in recent years, but access to these treatments varies due to differing national reimbursement regulations, leading to disparities across Europe. This highlights the need for high-quality data collection by stakeholders to establish MG registries. A European MG registry could help bridge the treatment access gap across different countries, offering critical data to support regulatory decisions, foster international collaborations, and enhance clinical and epidemiological research. Several national MG registries already exist or are in development. To avoid duplication and ensure harmonization in data collection, a modified Delphi procedure was implemented to identify essential data elements for inclusion in national registries.
Following a literature review, consultations with patient associations and pharmaceutical companies, and input from multiple European MG experts, 100 data elements were identified. Of these, 62 reached consensus for inclusion and classification, while only 1 item was agreed for exclusion. 30 items failed to reach the ≥ 80% agreement threshold and were excluded. Among the 62 accepted items, 21 were classified as mandatory data elements, 32 optional, and 9 items pertained to the informed consent form.
Through a modified Delphi procedure, consensus was successfully achieved. This consensus-based approach represents a crucial step toward harmonizing MG registries across Europe. The resulting dataset will facilitate the sharing of knowledge and enhance European collaborations. Furthermore, the harmonized data may assist in regulatory or reimbursement decisions regarding novel therapies, as well as address treatment access disparities between European countries.",,"Following a literature review, consultations with patient associations and pharmaceutical companies, and input from multiple European MG experts, 100 data elements were identified.

40069710,"Efficacy and safety of cadonilimab (PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific) in combination with chemotherapy in anti-PD-1-resistant recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.","Cadonilimab, Immunotherapy rechallenge, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific",BMC medicine,"We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab (anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 bispecific antibody) plus TPC chemotherapy (NAB-paclitaxel, cisplatin or lobaplatin, and capecitabine) in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC) who failed to PD-1 inhibitor-containing regimens.
In this single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study, RM-NPC patients who failed to at least one line of systemic chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy were enrolled and received cadonilimab plus TPC chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, followed by cadonilimab plus capecitabine every 3 weeks for a maximum of 2 years. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), and safety.
Twenty-five patients were enrolled (84% male; median age 44 years (range, 24-60)), with a median follow-up of 10.2 months. The ORR was 68%, with 3 complete responses, 14 partial responses, and 6 stable diseases. The median DoR was 9.1 months (95% CI, 3.8-14.5 months). The median PFS was 10.6 months (95% CI, 5.2-16.0 months). The 12-month OS was 75.6%. Treatment was well tolerated. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 12 (48%) patients. Fourteen patients (56%) experienced potentially immune-related adverse events (irAEs). One patient experienced a grade 3 immune-related rash and another patient had grade 3 immune-related lipase increased. No treatment-related death occurred.
Cadonilimab in combination with TPC chemotherapy demonstrated promising antitumoral efficacy and manageable toxicities in patients with RM-NPC who failed frontline immunotherapy. Further trials are warranted to confirm and expand these findings.

40069690,Impact of combined high-intensity bodyweight interval training and breathing exercise on cardiometabolic health in normal-weight middle-aged adults with hypertension.,"Breathing exercise, Combined exercise, High intensity bodyweight interval training, Hypertensive adults, Physical health",BMC public health,"High-intensity interval training and breathing exercises alone have well-documented health benefits in people with hypertension. This study aimed to investigated the effects of combining the two methods on physical health among adults with hypertension.
Ninety-six adults (59.4 ± 9.1 years; 84% female; BMI 22.7 ± 1.6 kg/m
The BE group showed the greatest reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to CON, although differences among the exercise groups were not statistically significant. The increase in 6MWT values in the combined exercise group differed significantly compared to the other three groups (p = 0.000 and effect size = 0.296). The combined exercise group showed significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels compared to the control group. The average reduction in total cholesterol levels was 20.8 mg/dL (95% C: -41.9 - 0.4) with an effect size of 0.103. Meanwhile, the decrease in LDL and triglyceride levels was 20.1 mg/dL (95% CI: -37.6--2.5; p = 0.014) and -40.4 mg/dL (95% CI: -82.1-1.3; p = 0.04) with effect sizes of 0.118 and 0.101.
In conclusion combined exercise for 10 weeks could lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increase CRF, and improved lipid profile. As a clinical implication, the results of this study can be an alternative or complementary approach to treatment for hypertension, potentially reducing the need for medications and their associated side effects.

40069683,Dual intra-articular injections of corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid versus single corticosteroid injection for ankle osteoarthritis: a randomized comparative trial.,"Ankle, Hyaluronic acid, Injection, Osteoarthritis, Steroid",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"Intra-articular corticosteroid injection is commonly used for pain relief in ankle osteoarthritis (OA). The effects of corticosteroids (CS) are short-lived, whereas hyaluronic acid (HA) have longer-lasting effects. The objective was to compare the efficacy of dual injections of CS and HA to CS alone. We hypothesized that intra-articular injections of dual agents would be more effective than CS alone.
A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial was designed to investigate this hypothesis. 135 patients with ankle OA were enrolled into an intra-articular CS injection group (CS group, n = 61) or dual HA plus CS injection group (CS + HA group, n = 74). The CS group received 1 mL of corticosteroid and 1 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and 1 mL of normal saline once, and the CS + HA group received 3 mL of a total of 5 mL mixtures containing 2 mL of HA, or 1 mL of corticosteroid, 0.5% bupivacaine, and normal saline in the first week, followed by 2 mL of HA in the second and third weeks. Clinical evaluations were performed before injection, 6 and 12 weeks after the first injections. The Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale (AOS) was used as the primary outcome measure, and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and complications were used as secondary outcomes.
The mean AOS change from baseline was significantly greater in the CS + HA group than in the CS group at 6 (p ≤ 0.01) and 12 weeks (p ≤ 0.01). The mean VAS change from baseline was significantly greater in the CS group than in the CS + HA group at 6 weeks (p = 0.023), but not at 12 weeks (p = 0.731). The mean SF-36 change from baseline was not significant between the CS and CS + HA groups at 6 (p = 0.416) and 12 weeks (p = 0.215).
The combination of corticosteroid and HA injection is more effective than corticosteroid alone in relieving pain in ankle OA.

40069676,"Evaluating the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in diminishing the duration and frequency of rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis: a preliminary randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.","Children, Clinical trial, Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, N-acetylcysteine, Rotavirus",BMC pediatrics,"Globally, gastroenteritis stands as a primary contributor to child mortality, annually taking the lives of 3 million children under the age of 5 years. Rotavirus, a major factor in viral diarrhea among children aged 6 months to 2 years, presents with severe symptoms such as watery diarrhea and vomiting. Although mortality rates have decreased due to supportive care and vaccines, promising alternatives like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) show potential benefits in laboratory studies, indicating a possible supplementary strategy for managing rotavirus infections by reducing the duration and antigen excretion in feces.
During this double-blind clinical trial, 71 patients, confirmed to have gastroenteritis resulting from rotavirus using a rapid diagnostic strip, were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was prescribed NAC at a dosage of 60 mg/kg/day, while the other received a placebo. The patient's progress was monitored daily until their gastroenteritis improved, and details regarding the duration of diarrhea and the frequency of bowel movements were recorded for each participant.
The average duration of diarrhea in the NAC group and the placebo group was 2 and 3 days, respectively, with a level of p = 0.121. During the diarrhea period, the number of bowel movements in the NAC group was recorded at 28.1 ± 21.6 times, whereas in the placebo group, it was 35.3 ± 33.1 times, yielding a p-value of 0.409.
Even though the effects of NAC were observed in lowering the duration of the period and decreasing the frequency of bowel movements in gastroenteritis, these results did not reach statistical significance. Hence, the data from this study suggest that NAC may not effectively reduce the duration of diarrhea and the frequency of bowel movements linked to gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus.

40069670,Effect of aromatherapy with lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) on the anxiety of patients undergoing scaling and root planning: a randomized clinical trial.,"Aromatherapy, Blood pressure, Cymbopogon, Dental anxiety, Heart rate, Oils, Oxygen saturation, Pain",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,"Anxiety is one of the most common factors that prevent people from going to a dentist. Therefore, finding a solution to better control stress has been an important issue in recent studies. Lemongrass positively affects the prevention of dental anxiety. The literature has shown that aromatherapy may regulate hemodynamic factors in patients. This study investigated the effects of the aroma of lemongrass on anxiety levels and hemodynamic factors during nonsurgical periodontal treatment.
Thirty-eight patients were divided into two groups. First, the patients were asked to complete the Spielberger questionnaire to measure their level of dental anxiety. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, pain and satisfaction with treatment were evaluated. In the case group, nonsurgical periodontal therapy was performed while the patient inhaled the aroma of the lemongrass. Scaling was performed without intervention in the control group. The patients were then asked to complete the questionnaire again, and all the variables mentioned were remeasured.
Aromatherapy with lemongrass caused significant reductions in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, heart rate, and anxiety scores of patients. On the other hand, the differences in blood oxygen saturation changes, amount of pain and treatment satisfaction were insignificant between the two groups.
Inhalation of lemongrass essential oil appears beneficial for reducing anxiety and associated hemodynamic changes. Thus, aromatherapy with lemongrass may alleviate dental patients' anxiety.

40069657,Long-term cost-effectiveness of health behaviour intervention to manage type 2 diabetes in Nepal.,"Health behaviour intervention, Long-term cost-effectiveness, Markov modelling, Type 2 diabetes",BMC medicine,"Long-term cost-effectiveness analyses of health behaviour interventions to effectively manage type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in low-income countries are crucial for minimising economic burden and optimising resource allocation. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of implementing a health behaviour intervention to manage T2DM in Nepal.
A Markov model in combination with a decision tree was developed to compare the costs and outcomes of the health behaviour intervention against usual care among 481 (238-intervention and 243-control) participants from healthcare system and societal perspectives. The model integrates empirical trial data, with published data to inform parameters not collected during the trial. The model estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness over 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and a lifetime time horizons with 3% annual discounting. Sub-group, scenarios, both one-way and two-way analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in the model under the threshold of 3 times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (i.e., US $4140) for Nepal.
Base-case analysis with lifetime horizon showed that the health behaviour intervention compared to usual care improved QALYs by 3.88 and increased costs by US $4293 per patient, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $1106 per QALY gained from a healthcare system perspective. From a societal perspective, QALYs also improved by 3.88 and costs increased by US $4550, with an ICER of US $1173 per QALY gained. Furthermore, the intervention demonstrated ICERs of US $636, US $678, US $637, and US $632 per QALY gained over 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year time horizons, respectively, from a healthcare system perspective, and US $719, US $766, US $659, and US $716 per QALY gained from a societal perspective. In the PSA, the probability of the health behaviour intervention being cost-effective was over 57%.
The health behaviour intervention for managing T2DM was cost-effective over a lifetime horizon compared to usual care. To maximise its impact, this intervention should be scaled up nationwide, and future research is warranted to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness across diverse settings in low-income countries.

40069655,Comparison of hyaluronic acid and platelet-rich plasma in knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review.,"Hyaluronic acid, Intra-articular injection, Knee osteoarthritis, Meta-analysis, Platelet-rich plasma",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disorder, and intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) are frequently employed therapeutic interventions. However, there remains controversy regarding their efficacy. This systematic review aims to compare the effectiveness and safety of HA and PRP through a meta-analysis, with the objective of identifying the optimal treatment protocol for KOA and enhancing its management.
Randomized controlled trials evaluating the clinical outcomes of patients receiving intra-articular injections of either HA or PRP were included as eligible studies. Two independent investigators assessed the selected studies and evaluated their risk of bias. Primary outcome measures included the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and other relevant assessment indices. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data analysis was conducted using RevMan software (version 5.3).
A total of forty-two randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between the patient populations in the two groups. The analysis demonstrated that PRP resulted in lower VAS and WOMAC scores compared to HA. Additionally, PRP exhibited superior performance across other evaluation indices. Notably, the incidence of adverse events was higher in the PRP group; however, all reported complications were mild.
Based on the current evidence, intra-articular injection of PRP appears to be more effective than HA for the treatment of KOA, as indicated by the analysis of VAS, WOMAC scores, and other evaluation indices.

The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of seroconversion in subjects who received the first dose of SARS-COV-2 vaccine (AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer) in Kinshasa.
This was a prospective study recruiting 918 subjects vaccinated at the Cliniques Universitaires de Kinshasa between 19 April and 14 August 2021. Sociodemographic, haematological, biochemical and serological data were collected. Cox proportional hazards were used to identify predictors of seroconversion with a threshold of p < 0.05.
Of the 918 vaccinated individuals, 69.3% were men with a mean age of 47.4 ± 16.0 years. The incidence of seroconversion at last follow-up was 3.00 per 100 P-D. Patients receiving Pfizer (aRR: 3.19; 95% CI: 2.62-3.88) and Modern (aRR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.60-2.29) vaccines, men (aRR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.89-3.20), those with comorbidities (aRR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.89-3.21); subjects with normal creatinine (aRR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.88-3.32) and normal ALT (aRR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.89-4.22) were the factors independently predicting seroconversion.

On the basis of our previous attention to red blood cell distribution width (RDW), this study aimed to investigate the correlation between RDW and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.
Patients who underwent elective radical resection of pancreatic tumors from January 2017 to June 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Relevant clinical data were collected to evaluate the correlation between preoperative absolute RDW changes and post-pancreatectomy haemorrhage and clinical outcomes.
A total of 2268 patients were analyzed. We found that the preoperative RDW, preoperative LMR, anesthesia method, operation method, preoperative jaundice, operation with NSAIDs, and intravenous administration in patients with PDAC were significantly correlated with the infusion of albumin and R colloidal/crystal and post-pancreatectomy haemorrhage (PPH). In addition, sensitivity analysis revealed that preoperative RDW was associated with 30-day survival (P = 0.026), whereas PPH had a significant effect on in-hospital outcomes (P = 0.002), 30-day outcomes (P < 0.001) and 90-day outcomes (P < 0.001).

A subgroup analysis of the IMbrave150 trial showed shorter overall survival (OS) in uHCC patients with stable disease (SD) than patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Improving OS in patients with SD is an unmet medical need. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) may enhance treatment efficacy by controlling intrahepatic lesions and activating anti-tumor immunity. The IMPACT study aims to evaluate whether combining atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with TACE improves OS in patients with SD.
IMPACT is a multicenter, phase 3 study being conducted in Japan, recruiting uHCC patients aged ≥ 18 years with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A (single tumor ≥ 5 cm only, TACE unsuitable), stage B (TACE unsuitable) or stage C (excluding Vp3 or 4), Child-Pugh A liver function, and no prior systemic therapy. After 12 weeks of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment as induction therapy, patients are being divided into two cohorts based on response: a randomized cohort for patients who achieve SD, or an atezolizumab plus bevacizumab followed by curative conversion (ABC-conversion) cohort for patients who achieve CR or PR. Patients in the randomized cohort are receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and intrahepatic control TACE (Group A), or continuing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Group B). Patients in the ABC-conversion cohort are receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. All cohorts can be considered for curative conversion therapies for residual tumors if these therapies are considered curative, in the patient's best interests, and deemed necessary by the investigator. The primary endpoint is OS for the randomized cohort and conversion rate for the ABC-conversion cohort. Secondary endpoints in both cohorts include progression-free survival, objective response rate, duration of response, time to CR, and safety. The study is expected to last 6.5 years from June 2023.
IMPACT is evaluating the efficacy of combination therapy with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and TACE, as well as exploring the efficacy of curative conversion therapy. The results should contribute to establishing a response-guided treatment strategy for uHCC by determining optimal treatment according to the therapeutic effect of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.

40069613,Effects of community-based rehabilitation on caregivers of people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia in the RISE trial.,"Caregivers, Community mental health services, Community-based rehabilitation, Psychosocial intervention, Randomized controlled trial, Schizophrenia",BMC psychiatry,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition with high impact on those affected and their families. Community-based rehabilitation (CBR) is a recommended treatment component for schizophrenia in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), as it seeks to address complex social, health and economic needs. There is little evidence on the effects of CBR on caregivers of people with schizophrenia. RISE, conducted in Ethiopia, was the first randomised controlled trial of CBR for schizophrenia in a low-income country. In this paper, we extend our previous examination of caregiver impact by (1) investigating the impact of CBR on caregiver stigma and burden, (2) assessing effect modification of outcomes, and (3) determining predictors of caregiver outcomes at 12 months.
Data are from the cluster-randomised controlled RISE trial, which investigated CBR and facility-based care versus facility-based care alone among 166 people with schizophrenia and 166 linked caregivers in 48 sub-districts in Ethiopia. We analyse the effect of CBR on caregiver stigma, unemployment and burden measured with the WHO Family Interview Schedule-Impact at 6 and 12 months; and caregiver depression, reduction in work due to caregiving and caregiver burden measured with the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire at 6 months. Logistic and linear regression models adjusted for clustering by sub-district and health centre were used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Effect modification by caregiver sex, age, baseline of the outcome, and baseline disability were assessed. Baseline factors associated with caregiver outcomes across the whole cohort at 12 months were investigated using hierarchal regression modelling.
Data were available for 112 caregivers at 6 months (67%), and 149 caregivers at 12 months (90%). There was evidence that CBR was associated with greater tendency to reduce work due to caregiving at 6 months (OR:2.40, 95%CI:1.06-5.45). No evidence of an intervention effect was found on unemployment, depression, stigma or other aspects of caregiver burden. There was no evidence for effect modification. Higher baseline disability was independently associated with greater caregiving burden at 12 months (β:0.26, 95%CI:0.14-0.37).
There appeared to be no positive intervention effect of CBR on caregiver stigma, unemployment and burden in this analysis. Improving the outcomes of caregivers of people with schizophrenia in LMIC requires interventions and research addressing the needs of caregivers, for instance by integrating social and livelihoods interventions.

40069593,Preparedness for care transitions to home and acute care use of skilled nursing facility patients.,"Care transitions, Caregivers, Moderation, Older adults, Preparedness for discharge, Skilled nursing facilities",BMC geriatrics,"The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) describe the relationship between patient or caregiver reported preparedness for care transitions, and acute care use in 30 days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility (SNF); and (2) explore how this relationship is influenced by patient, Charlson index, race and social determinants.
The design was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a cluster randomized trial of the Connect-Home transitional care intervention. The setting was 6 skilled nursing facilities located in the US state of North Carolina. The sample was 249 patient and caregiver dyads with acute care use data (i.e., emergency department or hospital readmission) in 30 days after transfers from SNFs to home. Preparedness for care transitions was measured with the Care Transitions Measure-15 (CTM-15), a 15 item Likert scaled measure with scores potentially ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better preparedness. The association of preparedness and acute care use, in the overall study sample and within subgroups defined by five selected dyad background characteristics, was quantified as an incident rate ratio corresponding to the multiplicative change in the mean number of acute care use days for a 10 unit increase in CTM-15 score, using marginalized zero-inflated negative binomial regression.
Patients had a mean age of 76.4 years, 63.8% were female, and 73.6% were White. Caregivers were female (73.6%) and adult children (42.3%). The mean CTM-15 score was 72.9 and the mean days of acute care use in 30 days after SNF discharge was 0.62. For a 10 unit increase in preparedness score, among male patients the mean number of acute care use days decreased by 33% (IRR = 0.67; 95%CI: 0.44, 0.99); White patients had a 25% reduction (IRR = 0.75; 95%CI: 0.55, 1.02), patients with low area deprivation score (lower quartile, ADI = 54) had a 31% reduction in acute care use (IRR = 0.69; 95%CI: 0.47, 1.01), and patients with a high Charlson total score (upper quartile of 9) have a 22% reduction in acute care use (IRR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.02).
Preparedness of care transitions is an important outcome of high-quality SNF care and is associated with reduced use of further acute care. More research is necessary to evaluate the CTM-15 as an outcome measure among sociodemographic subgroups.","The design was a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a cluster randomized trial of the Connect-Home transitional care intervention.

There is growing interest in intravenous (IV) peptides and amino acids as potential therapeutic options for ED treatment.
This narrative review examines recent developments in peptide and amino acid therapies for ED, focusing on PT-141, PnPP-19, L-arginine, and L-citrulline. The literature search utilized PubMed to identify relevant English-language publications up to October 2024, emphasizing studies from the past decade.
IV peptides and amino acids offer promising therapeutic options for ED through mechanisms of action distinct from PED5 inhibitors. PT-141 and PnPP-19 show efficacy through central nervous system activation and nitric oxide regulation, while L-arginine and L-citrulline enhance endothelial function. Although evidence suggests potential benefits, large-scale clinical trials are needed to establish safety profiles, optimal dosing regimens, and possible synergistic effects with existing ED treatments.",,,,,10.1080/14656566.2025.2478912,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Ila', 'firstname': 'Vishal', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pozzi', 'firstname': 'Edoardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.\nIRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gamage', 'firstname': 'Miyuru', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Jumeirah American Clinic, Dubai, UAE.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramasamy', 'firstname': 'Ranjith', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Jumeirah American Clinic, Dubai, UAE.'}"

The study explored the effectiveness of brivaracetam (BRV) in people with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
BRIVAracetam add-on First Italian netwoRk Study (BRIVAFIRST) was a 12-month retrospective, multicenter study including adults prescribed adjunctive BRV. Main outcomes included the rates of seizure-freedom, seizure response (≥ 50% reduction in baseline seizure frequency), and treatment discontinuation. The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was also considered. Analyses by the presence and severity of intellectual disability were performed.
Subjects with intellectual disability were 253 (24.6%) out of 1029 participants. The 12-month rates of seizure freedom were 18.4% and 10.3% in participants without and with intellectual disability, respectively; the corresponding values for seizure response were 40.0% and 28.9%. Intellectual disability was not an independent predictor of seizure outcomes. The rates of treatment discontinuation were 25.8% and 26.4% in participants without and with intellectual disability. respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of any AEs, somnolence, nervousness/agitation, and aggressiveness by the presence and degree of intellectual disability.

40069523,A systematic review of reviews on ventriculostomy related infection definitions: A fundamental problem.,"Definition, EVD, External ventricular drain, Meningitis, VRI, Ventriculitis, Ventriculostomy related infection",Neurosurgical review,"Despite being a common, well-recognized and important complication to External Ventricular Drainage (EVD), a consensus definition for Ventriculostomy Related Infections (VRI) has not yet been established. We conducted a review to qualitatively assess definition heterogeneity and objectivity among Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs); and investigated systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and reviews of the literature for definition citation accuracy and common methodological approaches and points of discussion related to VRI definitions. RCTs were grouped into arbitrarily chosen infection rate brackets to examine the hypothesized correlation between broader definitions and higher infection rates in RCTs. A literature search was conducted via Ovid in the Embase, MedLine and Cochrane databases from all years until the 8th of January 2025. Using Covidence, two authors (MH, AA) independently evaluated records, including studies that had ≥ 1 VRI definitions and numerical VRI rates. We identified 12 definitions in 13 RCTs, documenting pronounced disagreement. Cumulative rates for ""definitive"" VRI (8.4%) were lower than ""suspected"" VRI (13.5%). Qualitatively assessed, studies with narrow definitions presented lower VRI rates. All 17/17 meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and 15/19 literature reviews cited ≥ 1 definition inaccurately. Trial results may change based on definition choice. Definition heterogeneity was not sufficiently accounted for in meta-analyses. All literature-based studies were confounded by definition heterogeneity. Previously reported findings based on meta-analytical methodologies may be invalid, and inaccurately presented definitions could give a false impression of trial comparability. A consensus set of definitions are necessary to allow comparison between studies, and should be constructed to account for the intended use since sensitivity and specificity may have different weight depending on the context.",,,,"© 2025.

The aim of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of a digital therapeutic (DT) versus German standard care through a prospective, randomized, multicenter controlled trial.
Study participants were recruited in 9 orthopedic specialist centers diagnosed with anterior knee pain and a NPRS score of ≥ 4. Stratified randomization for n = 140 participants was conducted, assigning participants to the intervention group (exclusive use of DT) or the control group (standard care). Standard care included 1-3 prescriptions for physical therapy, while the DT consisted of a 90-day personalized exercise therapy program including educational content. The primary endpoints were pain measured by NPRS and functional impairment measured by the Kujala Score.
The use of the DT compared to the standard care showed an improvement in clinical outcomes (NPRS = - 3.7 ± 2.67 and Kujala = 18.00 ± 13.96, both p < 0.001). Both pain and function improved clinically and statistically significantly compared to the control group (ANOVA: NPRS = - 1.64 ± 0.35, p < 0.001, Kujala = 9.26 ± 2.52, p < 0.01).
The use of the DT showed significant improvements in pain and function compared to the current standard therapy.

40069407,Fractional carbon dioxide laser treatment of hypertrophic scar clinical and histopathological evaluation.,"Fractional carbon dioxide laser, Hypertrophic scar",Lasers in medical science,"Hypertrophic scar could be associated with several complications that interfere with patient daily activities, physical and psychological health and impact patient quality of life. Several therapeutics and maneuvers are used for treatment of hypertrophic scar with variable success and side effects. We aim to evaluate safety and efficacy of fractional carbon dioxide laser on treatment of hypertrophic scar both clinically and histopathologically. Hypertrophic scars in each patient of total thirty patients were subjected to random division with sealed envelope into two parts, part A treated with fractional carbon dioxide laser every month for 5 sessions, and part B lift without treatment for control. Hypertrophic scars in each patient were single or multiple, Single scar was more than 15 cm length. Clinical evaluation was done by two blinded dermatologists, using Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) for each part before, 3 months and 6 months after treatment. Histopathological evaluation was done for each part before and 3 months after treatment by measuring epidermal thickness, collagen area percent, and elastin area percent. The upper significant clinical and histopathological improvement was shown in carbon dioxide laser treated parts than control parts without significant side effects for fractional carbon dioxide laser treatment. Treatment of hypertrophic scar with fractional carbon dioxide laser is beneficial and generally considered safe, with minimal risk of harm when performed with appropriate laser parameters for male and female patients with skin type III and IV, at different ages and different body regions.",,,,© 2025.

40069402,A phase II trial of mTORC1/2 inhibition in STK11 deficient non small cell lung cancer.,,NPJ precision oncology,"There are no current stratified medicine options for STK11-deficient NSCLC. STK11 loss mediates mTORC activation, GLUT1 up-regulation and increased glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming might represent a therapeutic vulnerability targetable with mTORC1/2 inhibition. In arm B2 of the National Lung Matrix Trial 54 patients with NSCLC received vistusertib, of which 49 were STK11-deficient (30 with KRAS mutation (B2D), 19 without (B2S)). Objective response (OR) and durable clinical benefit (DCB) rates with 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated from posterior probability distributions generated using Bayesian beta-binomial conjugate analysis. In B2D, 2 per-protocol patients obtained OR (estimated true OR rate (95%CrI) 9.8% (2.4-24.3). Estimates of true DCB rate (95%CrI): B2D 24.4% (11.1-42.3), B2S 14.6% (3.6-34.7). Overall, vistusertib cannot be recommended in this context. Longitudinal ctDNA analysis demonstrates enrichment of SMARCA4 mutations post-treatment. In vitro studies show adaptive resistance to mTORC1/2 inhibition via AKT reactivation. (NCT02664935, ISRCTN38344105, EudraCT 2014-000814-73, 10 June 2015).",,,,© 2025.

40069372,The sagitta in 3D reconstruction of linea alba on routine CT scans is predictive of postoperative burst abdomen.,"3D morphometrics, Burst abdomen, Linea alba, Sagitta",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,"Burst abdomen (BA) is a relevant complication after abdominal surgery that causes additional surgical procedures, prolonged hospital stays and long-term morbidity. Several underlying risk factors exist and have been characterized previously. Those risk factors consist of surgical and medical factors. Recently, CT-derived body composition is of rising interest and 3D reconstruction of the linea alba has been studied. The clinical significance of those parameters is not clear. We therefore performed an analysis of linea alba 3D reconstruction measurements and their prognostic significance on the development of BA.
An institutional data base of patients with post operative wound infections was assembled. The subgroup of patients with BA was compared to controls. If the patients had complete preoperative abdominal CT scans, their images were further analyzed and 3D reconstruction of the linea alba was performed. Subsequently, lineal alba was measured at predetermined positions. Those values were evaluated as risk factors for postoperative BA.
A total of 72 patients with BA and 32 controls were eligible for the analysis. We found body mass index-related significant differences as well as sex related differences in linea alba width. Furthermore, BA patients had a significantly wider linea alba and longer sagitta compared to controls. In the multivariate analysis of linea alba measurements and clinical parameters, the length of the sagitta was significantly associated with the risk of BA (OR 1.266; 95% CI 1.011-1.585; p = 0.04).
In this study of 3D reconstruction of the linea alba from routine CT scans, we could show that a longer sagitta was associated with an increased risk of postoperative BA.",,"A total of 72 patients with BA and 32 controls were eligible for the analysis.

A 1:1 randomized controlled trial was conducted. A SPM consisting of six surgical steps was defined to represent the surgical procedure. The primary outcome, termed ""deviation"" measured the difference between actual and planned surgery duration. Secondary outcomes included stress levels of the operating team and complications. Analyses employed Welch t-tests and linear regression models.
18 procedures were performed with a SWMS and 18 without. The deviation showed no significant difference between the intervention and control group. Stress levels (TLX score) of the team remained largely unaffected. Duration of operation steps defined by SPM allows a classification of all liver procedures into three phases: The Start Phase (low IQR of operation time), the Main Phase (high IQR of operation time) and the End Phase (low IQR of operation time).

40069213,An Evaluation Benchmark for Adverse Drug Event Prediction from Clinical Trial Results.,,Scientific data,"Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a major safety issue in clinical trials. Thus, predicting ADEs is key to developing safer medications and enhancing patient outcomes. To support this effort, we introduce CT-ADE, a dataset for multilabel ADE prediction in monopharmacy treatments. CT-ADE encompasses 2,497 drugs and 168,984 drug-ADE pairs from clinical trial results, annotated using the MedDRA ontology. Unlike existing resources, CT-ADE integrates treatment and target population data, enabling comparative analyses under varying conditions, such as dosage, administration route, and demographics. In addition, CT-ADE systematically collects all ADEs in the study population, including positive and negative cases. To provide a baseline for ADE prediction performance using the CT-ADE dataset, we conducted analyses using large language models (LLMs). The best LLM achieved an F1-score of 56%, with models incorporating treatment and patient information outperforming by 21%-38% those relying solely on the chemical structure. These findings underscore the importance of contextual information in ADE prediction and establish CT-ADE as a robust resource for safety risk assessment in pharmaceutical research and development.",,,,© 2025.

However, the results of clinical trials on the effectiveness of CCBs have been conflicting. Here, we systematically reviewed previous studies to investigate the potential factors that could act as therapeutic modifiers and explain these discrepancies. This systematic review was conducted employing the PRISMA guideline to retrieve clinical trials and animal studies investigating the efficacy of CCBs. Studies in the following databases were collected: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinical Trials, Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Keywords included the trade and generic names of various CCBs, thalassemia, and cardiomyopathy. Our Primary search resulted in 297 studies, of which 21 (n = 7 trials and n = 14 animal studies) were further analyzed. The most important parameters that could potentially influence the clinical effectiveness of CCBs in managing iron-induced cardiomyopathy included baseline cardiac iron content, diversity of iron entry routes (LTCCs, TTCCs, DMT-1, etc.), type of CCBs used, iron-induced irreversible functional/structural cardiac changes, iron-Ca",,,,,10.1080/03630269.2025.2470718,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Bazi', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Khanahmad', 'firstname': 'Alireza', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.\nStudent Research Committee, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Khazaee-Nasirabadi', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Hossein', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.\nStudent Research Committee, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pirouzbakht', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghorbani Biregani', 'firstname': 'Kobra', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Peymaninezhad', 'firstname': 'Fatemeh', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mirzaee Khalilabadi', 'firstname': 'Roohollah', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hematology and Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}"

While all cases of IgAN show dominant or codominant glomerular IgA deposits, their histologic appearance can range from essentially normal to severe crescentic GN. Oxford (MEST-C) scoring is widely used to classify IgAN on kidney biopsies and has been validated to correlate with clinical presentation and as an independent predictor of kidney outcomes in multiple studies. Components of MEST-C, most notably endocapillary hypercellularity (E score) and crescents (C score), have also been shown to correlate with response to immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, immunohistologic evidence of complement activation by the alternative pathway and sometimes the lectin pathway correlates with histologic lesions, proteinuria, and kidney survival, suggesting the complement cascade as a potential therapeutic target. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of newer classes of immunosuppressive agents as well as complement inhibitors to reduce proteinuria, a marker associated with disease progression, in patients with IgAN. While pathologic studies of kidney biopsies have generally not been part of these trials, this review presents an algorithm by which kidney biopsy findings can be used to guide the choice of therapeutic agents in patients with IgAN.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

40068926,Evaluating the impact of two next-generation long-lasting insecticidal nets on malaria incidence in Uganda: an interrupted time-series analysis using routine health facility data.,"Global Health, Malaria, Public Health",BMJ global health,"Malaria remains a significant public health challenge globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has stalled in recent years. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a critical preventive tool against malaria. This study investigated the effectiveness of newer-generation LLINs following a universal coverage campaign in Uganda.
Health facility data collected 36 months prior to LLIN distribution and 24 months after LLIN distribution were used from 64 sites that took part in a cluster-randomised trial comparing two newer-generation LLINs (pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen). Using an interrupted time-series approach, we compared observed malaria incidence with counterfactual scenarios if no LLINs were distributed, adjusting for precipitation, vegetation, seasonality and care-seeking behaviour. Analyses were also stratified by LLIN type and study-site level estimates of transmission intensity.
Overall, malaria incidence decreased from 827 cases per 1000 person-years in the predistribution period to 538 per 1000 person-years in the postdistribution period. Interrupted time-series analyses estimated a 23% reduction in malaria incidence (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the first 12 months following distribution relative to what would be expected had no distribution occurred, which was not sustained in the 13-24 month post-distribution period (IRR=0.97, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Findings were similar when stratified by LLIN type. In the first 12 months following distribution, LLIN effectiveness was greater in the high-transmission sites (IRR=0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86) compared with the medium- (IRR=0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92) and low-transmission sites (IRR=0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.32).
This study demonstrated a modest reduction in malaria incidence following the distribution of newer-generation LLINs that was sustained for only 12 months, highlighting the need for improved strategies to maintain net effectiveness. Adjusting the frequency of universal coverage campaigns based on local malaria transmission intensity may enhance control efforts.",,"Overall, malaria incidence decreased from 827 cases per 1000 person-years in the predistribution period to 538 per 1000 person-years in the postdistribution period.

40068892,Risk factors for flap loss in midface reconstruction with vascularized fibular flap.,,Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,"Midface reconstruction should address both functional and cosmetic aspects. The vascularized fibular osteomyocutaneous flap (VFOF) is a promising first choice because of its numerous advantages in this type of reconstruction.
This study aimed to investigate the causes of VFOF failure during midface reconstruction. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent midface defect reconstruction using VFOF from August 2011 to May 2022 at a single center. The primary outcome variable was VFOF loss within 30 days, and secondary outcomes included late complications related to VFOF occurring at least 6 months postoperatively.
A total of 62 patients underwent VFOF reconstruction for midface defects. The VFOF technique was primarily used in 56 (90.3%) patients for initial reconstruction. Most reconstructions were performed for Class III (77.4%) and Class b (83.6%) defects, according to the Brown and Shaw classification. Skin paddles of the VFOF were used in 51 (82.3%) patients, and a double flap technique utilizing the fibular was employed in 24 (38.7%) patients. VFOF failure occurred in 10 (16.1%) patients. Prognostic factors associated with VFOF failure included sex (P = 0.01) and maxillary Brown and Shaw classification (horizontal) (P = 0.01). Long-term follow-up of 47 patients revealed late complications in 11 (23.4%) patients, and diabetes mellitus was identified as a significant risk factor (P < 0.01).
The VFOF is suitable for midface defect reconstruction; however, proper placement of the fibular bone, avoiding pedicle vessel kinking, ensuring tension-free vascular anastomosis during surgery, considering adding another flap in addition to the fibula flap for large defects, and diligent postoperative nasal care are essential.",,"A total of 62 patients underwent VFOF reconstruction for midface defects.

The benefits of water aerobics (WAs) have been shown in obesity and overweight people, but the effects of WAs on body composition improvement are still unclear.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
A systematic literature search was conducted on 16 November 2024, across the PubMed MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library.
Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included, which were independently screened by two researchers. All RCTs on WAs that evaluated the anthropometric and body composition parameters of overweight and obesity subjects were included. Eligible studies were reported following the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement.
All process were independently screened by two researchers (ZD, HZ). A fixed-effects or random-effects model was chosen based on the heterogeneity of the studies. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias V.2.0 tool, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted for outcome indicators. The quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.
A total of 10 studies involving 286 participants were included. Sensitivity analyses were performed for percent body fat (PBF) with high heterogeneity, and the results were robust. WAs were able to reduce body weight (BW) (weighted mean differences (WMD)=-2.69, 95% CI -4.10 to -1.27, p<0.05, I
For the obesity and overweight people, WAs interventions over 10 weeks (ie, 12 weeks) reduced BW and WC, with more significant effects in women and greater improvements in body composition in middle-aged and older adults (average age ≥45 years). The moderate certainty of evidence for BW and WC, as assessed using the GRADE framework, indicates that these findings are robust.

40068721,Artificial intelligence in stroke rehabilitation: From acute care to long-term recovery.,"Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neurorehabilitation, Robotics, Stroke Rehabilitation, Tele-Rehabilitation",Neuroscience,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide, driving the need for advanced rehabilitation strategies. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into stroke rehabilitation presents significant advancements across the continuum of care, from acute diagnosis to long-term recovery. This review explores AI's role in stroke rehabilitation, highlighting its impact on early diagnosis, motor recovery, and cognitive rehabilitation. AI-driven imaging techniques, such as deep learning applied to CT and MRI scans, improve early diagnosis and identify ischemic penumbra, enabling timely, personalized interventions. AI-assisted decision support systems optimize acute stroke treatment, including thrombolysis and endovascular therapy. In motor rehabilitation, AI-powered robotics and exoskeletons provide precise, adaptive assistance, while AI-augmented Virtual and Augmented Reality environments offer immersive, tailored recovery experiences. Brain-Computer Interfaces utilize AI for neurorehabilitation through neural signal processing, supporting motor recovery. Machine learning models predict functional recovery outcomes and dynamically adjust therapy intensities. Wearable technologies equipped with AI enable continuous monitoring and real-time feedback, facilitating home-based rehabilitation. AI-driven tele-rehabilitation platforms overcome geographic barriers by enabling remote assessment and intervention. The review also addresses the ethical, legal, and regulatory challenges associated with AI implementation, including data privacy and technical integration. Future research directions emphasize the transformative potential of AI in stroke rehabilitation, with case studies and clinical trials illustrating the practical benefits and efficacy of AI technologies in improving patient recovery.",,,,Copyright © 2025.

40068714,Rationale and Design of the ILIAS ANOCA Clinical Trial: a blinded-arm controlled trial for routine ad-hoc coronary function testing.,"Angina with non-obstructive coronary arteries, coronary function testing, coronary vasomotor dysfunction",American heart journal,"Angina with non-obstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA) is a major cause of chronic coronary syndromes, affecting nearly half of patients with anginal symptoms who undergo invasive coronary angiography. ANOCA may lead to substantial symptom burden, increased risk of adverse cardiac events, increased healthcare utilization due to ongoing symptoms, repeat hospitalizations, and invasive testing. The pathophysiology of ANOCA often involves a variety of coronary disorders, such as coronary microvascular dysfunction, epicardial or microvascular vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction. While coronary function testing (CFT) can identify each of these specific endotypes, in current practice it is used as a second- or third-line diagnostic tool, delaying diagnosis which contributes to persistent symptoms and diminished quality of life. The ILIAS ANOCA clinical trial aims to enhance understanding and management of ANOCA through early routine CFT-guided management. After exclusion of obstructive coronary artery disease, eligible patients undergo comprehensive CFT, and will be randomized to blinding of the CFT results (control group) or disclosure of the CFT results combined with a tailored medical therapy escalation plan (intervention group). The control group will be unblinded after one year. The primary outcome is the mean difference in the within-subject change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) summary score between the groups at 6 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes include differences in SAQ-summary score and additional health-status and quality of life questionnaires at 12 and 24 months from baseline.

40068707,"Host-directed therapy in diabetes and tuberculosis comorbidity, towards global TB elimination.",,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,"Host-directed therapy could potentially revolutionise tuberculosis control, as adjunct to traditional antibiotics for the treatment of tuberculosis disease, and as a strategy to prevent disease progression following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The growing type 2 diabetes pandemic is hampering tuberculosis control worldwide, as people with diabetes have an increased risk of developing tuberculosis disease as well as worse treatment outcomes. Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterised by an inflammatory response which can cause alveolar tissue destruction and cavitation, and this inflammation is exacerbated in people with tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity. Thus, the reduction of the inflammatory response is a key goal of host-directed therapy to dampen immunopathology, but it is vital that the inflammatory response is not suppressed too much or the immune system will not be able to react to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterial replication will intensify. Furthermore, the type I interferon response and host cell metabolism are further dysregulated in tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity, likely contributing to poor treatment outcomes. Achieving the right balance in terms of modulating the inflammatory and immune responses, both quantitatively and temporally, is more complex in tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity and this population should be included specifically in clinical trials of new regimen. In this regard, mathematical modelling has a key role in elucidating which biological pathways should be targeted in different people. Host-directed therapy for people with tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidity will reduce immunopathology and post-tuberculosis lung disease, as well as boost microbiological cure and treatment outcomes, and thus help in the fight towards global tuberculosis elimination.",,,,Copyright © 2025.

Smartphone apps offer a cost-efficient method to deliver content to families.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UseIt! mobile health system as both stand-alone and coach-assisted interventions via a randomized controlled trial. The UseIt! System is designed to reduce disruptive behaviors in young children.
A nationwide sample of parents of children aged 5 years to 8 years with disruptive behaviors (N=324 dyads) are randomly assigned to the stand-alone app (UseIt!; n=108), the coach-assisted app (UseIt! plus supportive accountability; n=108), or the control app (mindfulness app; n=108). The UseIt! App provides parents with tools and troubleshooting to address disruptive behaviors, along with a behavior diary to track behaviors and strategies over time. The coach-assisted condition includes a bachelor's level paraprofessional who provides weekly phone calls to promote engagement with the app. The control condition is composed of a mindfulness app. The web-based, self-assessed outcome measures (post treatment and 6-month follow-up) include measures of app usage, parenting knowledge (eg, knowledge of parent management training and cognitive behavioral therapy skills), and strategies (use of evidence-based parenting strategies), symptom reduction (eg, behavior problems), and parent mental health (eg, anxiety, stress, and depression). We hypothesize that both intervention conditions will show greater parent knowledge and use of skills along with greater symptom reduction relative to the control condition. Further, we hypothesize that those assigned to the coach assisted condition will report greater knowledge, skill use, and symptom reduction than the stand-alone app. We will use intent-to-treat analyses to regress outcomes on study conditions to evaluate for differences across conditions.
Recruitment of study participants began in December of 2022 and is ongoing. We have recruited over half of our intended sample of 324 parent-child dyads (n=214) as of December 2024. These dyads have been randomly allocated to each of the intervention conditions, with 71 assigned to the coach-assisted condition, 72 assigned to the stand-alone app, and 71 assigned to the control app condition. Data collection is projected to be completed by late 2026.
The current study aims to address a gap in the literature regarding the feasibility, effectiveness, and utility of a smartphone app that includes a coach-assisted arm. Digital therapeutics have the potential to enhance the reach and scalability of skills-based psychosocial interventions. Findings from this study will advance scientific knowledge and have implications for clinical practice.

40068486,Co-occurring impairments in several domains of memory following neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy have real-life implications.,"Memory function, Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, School-age outcomes, Therapeutic hypothermia",European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,"Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy (HIE) increases the risk for neurodevelopmental impairment. Information on school-age memory function is limited in children who received hypothermia treatment (TH) for neonatal HIE.
To evaluate memory function in school-aged children who had neonatal HIE and TH and survived without major neuromotor impairment.
Fifty-one children with neonatal HIE and 41 typically developing (TD) peers participated. At age 6-8 years general cognitive abilities (FSIQ) were assessed with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), immediate and delayed visual and verbal memory with Children's Memory Scale (CMS), everyday memory with Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test for Children (RBMT-C), and working memory with WISC-V. Real-life implications were assessed with Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Function (BRIEF; Parent and Teacher). Group differences were examined and correlations calculated to assess associations between memory measures. Relationship maps illustrate co-occurring impairments.
FSIQ was in the normal range for both groups but significantly lower in the HIE group.

To investigate the feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial comparing Palin STSC(8-14) with usual treatment. Objectives were to establish: recruitment and retention rates; appropriateness of the outcome measures; acceptability of the research and Palin STSC(8-14) therapy; treatment fidelity; and, appropriateness of the cost-effectiveness measures.
A two-arm, cluster-randomised trial, with randomisation of therapists, stratified by service. Children aged 8;0-14;11, and their parent(s), were allocated to therapist and completed questionnaires pre-therapy and six months later. Assessments were selected for their potential to measure or predict therapy outcome. Therapists completed measures at the start and end of the trial. A process analysis was conducted, incorporating semi-structured interviews and treatment fidelity examination.
Recruitment targets were exceeded (Children n = 67; SLTs n = 37). Research processes were largely acceptable, as was Palin STSC(8-14) therapy.

40068270,Probiotics for the treatment of hyperlipidemia: Focus on gut-liver axis and lipid metabolism.,"Gut metabolites, Gut-liver axis, Hyperlipidemia, Lipid metabolism, Probiotics",Pharmacological research,"Hyperlipidemia, a metabolic disorder marked by dysregulated lipid metabolism, is a key contributor to the onset and progression of various chronic diseases. Maintaining normal lipid metabolism is critical for health, as disruptions lead to dyslipidemia. The gut and liver play central roles in lipid homeostasis, with their bidirectional communication, known as the gut-liver axis, modulated by bile acids (BAs), gut microbiota, and their metabolites. BAs are essential for regulating their own synthesis, lipid metabolism, and anti-inflammatory responses, primarily through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5). Available evidence suggests that high-fat diet-induced the gut microbiota dysbiosis can induce ""leaky gut,"" allowing toxic microbial metabolites to enter the liver via portal circulation, triggering liver inflammation and lipid metabolism disturbances, ultimately leading to hyperlipidemia. Extensive studies have highlighted the roles of probiotics and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in restoring gut-liver axis balance and modulating lipid metabolism through regulating the levels of lipopolysaccharides, short-chain fatty acids, and BAs. However, the therapeutic potential of probiotics and TCM for hyperlipidemia remains unclear. Here, firstly, we explore the intricate interplay among gut microbiota and metabolites, lipid metabolism, gut-liver axis, and hyperlipidemia. Secondly, we summarize the mechanisms by which probiotics and TCM can alleviate hyperlipidemia by altering the composition of gut microbiota and regulating lipid metabolism via the gut-liver axis. Finally, we emphasize that more clinical trials of probiotics and TCM are necessary to examine their effects on lipid metabolism and hyperlipidemia.",,,,Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

40068246,Aging and senescence: Key players in brain tumor progression and drug resistance.,"Aging, Autophagy, GBM, Genetic Alterations & Immunological changes, Synaptic Plasticity, Therapeutic interventions, miRNA",Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,"Aging plays a critical role in the development, progression, and therapeutic challenges associated with brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas (GBM). As the population ages, the incidence of brain tumors, including GBM, increases, with aging emerging as a significant prognostic factor influencing survival outcomes. This review examines the molecular mechanisms linking aging and brain tumor progression, with a specific focus on glioblastomas. We explore how age-related genetic mutations, alterations in cellular pathways, and changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, p53, and EGFR/PTEN, which are frequently dysregulated in both aging and brain tumors. Despite the growing recognition of aging as a critical factor in brain tumor biology, therapeutic strategies for elderly patients remain poorly defined, often due to underrepresentation in clinical trials and the complex interplay of comorbidities and treatment side effects. The review also discusses emerging therapeutic approaches, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, which offer promise for improving treatment outcomes by addressing age-related molecular changes. Finally, we emphasize the importance of personalized treatment strategies and the need for further research to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying the aging-brain tumor relationship, ultimately aiming to enhance clinical management and patient quality of life.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Most national and regional guidelines recommend first-line therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (with or without chemotherapy) or a cetuximab-based regimen, by assessment of expression levels of the biomarker programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). However, patient- and tumor-specific factors, including the patient's age, comorbidities, performance status, and tumor burden, kinetics and spread also need to be considered to optimize treatment in the first line. Additionally, with increasing availability of newer therapies globally, it is crucial to customize the subsequent second- or later-line therapy based on patient characteristics, including the previous therapy received. This review highlights the factors that should be considered for treatment decision-making in patients with R/M SCCHN.

Delayed cessation of synkinesis is a major factor impeding hemiplegic recovery; however, effective rehabilitation for acute synkinesis has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a novel treatment using a low-frequency therapeutic device for the cessation of synkinesis in patients with incomplete paralysis and cerebrovascular disease.
Single-arm, open-label study.
The study included patients aged ≥20 years with incomplete paralysis of the upper limbs, defined as Brunnstrom stage 2 to 4, within 1 month of a cerebrovascular accident.
Patients underwent rehabilitation using a low-frequency therapy device for daily joint movements. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) of upper limbs 2 weeks after treatment initiation (Trial registration: Japanese Clinical Registry, jRCTs05218022; date of registration: February 1, 2022). Ten patients with cerebrovascular disease participated in this study.
The average duration was 6.4 ± 1.9 (range, 5.04-7.76) days, and the device caused no serious adverse events. Rehabilitation using this device significantly improved upper limb function.

40068080,Addressing post-COVID-19 musculoskeletal symptoms through pulmonary rehabilitation with an evidence-based eHealth education tool: Preliminary results from a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial.,,Medicine,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global health crisis with significant long-term consequences, including musculoskeletal symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, and chronic pain. These issues, often linked to altered nociceptive processing, impair quality of life and are exacerbated in severe cases by intensive care unit-acquired weakness from immobilization and mechanical ventilation. Early rehabilitation, particularly pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), is crucial for mitigating these effects. Telerehabilitation, leveraging telemedicine, offers an innovative, accessible alternative, providing personalized programs that improve adherence and recovery. Recent studies highlight telerehabilitation's benefits alongside traditional methods, underscoring its potential for managing post-COVID-19 musculoskeletal sequelae. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of PR and an eHealth education tool (ET) on pain, functionality, quality of life, and psychological factors in post-COVID-19 patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and to compare telerehabilitation versus face-to-face approaches regarding treatment adherence.
This pilot randomized controlled trial included 12 patients with musculoskeletal symptoms of COVID-19. The participants were randomly assigned to a PR program with or without an evidence-based eHealth ET. Primary outcomes included pain reduction and improvements in functional capacity, quality of life, and psychological factors measured over a 45-week period. The secondary outcome was adherence to rehabilitation.
A significant reduction in kinesiophobia was found in the eHealth ET group (P = .048), although no significant differences were observed in pain, Barthel index, or 6-minute walk test results between the groups. Clinically relevant improvements were observed in the telemedicine group.

40068075,Epidural volume extension versus dural puncture epidural analgesia for labor: A prospective randomized study.,,Medicine,"Providing effective labor analgesia is very important for maternal and infant safety. Various neuraxial techniques are used for this purpose. Our objective was to compare the epidural volume extension (EVE) and dural puncture epidural (DPE) procedures employed in clinical practice for labor analgesia, focusing on labor parameters, pain levels, fetal outcomes, and complications.
Sixty patients were randomized to EVE (n = 30) and DPE (n = 30). In the EVE group, 1 mL of a mixture containing a combination of 10 µg fentanyl and 0.25% isobaric bupivacaine was injected into the intrathecal region via a 25-G 120 mm Whitacre spinal needle. Then, 7.4 mL of 0.9% NaCl was injected into the epidural area. In the DPE group, after dural puncture with the same procedure, 20 mL of a mixture containing a combination of 2 µg/mL fentanyl and 0.125% isobaric bupivacaine was injected into the epidural area. Time of required the first top-up dose, numerical pain rating scale ≤ 1 and bilateral S2 block time, sensory block level, number of top-up doses required during labor, incidence of complications were recorded.
A total of 60 patients were analyzed. First top-up time-the primary outcome of the study, was similar between groups (76.45 ± 17.38 vs 88.20 ± 31.38, P = .067). Time to reach minimum pain score, numerical pain rating scale ≤ 1, bilateral S2 block time was significantly shorter in group EVE compared to group DPE. There was no statistical significance in terms of peak dermatome level and total number of administered top-ups, time to reach peak dermatome, incidence of complications.
While the EVE technique necessitates a reduced total volume of local anesthetic, it results in a more rapid ascent of the dermatomal level and a quicker reduction in pain scores; we believe that both strategies can be utilized effectively and safely for labor analgesia. However, randomized comparative studies with larger sample sizes are required to find the optimal strategy.",,"A total of 60 patients were analyzed.

An open, randomized clinical trial enrolled 170 patients with FM (2016 American College of Rheumatology criteria, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score ≥ 39) from 8 French pain centers, and compared Immediate versus Delayed therapy. Therapy was provided at inclusion (D0) and month three (M3) in the Immediate and Delayed groups respectively. Therapy in the Immediate group stopped from month six (M6) to month nine (M9). Randomization was stratified by center, and FM severity, allocation ratio was 1:1. The primary outcome compared the proportion of patients with a Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire reduction ≥ 14% (minimal clinically important difference), from D0 to M3 in both groups. Pain (Visual Analogic Scale), sleep (Pittsburg sleep quality index), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory Questionnaire), patients' and clinicians' impression of change (patient global impression of change & clinician global impression of change), physical activity (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), generic QoL (euroqol, 5 dimensions, 5 levels), pharmacological and complementary treatment intakes, and healthcare requirements were measured at M3, M6, and M9.

40068066,Unveiling the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese patent medicines: A network meta-analysis on chronic atrophic gastritis.,,Medicine,"The study aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese patent medicine (TCPM), either used alone or combined with conventional treatment (CT) of chemical drugs, for treating chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG).
We searched the literature from database creation to December 2023; our primary endpoint was clinical response rate. Secondary outcome measures were the inhibition rate of Helicobacter pylori and clinical symptom score, including pain and noisy scores for the stomach, score for belch and acid reflux, score for the bitter taste and the dry throat, and safety according to total adverse events. Data analyzed using RevMan 5.3, R (v4.0.2), and Stata SE 15.0. Mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes and drug ranking by P-score. Network meta-analysis presented as forest plot and league table. Results reported as MDs/ORs with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Our analysis comprised 49 RCTs with 5218 patients. Compared to using CT alone, all TCPMs + CT performed better in improving clinical response rate. The Weifuchun tablet (WFCT) inhibition rate (OR = 9.05; 95% CI = 1.89-43.34; P-score = .92) was relatively high, but only 1 RCT supported this result.

40068063,Which is more effective in hypertension?: Salt-free diet vs DASH diet.,,Medicine,"In the management of hypertension lifestyle changes are recommended along with pharmacological treatment.
This randomized controlled intervention study aimed to compare the effects of a dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and a salt-free diet on blood pressure in hypertension patients. This study was conducted with 60 patients with primary hypertension. One group (n = 30) was given an individualized DASH diet, the other group was given a salt-free diet (n = 30), and the participants were followed for 2-months. The patients' blood pressures were monitored daily throughout the study, and their biochemical parameters were monitored at the beginning of the study, in the first and second months.
At the end of the second month, there was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of diastolic blood pressure, while the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the salt-free diet group (121.03 ± 9.73 mm Hg) was statistically significantly lower than the DASH diet group (126.81 ± 8.91 mm Hg) (P = .021).
The salt-free diet was more efficient than for lowering SBP. However, the fact that sodium and soluble fiber intakes in the DASH diet group were higher than those in the salt-free diet group at the end of the first month, unlike at the beginning (P < .05), suggests that restricting the salt content of the DASH diet in hypertension could lead to more favorable outcomes on blood pressure, considering its suitability for a healthy diet.",,"At the end of the second month, there was no difference between the 2 groups in terms of diastolic blood pressure, while the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the salt-free diet group (121.03 ± 9.73 mm Hg) was statistically significantly lower than the DASH diet group (126.81 ± 8.91 mm Hg) (P = .021).","The salt-free diet was more efficient than for lowering SBP.

40068054,Comparing the effectiveness of dual-task and single-task training on walking function in stroke recovery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,,Medicine,"Stroke is a prevalent neurological disease with high morbidity and disability. Single-task walking training has limitations, and dual-task walking training has emerged. Yet, research on the relative effectiveness of dual- and single-task training for stroke patients' walking function is inconclusive. This study aims to systematically compare the efficacy of dual-task with single-task training interventions on improving walking function among stroke survivors.
A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the application of dual-task training on walking function in stroke patients. Two reviewers independently screened the references, selected relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The primary outcome measures related to walking function included step speed, step length, stride length, step frequency, Berg balance scale (BBS), and timed up and go (TUG) test. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for methodological quality assessment of the included literature. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Furthermore, the quality of evidence of the outcome measures was evaluated using the GRADEPro software.
A total of 17 studies were enrolled in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The results revealed that dual-task training exhibited significantly superior efficacy compared to single-task training in enhancing step speed, step length, stride length, step frequency, and BBS score (P < .05). However, no significant difference was observed in the TUG test (P = .100).
Compared with traditional single-task training, dual-task training could be more effective in improving walking function among stroke patients, especially with regard to temporal and spatial parameters such as step length and speed, stride frequency and BBS score, but the effect on enhancing TUG test still remains unclear. These findings would help clinicians to formulate a more rational stroke rehabilitation strategy.",,"A total of 17 studies were enrolled in this systematic review and meta-analysis.

40068036,Comprehensive evaluation of flumazenil adverse reactions: Insights from FAERS data and signal detection algorithms.,,Medicine,"This study aims to systematically evaluate the adverse reactions of flumazenil by analyzing data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), identifying and quantifying its potential risks across different system organ classifications. The research focuses on patients with long-term benzodiazepine use, aiming to provide more comprehensive safety guidance for clinical application and to support future pharmacovigilance policy development. This study utilized adverse event report data from the FAERS database, covering the period from 2004 to 2023. Multiple signal detection algorithms, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker, were employed to analyze and classify the adverse reaction signals of flumazenil. The study enhanced the sensitivity and accuracy of signal detection using advanced machine learning tools, and the findings were compared and validated against existing literature data. The results showed a significant association between flumazenil and neurological adverse reactions, such as ""withdrawal seizures"" (ROR 1737.25, PRR 1645.3) and ""psychogenic epilepsy"" (ROR 774.32, PRR 764.68), with higher risk particularly observed in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use. In addition, procedural complications, such as delayed emergence from anesthesia and intentional overdose, also exhibited notable signal strength. Although cardiovascular and respiratory adverse reactions were rare, rare risks such as stress-induced cardiomyopathy and respiratory depression still warrant attention. By integrating FAERS data and multiple signal detection algorithms, this study confirmed the potential high risk of flumazenil use in clinical practice, particularly concerning neurological adverse reactions.

40068032,Prophylactic efficacy of oral gabapentin on postoperative shivering: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,,Medicine,"Postoperative shivering may lead to severe side effects during postoperative care, particularly in patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function. The efficacy of oral gabapentin as a preventive strategy for postoperative shivering has not been quantitatively analyzed. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gabapentin as a drug for treating postoperative shivering.
A review of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase was conducted by 2 researchers for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In this meta-analysis, Review Manager was used to analyze these RCTs on oral gabapentin for postoperative shivering.
Six trials with 544 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Prophylactic oral gabapentin reduced postoperative shivering compared with placebo (pooled risk ratio [RR]: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25-0.57). The anti-shivering effect could be achieved after both general anesthesia (pooled RR of 3 trails: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.14-0.56) and orthopedic surgery (pooled RR of 4 trails: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.58). Meanwhile, gabapentin also could decrease postoperative vomiting (POV; pooled RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.77).
Our current meta-analysis shows that compared with placebo, oral gabapentin can reduce the incidence of postoperative shivering. This result also provides new evidence to strengthen the clinical application value of gabapentin in the conventional treatment of POV.

40068023,Comparison of different treatments of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,,Medicine,"This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of various treatments for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients using a network meta-analysis.
A systematic search was conducted on Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from their inception to January 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials comparing various treatments (epinephrine (high dose), vasopressin, epinephrine (standard dose), epinephrine + vasopressin) or placebo for OHCA patients. Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed, and data extraction and analysis were carried out using the R software with the gemtc package. The treatment options were ranked based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value.
Finally, a total of 18 studies (21,594 patients) were included in this network meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, epinephrine (high dose), vasopressin, epinephrine (standard dose), epinephrine + vasopressin all increase the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). Epinephrine (high dose) ranked first (SUCRA, 85.0%) for ROSC rate. Compared with placebo, epinephrine (high dos), vasopressin, epinephrine (standard dose), epinephrine + vasopressin all increase the ROSC rate, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). The SUCRA shows that vasopressin ranked first (SUCRA, 79.3%). Compared with placebo, epinephrine (high dose), vasopressin, epinephrine (standard dos), epinephrine + vasopressin all increase the survival to discharge, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05).

40067916,Lessons Learned Evaluating Ablative Fractional CO2 Laser for Burn-Related Donor Site Scars.,"burn scar, donor site, fractional ablative CO2 laser, hypertrophic scar",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,"Hypertrophic scar (HTS) remains a comorbidity of burn injury, often requiring split thickness skin grafting (STSG) and resulting in symptomatic HTS at grafted sites and STSG donor sites (DS). Literature supports the use of ablative fractional CO2 laser (FLSR) to treat HTS, however many trials lack of control sites and tissue-level examinations. Given the widespread adoption of FLSR for HTS, delegation of non-treated scar sites for the sake of randomized controlled trial (RCT) is troubling for many clinicians. We trialed using STSG DS scars for randomization rather than withholding FLSR from HTS at grafted sites. Patients (n=20) were treated for DS scar with FLSR. DS scars were randomized and treated with either 6 FLSR treatments, follow-ups, and standard of care (SOC) or SOC only. Prior to treatment, DS skin and normal skin (NS) were evaluated for trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), melanin index (MI), elasticity, and erythema. Serial biopsies were analyzed for epidermal thickness, rete ridge ratio (RRR), and papillary dermal cellularity. All sites, including a separate burn scar (BS) site, were evaluated using the patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS) -observer (-O), -patient (-P), Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), and an institutional Scar Comparison Scale (SCS). Prior to treatment, the DS control (DS C), DS treated (DS T), and BS sites were hyperpigmented compared to normal skin. BS was less elastic than all other sites and had increased TEWL compared to normal skin. DS skin had increased cellularity, decreased rete ridge ratios, and increased epidermal thickness compared to NS. Clinician observers and patients perceived the BS site as more severe versus DS skin through the POSAS-O, POSAS-P, and VSS. Over time, DS C and DS T sites were not different in TEWL, elasticity, erythema, MI, cellularity, RRR, epidermal thickness, POSAS-O scores, POSAS-P scores, VSS scores, or SCS scores. Over time, burn scar did not change in TEWL, elasticity, erythema, MI, POSAS-O scores, POSAS-P scores, and VSS scores. Decreased SCS scores within the DS C, DS T, and BS sites indicated patient-perceived improvement in all scars throughout the study time course. NS and DS skin possess inherent physiological differences, though not to the degree of burn scars vs. NS. FLSR may not alter the rate of maturation and remodeling of DS skin compared to current SOC. While improvement in scar assessment was observed in laser-treated BS HTS, no specific control for these sites was analyzed. Due to differences in pathophysiology of HTS formation at grafted and donor sites, the STSG DS may not be an adequate substitute for BS HTS when designing RCTs to evaluate the effect of FLSR. Prior studies evaluating the use FLSR in burn-related HTS consist of low-powered clinical trials or case studies without control sites or tissue level examinations, prompting the design of a RCT in DS scars. However, this scar type may not be suitable for this study design. Future work should extend to extra-cellular matrix morphology and transcriptomics of donor site and burn scar healing to better understand the effects of laser treatment.",,,,"© The Author(s) 2025.

40067859,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of remdesivir to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients: have the guidelines evolved with the evidence?,,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"With progressive accumulation of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infection clinical management, treatment guidelines recommended several options including remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum antiviral. Given the evolving nature of COVID-19, capturing the totality of scientific evidence from clinical trials and observational studies is critical to inform clinical decision making. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) with meta-analysis (MA) to summarize RDV effectiveness among hospitalized adults.
We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases for interventional and observational studies examining RDV efficacy. A rigorous double-reviewer approach was used for source identification, screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. A hierarchical random-effects model MA was used, with subgroup analyses for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and real-world (RW) studies.
From January 2019 to December 2023 over 18,000 sources were screened and 122 unique studies were identified, reporting on 25,174 participants in RCTs and 1,279,859 in RW studies. Remdesivir significantly increased survival in the overall population [OR: 0.69 (0.55-0.86); p=0.001] across SARS-CoV-2 variants and disease severity levels: no supplemental oxygen [OR: 0.81 (0.75-0.88)], low-flow oxygen [OR: 0.71 (0.64-0.79)], high-flow oxygen [OR: 0.87 (0.83-0.91)] and invasive mechanical ventilation [OR: 0.78 (0.68-0.90)]. Rehospitalization risk was significantly reduced in patients receiving remdesivir [OR: 0.72 (0.64-0.81)].
Our comprehensive SLR, capturing the totality of evidence, showed a significant survival benefit among patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection receiving RDV across all disease severity levels. To assure that healthcare providers are aware of and deploy evidence-based optimal care, recommendations should rely on both RCT and RW data.",,"From January 2019 to December 2023 over 18,000 sources were screened and 122 unique studies were identified, reporting on 25,174 participants in RCTs and 1,279,859 in RW studies.

40067771,The missing data: A review of gender and sex disparities in research.,"NIH, World Health Organization, clinical trial inclusion and representation, gender equity, gynecologic oncology, research funding",Cancer,"This article highlights the gender data gaps in clinical trial inclusion and funding, with a particular focus on gynecologic oncology. Female patients have historically been excluded from clinical trials across all medical domains. Despite recent improvements, female patients remain underrepresented in key diseases, including several cancer types, despite experiencing increased burden of disease. Lack of representation is particularly stark for patients in racial, ethnic, and gender minoritized populations, including in gynecologic cancer trials. Furthermore, female health conditions receive disproportionately small amounts of funding relative to their disease burden. Despite their high lethality, gynecologic cancers, including ovarian, cervical, and uterine malignancies, rank among the lowest funded cancer sites from the National Cancer Institute. Likewise, there is significant bias against female investigators with regard to funding, publication, and academic advancement, which affects the prioritization of women's health. In combination, gender disparities at multiple steps along the research pathway from investigator and disease funding to trial inclusion to publication and dissemination of research perpetuate a significant data gap in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases affecting female patients, including gynecologic cancers. Strategies to improve this gender gap and prioritize women's health funding include increasing female representation in clinical trials with a specific focus on inclusion of patients from historically marginalized backgrounds, considering disease burden-based funding policies, and prioritizing female academic leadership opportunities.",,,,© 2025 American Cancer Society.,10.1002/cncr.35769,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Karpel', 'firstname': 'Hannah C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zambrano Guevara', 'firstname': 'Linda M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rimel', 'firstname': 'B J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hacker', 'firstname': 'Kari E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bae-Jump', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Castellano', 'firstname': 'Tara', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, LSU-Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Curtin', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pothuri', 'firstname': 'Bhavana', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York University Langone Health, New York, New York, USA.'}"
40067681,Effectiveness of a low-glycaemic-index formula on post-gastrectomy hypoglycaemia in patients with gastric cancer: randomized crossover study.,,BJS open,"Patients undergoing gastrectomy often experience postprandial hypoglycaemia, late dumping syndrome, and night-time hypoglycaemia. However, countermeasures for post-gastrectomy hypoglycaemia rely on the patients' own efforts. We sought to investigate how post-gastrectomy hypoglycaemia could be nutritionally improved in patients with gastric cancer.
Single-centre prospective, open-labelled, randomized crossover study including patients aged 20-80 years diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma, which have undergone total or distal gastrectomy 1-5 years before the study. The patients consumed 100 ml of a low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated fatty acid formula orally 30 min after meals and before sleep (400 kcal/day) during the first or second half of a 14-day glucose-monitoring period. The effects of the low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated fatty acid formula on the time below range, that is, the percentage of time during which the glucose concentration was <70 mg/dl, and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the glucose concentration when the ideal time below range and CV were set at <5% and ≤36% respectively were assessed. Dumping symptoms were investigated before and after the study.
Thirty-eight patients were included in this study. In patients who had undergone total gastrectomy, the (median) daytime time below range, daytime CV, and night-time time below range remained high at 7.6% ((range) 0.0-45.0), 35.6% ((range) 9.5-50.5), and 10.8% ((range) 0.0-56.3) respectively, even after a long postoperative period. The (median) night-time time below range in patients who had undergone distal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy improved from 3.5% ((range) 0.0-47.9) to 1.4% ((range) 0.0-26.6) (P < 0.001, effect size 0.58) and 10.8% ((range) 0.0-56.3) to 9.4% ((range) 0.0-39.9) (P = 0.078, effect size 0.45) respectively. However, the daytime time below range and CV, as indicators of late dumping syndrome, did not change.
The low-carbohydrate/high-monounsaturated fatty acid formula improved post-gastrectomy night-time hypoglycaemia, but not daytime glycaemic variability or hypoglycaemia. Thus, further investigation of nutritional optimization is required.

40067551,"MicroRNAs in lung cancer: their role in tumor progression, biomarkers, diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance.","Biomarkers, Lung cancer, Lung cancer therapy, MicroRNAs, Tumor microenvironment",Discover oncology,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs which are associated with post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Dysfunction or aberrant expression of miRNAs is predominant in various malignancies including lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the commonest causes of cancer-related death worldwide, with a five-year survival of only 10-20%. The present review summarizes the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in the development and progression of human lung cancer and their therapeutic potential. Also, we briefly discuss the canonical biogenetic pathway of miRNAs followed by a detailed illustration on how miRNAs regulate human lung cancer progression in various ways. Furthermore, we focus on how miRNAs contribute to the crosstalk between cancer cells and different cells in the tumor microenvironment in the context of lung cancer. Finally, we illustrate how different miRNAs are used as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for lung cancer and the ongoing miRNA-associated clinical trials. In conclusion, we discuss how targeting miRNAs can be a potential therapeutic means in the treatment of human lung cancer.",,,,© 2025. The Author(s).,"10.1007/s12672-025-02054-9

40067547,Sarcoma Assessment Measure-Paediatric Version (SAM-Paeds): development of a disease-specific patient reported outcome measure for children with sarcoma.,"Patient-reported outcome, Quality of life, Sarcoma, Validation",Journal of patient-reported outcomes,"Sarcomas account for approximately 10-15% of all cancer in children aged ≤ 16. Poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is recorded in comparison to other cancers; however, these studies are limited by generic HRQoL measures not being specific to patients with sarcoma. The aim of this study was to develop paediatric version of the Sarcoma Assessment Measure (SAM).
This mixed methods study comprised three stages: item generation, item reduction and establishing content validity. Children aged 8-16 years and parents of children aged 0-16 years with a diagnosis of sarcoma and within 5 years of completion of treatment were invited to participate.
A total of 29 children and 38 parents from three sites participated in the study. Content analysis of the interview transcripts identified 277 post-diagnosis experience statements of which 128 'items' were included in an Item Reduction Questionnaire, grouped into six domains; physical, disability and inclusion; impact of diagnosis; emotional, impact on family, education. Items with a mean score < 5 and a content validity index of < 0.75 were removed. The final version of SAM-Paeds comprises 33 items (parent version) and 21 items (child version).
This study has developed the first disease-specific HRQoL measure for paediatric sarcoma patients. SAM-Paeds is planned for inclusion within international sarcoma clinical trials and will be validated alongside current generic measures. Developed with the same methodology as the adult SAM questionnaire will facilitate the assessment of QoL longitudinally to assess the long-term impact of the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoma in childhood.",,"A total of 29 children and 38 parents from three sites participated in the study.

Newly adopted nomenclature, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), allows to signify the importance of metabolic dysfunction. For which the current treatment options are limited and often associated with adverse effects, creating a need for targeted therapies. This manuscript evaluates resmetirom (RMT), a selective thyroid hormone receptor (THR)-β agonist, as a promising treatment for MASH (metabolic associated steatohepatitis). The pharmacokinetic properties, synthesis pathways, and therapeutic effects of RMT were reviewed. Preclinical and clinical trials assessed the efficacy and safety of RMT at doses of 80 mg and 100 mg, with observations that included improvements in liver histology and fibrosis scores. The manuscript also explored the role of RMT in multimodal treatment strategies alongside lifestyle modifications. RMT enhances fatty acid oxidation, modulates mitophagy, and exerts potential anti-fibrotic effects, leading to improved hepatic function and reduced disease progression. Clinical trials demonstrated significant improvements in liver histology and fibrosis scores with a favorable safety profile. RMT offers therapeutic benefits with fewer side effects compared to existing treatments for advanced MASH. RMT represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with advanced MASH, offering improved outcomes and reduced adverse effects. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness, affordability, and accessibility of RMT.",,,,"© 2025.

This article is anticipated to serve as a handy document of interest for oncologists, patients as well as academicians. The manuscript was prepared by studying the pre-clinical and clinical data available in the public domain specifically on the website of the USFDA, Clinical Trials, National Library of Medicine, and other sources. The FDA reports were comprehensively reviewed where specific information on drug approvals, safety evaluations, pharmacokinetics, and regulatory guidelines are extensively documented. Other supplementary resources, including academic journals, institutional publications, and online resources like Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science were also consulted to enrich the analysis and ensure that the findings are current and relevant. The FDA approved 55 novel drug therapies including 29 new molecular and 26 new biological entities. About 29% (16 out of 55) of these newly FAD-approved drugs have been prescribed for various cancers such as locally progressed or metastatic breast cancer, relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This manuscript covering pharmacological aspects such as therapeutic effects, approved dose, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, contraindications, and safety in special cases like pregnant, lactating, pediatric, and geriatric patients of FDA-approved anticancer drugs shall be of immense importance for researchers, academician, oncologists, and cancer patients.",,,,"© 2025.

40067410,Enhancing Radioactive Iodine (RAI) Incorporation in RAI-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Current Insights.,,European thyroid journal,"Metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is responsible for most thyroid cancer-related deaths, with an even worse prognosis for patients with radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory DTC (RAIR-DTC). While multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) offer effective treatments for RAIR-DTC, most patients remain noncurative and eventually experience disease progression. Additionally, long-term use of these medications is hindered by adverse events, drug resistance, and high cost. Recently, the use of MKIs and TKIs has reignited interest in enhancing RAI incorporation. This approach aims to restore the effectiveness of RAI therapy in patients with RAIR-DTC by using agents that increase RAI uptake, potentially overcoming current treatment challenges. This review covers the molecular mechanisms behind RAI resistance, the definition of RAIR-DTC, and the efforts to enhance RAI incorporation through various agents, including those currently undergoing clinical trials.",,,,,10.1530/ETJ-24-0319,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Hiromasa', 'firstname': 'Tomo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'T Hiromasa, nuclear medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wakabayashi', 'firstname': 'Hiroshi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'H Wakabayashi, nuclear medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Satoru', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'S Watanabe, nuclear medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamase', 'firstname': 'Takafumi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'T Yamase, nuclear medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinuya', 'firstname': 'Seigo', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'S Kinuya, nuclear medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.'}"

However, economic evaluations are needed.
This study aims to conduct a cost-utility analysis of an app for ePRO and interactive support from the perspective of the payer (Region Stockholm Health Care Organization) and to explore its impact on patient health care utilization and costs.
Two open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted, including patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (B-RCT; N=149) and radiotherapy for prostate cancer (P-RCT; N=150), recruited from oncology clinics at 2 university hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden. EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were mapped to EQ-5D-3L to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Intervention and implementation costs and health care costs, obtained from an administrative database, were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 3 ways: including all health care costs (ICERa), excluding nonacute health care costs (ICERb), and excluding health care costs altogether (ICERc). Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to explore ICER uncertainty. Health care costs were analyzed by classifying them as disease-related or acute.
In both RCT intervention groups, fewer QALYs were lost compared with the control group (P<.001). In the B-RCT, the mean intervention cost was €92 (SD €2; €1=US $1.03). The mean cost for the intervention and all health care was €36,882 (SD €1032) in the intervention group and €35,427 (SD €959) in the control group (P<.001), with an ICERa of €202,368 (95% CI €152,008-€252,728). The mean cost for the intervention and acute health care was €3585 (SD €480) in the intervention group and €3235 (SD €494) in the control group (P<.001). ICERb was €49,903 (95% CI €37,049-€62,758) and ICERc was €13,213 (95% CI €11,145-€15,281); 22 out of 74 (30%) intervention group patients and 24 out of 75 (32%) of the control group patients required acute inpatient care for fever. In the P-RCT, the mean intervention cost was €43 (SD €0.2). The mean cost for the intervention and all health care was €3419 (SD €739) in the intervention group and €3537 (SD €689) in the control group (P<.001), with an ICERa of -€1,092,136 (95% CI -€3,274,774 to €1,090,502). The mean cost for the intervention and acute health care was €1219 (SD €593) in the intervention group and €802 (SD €281) in the control group (P<.001). ICERb was €745,987 (95% CI -€247,317 to €1,739,292) and ICERc was €13,118 (95% CI -68,468 to €94,704). As many as 10 out of the 75 (13%) intervention group patients had acute inpatient care, with the most common symptom being dyspnea, while 9 out of the 75 (12%) control group patients had acute inpatient care, with the most common symptom being urinary tract infection.
ePRO and interactive support via an app generated a small improvement in QALYs at a low intervention cost and may be cost-effective, depending on the costs considered. Considerable variability in patient health care costs introduced uncertainty around the estimates, preventing a robust determination of cost-effectiveness. Larger studies examining cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective are needed. The study provides valuable insights into acute health care utilization during cancer treatment.

However, research on digital education for patients undergoing atrial fibrillation catheter ablation (AFCA) is limited.
This study aimed to develop a novel digital animation-based multistage education system and evaluate its quality-of-life benefits for patients with AFCA.
This randomized controlled clinical trial included 208 patients with AF who underwent catheter ablation in the Department of Cardiology at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between January 2022 and August 2023. The patients were randomly assigned to the digital animation intervention (n=104) and standard treatment (n=104) groups. The primary outcome was the difference in the quality of life of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF-QoL-18) scores at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included differences in scores on the 5-item Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) at 3 months.
In the digital animation intervention group, the AF-QoL-18 score increased from 38.02 (SD 6.52) to 47.77 (SD 5.74), the MARS-5 score increased from 17.04 (SD 3.03) to 20.13 (SD 2.12), the SAS score decreased from 52.82 (SD 8.08) to 45.39 (SD 6.13), and the SDS score decreased from 54.12 (SD 6.13) to 45.47 (SD 5.94), 3 months post discharge from the hospital. In the conventional treatment group, the AF-QoL-18 score increased from 36.97 (SD 7.00) to 45.31 (SD 5.71), the MARS-5 score increased from 17.14 (SD 3.01) to 18.47 (SD 2.79), the SAS score decreased from 51.83 (SD 7.74) to 47.31 (SD 5.87), and the SDS score decreased from 52.78 (SD 5.21) to 45.37 (SD 6.18). The mean difference in AF-QoL-18 score change between the 2 groups was 1.41 (95% CI 2.42-0.40, P=.006) at 3 months. The mean difference in MARS-5 score change was 1.76 (95% CI 2.42-1.10, P<.001). The mean difference in SAS score was -2.91 (95% CI -3.88 to -1.95, P<.001). Additionally, the mean difference in SDS score was -1.23 (95% CI -0.02 to -2.44, P=.047).
Our study introduces a novel digital animation educational approach that provides multidimensional, easily understandable, and multistage education for patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation. This educational model effectively improves postoperative anxiety, depression, medication adherence, and quality of life in patients at 3 months post discharge.

40067303,Enfortumab Vedotin With or Without Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,,JAMA network open,"Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) presents a therapeutic challenge with poor outcome. Enfortumab vedotin has emerged as a promising treatment, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness and safety.
To synthesize the available evidence on enfortumab vedotin, both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, as an mUC treatment for the purpose of guiding clinical decision-making and future research.
Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched from database inception to August 31, 2024. Major conference abstracts from 2019 to 2024 were also included. Search strategy used a combination of Medical Subject Heading terms and free-text keywords related to mUC and enfortumab vedotin.
Randomized clinical trials and prospective studies investigating enfortumab vedotin in adult patients with mUC were included. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria.
Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool. The meta-analysis used a random effects model, while a network meta-analysis was performed using a frequentist approach.
Primary outcomes were disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), and 1-year survival rate.
The 11 included studies (3 randomized clinical trials [27.3%] and 8 nonrandomized prospective studies [72.7%]) involved 2128 patients. Of these patients, 563 (26.5%) received enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab, 814 (38.3%) received enfortumab vedotin without pembrolizumab, and 751 (35.3%) received chemotherapy. Enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab was associated with a pooled DCR of 86% (95% CI, 83%-89%), ORR of 68% (95% CI, 64%-71%), and a 1-year survival rate of 79% (95% CI, 75%-82%). Enfortumab vedotin monotherapy had a pooled DCR of 73% (95% CI, 70%-76%), ORR of 43% (95% CI, 40%-47%), and a 1-year survival rate of 52% (95% CI, 48%-56%). Network meta-analysis revealed that enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab significantly outperformed chemotherapy in ORR (odds ratio [OR], 3.47; 95% CI, 1.49-8.09; P = .004) and 1-year survival (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.75-3.06; P < .001).
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab showed high response rates in first-line settings, while enfortumab vedotin monotherapy was associated with clinical benefit in later lines of therapy. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches, and future research is warranted to refine enfortumab vedotin-based therapies for mUC management.",,"The 11 included studies (3 randomized clinical trials [27.3%] and 8 nonrandomized prospective studies [72.7%]) involved 2128 patients.

40067302,Clinical Outcomes of Hypertonic Saline vs Mannitol Treatment Among Children With Traumatic Brain Injury.,,JAMA network open,"The use of hypertonic saline (HTS) vs mannitol in the control of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to neurotrauma is debated.
To compare mortality and functional outcomes of treatment with 3% HTS vs 20% mannitol among children with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at risk of elevated ICP.
This prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted between June 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022, at 28 participating pediatric intensive care units in the Pediatric Acute and Critical Care Medicine in Asia Network (PACCMAN) and the Red Colaborativa Pediátrica de Latinoamérica (LARed) in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. The study included children (aged <18 years) with moderate to severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score ≤13).
Treatment with 3% HTS compared with 20% mannitol.
Multiple log-binomial regression analysis was performed for mortality, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed for discharge Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scores and 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Pediatric Version (GOS-E-Peds) scores. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was also performed using the propensity score method to control for baseline imbalance between groups.
This study included 445 children with a median age of 5.0 (IQR, 2.0-11.0) years. More than half of the patients (279 [62.7%]) were boys, and 344 (77.3%) had severe TBI. Overall, 184 children (41.3%) received 3% HTS, 82 (18.4%) received 20% mannitol, 69 (15.5%) received both agents, and 110 (24.7%) received neither agent. The mortality rate was 7.1% (13 of 184 patients) in the HTS group and 11.0% (9 of 82 patients) in the mannitol group (P = .34). After adjusting for age, sex, presence of child abuse, time between injury and hospital arrival, lowest GCS score in the first 24 hours, and presence of extradural hemorrhage, no between-group differences in mortality, hospital discharge PCPC scores, or 3-month GOS-E-Peds scores were observed.

40067297,Emergency Department Programs to Support Medication Safety in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,,JAMA network open,"Given that older adults are at high risk for adverse drug events (ADEs), many geriatric medication programs have aimed to optimize safe ordering, prescribing, and deprescribing practices.
To identify emergency department (ED)-based geriatric medication programs that are associated with reductions in potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and ADEs.
A systematic search of Scopus, Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, ProQuest Central, CINAHL, AgeLine, and Cochrane Library was conducted on February 14, 2024, with no date limits applied.
Randomized clinical trials or observational studies focused on ED-based geriatric (aged ≥65 years) medication programs that provide ED clinician support to avoid PIMs and reduce ADEs.
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for abstracting data and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool were used to assess data quality and validity. Abstract screening and full-text review were independently conducted by 2 reviewers, with a third reviewer acting as an adjudicator.
Process (ordering, prescribing, and deprescribing PIM rates) and clinical (ADE, health care utilization, and falls) outcomes.
The search strategy identified 3665 unique studies, 98 were assessed for eligibility in full-text review, and 25 studies, with 44 640 participants, were included: 9 clinical pharmacist reviews (with 28 360 participants), 1 geriatrician teleconsultation (with 50 participants), 8 clinician educational interventions (with 5888 participants), 4 computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSS; with 9462 participants), and 3 fall risk-increasing drug (FRID) reviews (with 880 participants). Clinical pharmacist review was not associated with decreased hospital admission or length of stay, but 2 studies showed a 32% reduction in PIMs from deprescribing (odds ratio [OR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; P = .01). One study also found that ED geriatrician teleconsultation was associated with enhanced deprescribing of PIMs. Three clinician educational intervention studies showed a 19% reduction in PIM prescribing (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.96]; P = .02). Two computerized CDSS studies showed a 40% reduction in PIM ordering (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.48-0.74]; P < .001).

Food insecurity; dietary, physiologic, quality of life, health outcomes; sensitivity and specificity of screening tools.
One RCT (n = 789) examined the impact of screening for food insecurity and found no difference in food insecurity after 6 months (29.6% in the intervention group vs 29.8% with usual care). Ten accuracy studies (n = 123 886) compared 1-, 2-, and 6-item subsets of the US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey (HFSS) with the full HFSS. Sensitivity was typically above 95% and specificity above 82%, although most studies did not administer the screener separately from the reference standard, potentially overstating the accuracy. Twenty-nine studies (n = 74 292) examined interventions to address food insecurity, but 27 were rated as poor quality for the outcomes of interest for this review. Of the 2 fair-quality studies, 1 randomized crossover study (n = 44) found that home delivery of medically tailored meals was associated with reduced food insecurity (41.9% while ""on meals"" vs 61.5% while ""off meals,"" P = .05). The other fair-quality propensity-matched cohort study found a smaller increase in body mass index among children whose families participated in a mobile food bank than those who did not after 6 months (mean difference in change, -0.68 [95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2]). The remaining studies found wide-ranging effect sizes for change in food security status but generally trended in the direction of benefit.
Brief screening tools likely have sufficient sensitivity to identify people with food insecurity in health care settings, but most studies of interventions to improve food insecurity had high risk of bias, limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions.",,"One RCT (n = 789) examined the impact of screening for food insecurity and found no difference in food insecurity after 6 months (29.6% in the intervention group vs 29.8% with usual care). Ten accuracy studies (n = 123 886) compared 1-, 2-, and 6-item subsets of the US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey (HFSS) with the full HFSS. Sensitivity was typically above 95% and specificity above 82%, although most studies did not administer the screener separately from the reference standard, potentially overstating the accuracy. Twenty-nine studies (n = 74 292) examined interventions to address food insecurity, but 27 were rated as poor quality for the outcomes of interest for this review. Of the 2 fair-quality studies, 1 randomized crossover study (n = 44) found that home delivery of medically tailored meals was associated with reduced food insecurity (41.9% while ""on meals"" vs 61.5% while ""off meals,"" P = .05). The other fair-quality propensity-matched cohort study found a smaller increase in body mass index among children whose families participated in a mobile food bank than those who did not after 6 months (mean difference in change, -0.68 [95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2]).

40067105,MRI-based Deep Learning Algorithm for Assisting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection: A Bicenter Prospective Study.,,Radiology,"Background Although artificial intelligence is actively being developed for prostate MRI, few studies have prospectively validated these tools. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of a commercial deep learning algorithm (DLA) and radiologists' clinical reports for cancer detection in participants from two hospitals using histopathologic findings from biopsy specimens as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This prospective bicenter study enrolled participants suspected of having prostate cancer (PCa) who were scheduled for biopsy based on clinical information, including prostate MRI, from December 2022 to July 2023. Targeted prostate biopsies were performed for lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores of 3 or higher, identified by either radiologists or the DLA. PI-RADS classifications by radiologists (using all imaging sequences), the DLA (using biparametric MRI), and the scenario in which radiologist-based PI-RADS 3 scores were modulated with DLA-based PI-RADS scores were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with DeLong and McNemar tests. Results A total of 259 lesions, including 117 clinically significant PCas (csPCas) (Gleason grade group ≥2), were evaluated in 205 men (median age, 68 years; age range, 47-90 years). At per-lesion analysis, the DLA had a lower sensitivity (94 of 117; 80%) and higher positive predictive value (PPV) (94 of 163; 58%) for detecting csPCa than did the radiologists (109 of 117 [93%] and 109 of 227 [48%]; ",,,,,10.1148/radiol.232788,2025-03-12,"{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Young Joon', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Radiology, Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 1021 Tongil-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul 03312, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Moon', 'firstname': 'Hyong Woo', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Moon Hyung', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Radiology, Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 1021 Tongil-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul 03312, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Eun Jung', 'firstname': 'Seung', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Radiology, Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 1021 Tongil-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul 03312, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Yong Hyun', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Ji Youl', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Dong Hwan', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Radiology, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Eun Rha', 'firstname': 'Sung', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Radiology, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Sang Hoon', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Kyu Won', 'initials': 'KW', 'affiliation': ""Department of Urology, Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Yeong-Jin', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Hospital Pathology, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Young Sub', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': ""Department of Hospital Pathology, Eunpyeong St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Woojoo', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\nInstitute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Seungjae', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Grimm', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Imaging, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'von Busch', 'firstname': 'Heinrich', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Imaging, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Dongyeob', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Imaging, Siemens Healthineers, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lou', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Digital Technology and Innovation, Siemens Healthineers, Princeton, NJ.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamen', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Digital Technology and Innovation, Siemens Healthineers, Princeton, NJ.'}"
40067039,Influence of Remifentanil on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Remimazolam in Healthy Volunteers.,,Anesthesiology,"Synergistic effects between opioids and remimazolam on Bispectral Index (BIS) and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAAS) score were previously described. This study aimed to characterize the influence of remifentanil on the sedative properties of remimazolam as measured by MOAAS, BIS, and tolerance to laryngoscopy or tetanic stimulation (TOL or TOTS) and to determine target concentrations that maximize MOAAS 2 or 3.
A three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial was performed in 24 healthy volunteers. In all periods, remimazolam was administered using a step-up and step-down target controlled infusion protocol (50 to 2,000 ng/ml). Stable remifentanil target concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml and 0.1 to 4.0 ng/ml were maintained in periods 2 and 3, respectively. Remifentanil, remimazolam, and CNS7054 (metabolite) concentrations and MOAAS, BIS, TOL, and TOTS were collected in each step of the target controlled infusion protocol. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects models, where P ≤ 0.01 was considered significant.
Remifentanil reduced the apparent clearance of CNS7054 with a half-maximum inhibition at 8.0 ng/ml (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.4 ng/ml). A pharmacodynamic interaction was detected on all endpoints. Simulations indicate that the probability of observing a MOAAS 2 or 3 is highest at remimazolam target concentration of 275, 250, or 200 ng/ml combined with 0, 0.1, or 0.5 ng/ml remifentanil resulting in probabilities of 45%, 45%, and 44%, respectively. Additionally, simulations indicate that the highest probability of observing TOTS and TOL was 93.3% and 85.5%, respectively, at the highest studied target concentrations.
A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between remimazolam and remifentanil was quantified in this clinical trial. Appropriate target concentrations for MOAAS and BIS could be estimated, but for TOL and TOTS, the trial design did not allow to fully characterize the exposure-response relationship.",,"Remifentanil reduced the apparent clearance of CNS7054 with a half-maximum inhibition at 8.0 ng/ml (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.4 ng/ml).

40067038,Emulating Target Trials to Study Perioperative and Critical Care Interventions with Observational Data: Promise and Limitations.,,Anesthesiology,"Estimating effects of interventions is a central task in perioperative and critical care outcomes research. While randomized trials remain the accepted standard for causal inference, trial data are not always available to inform clinical decisions, and some questions cannot be answered feasibly or efficiently with trials. In these settings, studies using observational healthcare data may be used to inform practice. Causal inference from observational data has been reconsidered in recent years, challenging the prevailing notion among clinical researchers that causal conclusions cannot be drawn from observational studies. The ""target trial framework"" is one contribution within a growing methodologic field that helps investigators avoid common pitfalls in observational study design and analysis. Importantly, researchers must understand which biases this framework can-and cannot-help avoid. The authors present an overview of target trial emulation and describe the promise and limitations of this framework for improving observational perioperative and critical care outcomes research.",,,,Copyright © 2025 American Society of Anesthesiologists.

40066950,Pelvic floor muscle training with feedback or biofeedback for urinary incontinence in women.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), compared to no treatment, is effective for treating urinary incontinence (UI) in women. Feedback and biofeedback are additional resources that give women more information about their pelvic floor muscle contraction. The extra information could improve training performance by increasing capability or motivation for PFMT. The Committee on Conservative Management from the 7th International Consultation on Incontinence states that the benefit of adding biofeedback to PFMT is unclear. This review is an update of a Cochrane review last published in 2011.
The primary objective was to assess the effects of PFMT with feedback or biofeedback, or both, for UI in women. We considered the following research questions. Are there differences in the effects of PFMT with feedback, biofeedback, or both versus PFMT without these adjuncts in the management of stress, urgency or mixed UI in women? Are there differences in the effects of feedback versus biofeedback as adjuncts to PFMT for women with UI? Are there differences in the effects of different types of biofeedback?
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register (searched 27 September 2023), which includes searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and the reference lists of relevant articles.
We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs in women with UI. We excluded studies that recruited women with neurological conditions, who were pregnant or less than six months postpartum. Eligible studies made one of the following comparisons: PFMT plus feedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus biofeedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus feedback or biofeedback versus PFMT alone, PFMT plus feedback versus PFMT plus biofeedback, and one type of biofeedback versus another.
Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, extracted data onto a prepiloted form, and assessed risk of bias using RoB 1. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence in each comparison by outcome. Our primary outcome was lower urinary tract symptom-specific quality of life. We pooled data using a standardised mean difference (SMD). Secondary outcomes were leakage episodes in 24 hours (mean difference (MD)), leakage severity (MD), subjective cure or improvement (odds ratio (OR)), satisfaction (OR), and adverse events (descriptive summary).
We included 41 completed studies with 3483 women. Most (33 studies, 3031 women) investigated the effect of PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT alone. Eleven studies were at low risk of bias overall, 27 at unclear risk of bias, and three at high risk. Only one study reported leakage severity, with no usable data. Comparison 1. PFMT with feedback versus PFMT alone: one eligible study reported no outcome of interest. Comparison 2. PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT alone: there was little or no difference in incontinence quality of life (SMD 0.07 lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 lower to 0.05 higher; 11 studies, 1169 women; high-certainty evidence). Women randomised to biofeedback had 0.29 fewer leakage episodes in 24 hours versus PFMT alone (MD 0.29 lower, 95% CI 0.42 lower to 0.16 lower; 12 studies, 932 women; moderate-certainty evidence), but this slight reduction in leakage episodes may not be clinically important. Women in biofeedback arms report that there is probably little to no difference in cure or improvement (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.58; 14 studies, 1383 women; moderate-certainty evidence) but may report greater satisfaction with treatment outcomes (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.7; 6 studies, 390 women; low-certainty evidence). None of these outcomes were blinded. Eight studies (711 women) assessed severe adverse events but reported that there were no events. Comparison 3. PFMT with feedback or biofeedback versus PFMT alone: a single study contributed very-low certainty evidence regarding leakage episodes in 24 hours, subjective cure or improvement, and satisfaction. Comparison 4. PFMT with feedback versus PFMT with biofeedback: the evidence is very uncertain about any difference in effect between biofeedback versus feedback for incontinence-related quality of life. Not only is the evidence certainty very low, the confidence interval is very wide and there could be a more than small effect in favour of biofeedack or feedback (SMD 0.14 lower, 95% CI 0.56 lower to 0.28 higher; 2 studies, 91 women; very-low certainty evidence). There may be fewer leakage episodes in 24 hours for women receiving biofeedback verus feedback but the difference may not be clinically important and the evidence certainty is low (MD 0.28 lower, 95% CI 0.62 lower to 0.07 higher; 2 studies, 120 women; low-certainty evidence). There were no data for subjective cure, improvement or satisfaction. One study measured adverse events and none were reported. Comparison 5. PFMT with biofeedback versus PFMT with another type of biofeedback: five studies assessed this comparison, with individual studies contributing data for separate outcomes. There was low- or very-low certainty evidence about the benefits of one type of biofeedback versus another for leakage episodes in 24 hours or subjective cure or improvement, respectively. One study reported adverse events from two of nine women receiving electromyography biofeedback versus six of 10 receiving pressure biofeedback.
PFMT with biofeedback results in little to no difference in incontinence quality of life. The addition of biofeedback to PFMT likely results in a small unimportant difference in leakage episodes in 24 hours, and likely little to no difference in patient-reported cure or improvement. Satisfaction may increase slightly for PFMT with biofeedback, based on low-certainty evidence. Five of the 33 studies in this comparison collected information about adverse events, and four reported none in either group. Adverse events reported by women using biofeedback seemed related to using a vaginal or rectal device (e.g. discomfort with device in place, vaginal discharge). The other comparisons had few, small studies, and low- to very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes. None of the studies reported any severe adverse events.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 The Cochrane Collaboration.

40066941,Sulfonylurea drugs for people with severe hemispheric ischemic stroke.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Large hemispheric infarction (LHI), caused by occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery, is the most malignant type of supratentorial ischemic stroke. Due to severe intracranial edema, mortality fluctuates between 53% and 78%, even after the most effective medical treatment. Decompressive craniectomy can reduce mortality by approximately 17% to 36%, but the neurological outcomes are not satisfactory, and there are contraindications to surgery. Therapeutic hypothermia shows promising effects in preclinical research, but it causes many complications, and clinical studies have not confirmed its efficacy. Glibenclamide is a type of sulfonylurea. Preclinical research shows that glibenclamide can reduce mortality and brain edema and improve neurological outcomes in animal models of ischemic stroke. Sulfonylureas may be a promising treatment for individuals with LHI.
To evaluate the effects of sulfonylurea drugs in people with large hemispheric ischemic stroke.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and three trials registers. We also searched gray literature sources, checked the bibliographies of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and used Cited Reference Search in Google Scholar. The latest search date was 23 March 2024.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sulfonylureas with placebo, hypothermia, or usual care in people with severe hemispheric ischemic stroke.
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were neurological and functional outcomes. Our secondary outcomes were death, quality of life, adverse events, and complications. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.
This review includes two RCTs (N = 621): the GAMES-RP trial (glyburide advantage in malignant edema and stroke) and the CHARM trial (phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous BIIB093 (glibenclamide) for severe cerebral edema following large hemispheric infarction). Both studies compared the effects of intravenous glyburide (0.13 mg bolus intravenous injection for the first 2 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.16 mg/h for the first 6 hours and then 0.11 mg/h for the remaining 66 hours) to placebo. The GAMES-RP trial (N = 86) was conducted in 18 hospitals in the USA (mean age: intervention = 58 ± 11 years; control = 63 ± 9 years); the CHARM trial (N = 535) was conducted in 20 countries across North and South America and Eurasia (mean age: intervention = 60.5 ± 11.17 years; control = 61.6 ± 10.81 years). The overall risk of bias was high in both trials. Neither trial reported neurological outcomes. Compared with placebo, glyburide may result in little to no difference in functional outcomes, assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (range 0 to 4) at 90 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.32; P = 0.43; 2 studies, 508 participants; low-certainty evidence), or death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.69; P = 0.53; 2 studies, 595 participants; low-certainty evidence). Glyburide likely results in a large increased risk of hypoglycemia (RR 4.66, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.67; P = 0.005; 2 studies, 601 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to placebo. However, it probably results in little to no difference between groups in cardiac events (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.14; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 601 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or pneumonia (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.44; 1 study, 518 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may result in little to no difference between groups in neurological deterioration within three days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.27; 1 study, 77 participants; low-certainty evidence).
Compared to placebo, intravenous glyburide may have little to no effect on functional outcomes, assessed with the modified Rankin Scale, or mortality. It may also have little to no effect on neurological deterioration within three days, and probably has little to no effect on cardiac events or pneumonia. However, intravenous glyburide probably results in a large increased risk of hypoglycemia. This review includes only two RCTs at overall high risk of bias. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine the effects of sulfonylureas in people with ischemic stroke. More large studies, which include more sulfonylurea drugs with different routes of administration and dosages, and different age groups with ischemic stroke, would help to reduce the current uncertainties.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 The Cochrane Collaboration.

40066936,Safety and efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in preterm infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Although physiological reflux is seen in nearly all newborns to varying degrees, symptoms can be severe and cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In preterm infants, one symptom that is often attributed to GERD is apnea and associated cardiorespiratory events, such as bradycardia and oxygen desaturation. Although the relationship between GERD and apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation events remains a subject of ongoing investigation, trials of agents that reduce gastric acidity, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI), have been conducted to assess the effect of these agents on GERD.
To assess the benefits and harms of PPIs for the treatment of preterm infants with diagnosed or suspected GERD.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registries, and Epistemonikos in October 2023. We checked reference lists of included studies, and studies and systematic reviews in which the subject matter was related to the intervention or population examined in this review.
We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, cross-over trials, and cluster-randomized trials that assessed the use of PPIs (including esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, or rabeprazole) alone or in combination. Infants had to receive treatment for a minimum of three days. We considered the following comparisons: (1) PPIs versus no treatment, (2) PPI versus positioning changes (elevated head of bed or prone positioning), (3) PPI versus dietary changes (thickened feeds). We excluded studies examining alginates and histamine receptor blockers. Studies including other non-pharmacological interventions for GERD were included if these interventions were available to infants in all study groups.
Two review authors independently identified eligible trials, reviewed the methodological quality of each trial, and extracted data on prespecified outcomes. Data were compared and differences resolved. We used standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to synthesize data using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), and mean difference (MD).
After screening 1217 articles, only two studies, enrolling a total of 62 infants, met our criteria. Both studies compared the use of PPIs to no treatment (placebo). One study included ten infants with a mean gestational age of 36.1 ± 0.7 weeks, who were treated with seven days of PPI or placebo, and then crossed over to the other study arm for seven days, with gastric pH monitoring performed at the end of each week. The other study included 52 infants with a mean gestational age of 31 weeks, who were randomized to a PPI or placebo for 14 days, with various outcomes measured at baseline and after 14 days. Both studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Only one study (N = 52) reported the primary outcome, cardiorespiratory events. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of PPIs on cardiorespiratory events (MD 6.14 lower, 95% CI 44.51 lower to 32.23 higher). The evidence is very uncertain for the reported secondary outcome measures, including apnea at the end of treatment (MD 0.30 lower, 95% CI 0.93 lower to 0.33 higher), bradycardia at the end of treatment (MD 1.89 higher, 95% CI 1.11 lower to 4.89 higher), desaturation at the end of treatment (MD 7.72 lower, 95% CI 45.86 lower to 30.42 higher), choking at the end of the treatment (MD 0.96 higher, 95% CI 1.88 lower to 3.80 higher), irritability at the end of treatment (MD 0.02 higher, 95% CI 11 lower to 10.96 higher), and vomiting at the end of treatment (MD 0.34 higher, 95% CI 3.15 lower to 3.83 higher). The study was prematurely discontinued due to poor enrollment. One study (N = 10) reported a marked reduction in the percentage of time spent with esophageal acid exposure, with pH < 4. However, there was no effect on the frequency of symptoms. The study sample precludes the ability to extrapolate any significant data. Neither study reported data on length of stay or parental satisfaction. There were insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis. No trials addressed the issue of PPI versus positioning changes, or PPI versus dietary changes (thickened feeds).
Although widely used, there are insufficient data regarding the benefits and harms of proton pump inhibitors in preterm infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease. The most limiting factor was the paucity of studies on preterm infants. Even the studies that were included in this review were not limited to preterm infants. Hence, further studies are needed to address the safety and efficacy of proton pump inhibitors for the treatment of diagnosed or suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease in preterm neonates.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 The Cochrane Collaboration.

40066932,Rituximab for people with multiple sclerosis.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological cause of disability in young adults. Off-label rituximab for MS is used in most countries surveyed by the International Federation of MS, including high-income countries where on-label disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) are available. This updates the 2021 version of the review.
To assess the benefits and harms of rituximab as 'first choice' and 'switching' treatment for adults with any form of MS.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and three trials registers on 31 December 2023, together with reference checking and contacting study authors to identify unpublished studies.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing rituximab with placebo or another DMT for adults with any form of MS.
We followed standard Cochrane methods. We used RoB 1 to assess risk of bias in RCTs and ROBINS-I in NRSIs. We assessed the certainty of evidence for critical and important prioritised outcomes using GRADE: disability worsening, relapse, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), common infections, cancer, and mortality. We conducted separate analyses for rituximab as 'first choice' or as 'switching' treatment, relapsing or progressive MS, comparison with placebo or another DMT, and RCTs or NRSIs.
In this update, the number of study participants increased from 16,429 (15 studies) to 37,443 (28 studies; 13 new studies: 1 RCT and 12 NRSIs). The studies were conducted worldwide; most originated from high-income countries (25 studies). Public institutions funded 22 (79%) of the studies. Most studies investigated the effects of rituximab on people with relapsing MS (19 studies; 27,500 (73%) participants). We identified 12 ongoing studies. Rituximab as 'first choice' for active relapsing MS None of the included studies compared rituximab to placebo. One RCT compared rituximab to dimethyl fumarate, with 24 months' follow-up. Rituximab may reduce the recurrence of relapse (odds ratio (OR) 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.57; 195 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on disability worsening and SAEs. Rituximab may result in little to no difference in upper respiratory tract infections (rate ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for urinary tract, skin, and viral infections. HRQoL, cancer, and mortality were not reported. One NRSI compared rituximab to other DMTs, with 24 months' follow-up. Disability worsening was not reported. Compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, rituximab likely delays relapse (hazard ratio (HR) 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.39; 1 study, 335 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with dimethyl fumarate and natalizumab, rituximab may delay relapse (dimethyl fumarate: HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00; 1 study, 206 participants; low-certainty evidence; natalizumab: HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.00; 1 study, 170 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence for relapse is very uncertain when comparing rituximab to fingolimod. The effect on SAEs is uncertain due to very few events in all the comparison groups. No deaths were reported. HRQoL, common infections, and cancer were not reported. Rituximab as 'first choice' for primary progressive MS One RCT compared rituximab to placebo, with 24 months' follow-up. Rituximab likely results in little or no difference in disability worsening (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.11; 439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on relapse, SAEs, common infections, cancer, and mortality. HRQoL was not reported. None of the included studies compared rituximab as 'first choice' treatment to other DMTs for primary or secondary progressive MS. Rituximab as 'switching' treatment for relapsing MS One small RCT compared rituximab to placebo, with 12 months' follow-up. Disability worsening was not reported. Rituximab may reduce recurrence of relapses (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.93; 1 study, 104 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain regarding SAEs, common infections, cancer, and mortality. HRQoL was not reported. Twelve NRSIs compared rituximab to other DMTs, with 24 months' follow-up. The evidence on disability worsening is very uncertain in comparison with interferons or glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and ocrelizumab. Rituximab likely delays time to relapse in comparison with interferons or glatiramer acetate (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 1 study, 1383 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fingolimod (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.32; 1 study, 256 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may result in little or no difference compared with natalizumab (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.10; 3 studies, 1922 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on relapse in comparison with alemtuzumab. There is uncertainty regarding SAEs when comparing rituximab to natalizumab and fingolimod. Rituximab likely increases serious common infections when compared with interferon beta or glatiramer acetate (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.62; 1 study, 5477 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and natalizumab (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.32; 2 studies, 5001 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence for common infections is very uncertain when comparing rituximab to fingolimod and ocrelizumab. Rituximab may slightly reduce the risk of cancer compared with natalizumab (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99; 2 studies, 6202 participants; low-certainty evidence), whereas the evidence is very uncertain in comparison with fingolimod. The effect of rituximab on mortality is very uncertain due to very few events in all the comparison groups. HRQoL was not reported.
For preventing relapses in relapsing MS, rituximab as 'first choice' and 'switching' treatment compares favourably with a wide range of approved DMTs. The protective effect of rituximab against disability worsening is uncertain. There is limited information to determine the effect of rituximab on primary progressive MS. There is limited evidence for long-term adverse events of rituximab in people with MS. Evidence for serious adverse events, cancer, and mortality was of very low certainty due to few events. There is an increased risk of serious (hospital-treated) infections with rituximab compared with other DMTs, although the absolute risk is low. High-quality (prospectively registered) NRSIs should be conducted to draw more reliable conclusions about the potential benefits and harms of rituximab in people with MS.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 The Cochrane Collaboration.

40066600,Efficacy and safety of non-ablative vs. ablative lasers for acne scarring: A meta-analysis.,"Acne Scarring, ablative lasers, meta‐analysis, non‐ablative lasers, safety profile, treatment efficacy",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,"Acne scarring significantly affects physical appearance and psychological well-being, prompting the exploration of various treatment options, including ablative and non-ablative laser therapies. The debate around their efficacy and safety persists, underscoring the need for a comprehensive analysis. This meta-analysis compares the therapeutic outcomes and safety profiles of ablative and non-ablative laser treatments for acne scars, based on a comprehensive review of clinical trials conducted up to March 2023. The evaluation focused on clinical improvement, patient satisfaction, and the incidence of treatment-related complications. Analysis of seven studies encompassing 186 cases revealed that non-ablative lasers are more effective for atrophic acne scars, offering a better safety profile with fewer adverse effects, such as reduced pain and shorter erythema durations. Conversely, ablative laser therapy demonstrated superior results in both observer-based and patient-driven evaluations. The findings suggest that while both laser types are effective in mitigating acne scarring, the choice between ablative and non-ablative lasers should consider the balance between efficacy and safety. The study highlights the necessity for more standardized research to refine laser treatment protocols for acne scars, aiming to optimize outcomes and minimize risks.",,,,© 2025 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG).,10.1111/ddg.15651,2025-03-11,"{'lastname': 'Ke', 'firstname': 'Ruonan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Beichen', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ni', 'firstname': 'Xuejun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Qian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Lu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Yunjia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wan', 'firstname': 'Xiaofen', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shan', 'firstname': 'Xiuying', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Biao', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Plastic Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.\nDepartment of Plastic Surgery, National Regional Medical Center, Binhai Campus of the First Affiliated Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.'}"

The objective of this analysis was to examine the dose-ranging trials utilized in pediatric drug development and to determine (1) the dose-ranging strategies that were used in all available pediatric dose-ranging studies, (2) the success of achieving pediatric labeling in those submissions to the US Food and Drug Administration, and (3) ethical aspects of providing a prospect of direct benefit to pediatric patients in dose-ranging studies. Of the 275 programs that previously surveyed pediatric drug development programs from 2012 to 2020, it was determined that dose-ranging studies were used for 97 (35.3%) programs. The three categorizations of these 97 programs included the parallel dose design (n = 66; 68%), the dose-escalation design (n = 18; 18.6%), and the crossover design (n = 13; 13.4%). In the 66 that used a parallel design, 41 of these products were approved for use in pediatric patients. In 13 out of the 41 drugs (31.7%) approved for pediatric use using parallel dose ranging, the lowest parallel dose (patient on the dose for the entire study) was lower than the approved dose. Dose ranging remains an important strategy for optimizing dosing, but ethical considerations and the need to optimize benefit for individual patients should drive decisions about dosing approaches in pediatric patients.

40066441,Endometrial immune profiling and precision therapy increase live birth rate after embryo transfer: a randomised controlled trial.,"IVF, endometrial immune profiling, precision care, pregnancy, randomised controlled trial, uterine immune regulation",Frontiers in immunology,"Despite advancements in assisted reproductive treatments, 70% of transferred embryos fail to implant successfully, yielding significant personal and global repercussions. One promising avenue of research is to take into account the individual's immune uterine profile in order to tailor treatment and optimise outcomes. This randomised controlled trial represents the initial exploration into the consequences of disregarding the state of the uterine immune environment in infertile women embarking on IVF/ICSI.
This randomised controlled open two-arm trial included IVF patients, with assessment of immune endometrial environment and precision therapy before embryo transfer (ET). 493 patients were enrolled from October 2015 to February2023. Endometrial biopsies were collected during the mid-luteal phase. Endometrial immune profiling involves the analysis of cytokine biomarkers in the endometrium. If an immune endometrial dysregulation was diagnosed, a computerised randomisation assigned patients to either a conventional ET (disregarding the immune profile) or a personalised ET (with a precision therapy adapted to the immune profile). The primary analysis focussed on demonstrating the superiority of precision treatments using the modified intent-to-treat population (mITT), excluding patients without ET. The primary endpoint was the live birth rate (LBR) following the first attempt of ET.
Among the population, 78% had an endometrial immune dysregulation and were randomised. The mITT analysis showed a significant increase in LBR with precision care compared to conventional care (29.7% vs. 41.4%; OR: 1.68 [1.04-2.73], p=0.036). The positive impact of precision care was particularly noticeable in patients with morphologically suboptimal embryos (LBR: 21.2% vs. 39.6%; OR: 2.12 [1.02-4.41]) or those with a history of two or more failed ET (LBR: 23.4% vs. 48.1%; OR: 3.03 [1.17-7.85]).
The data should be interpreted with caution due to inherent structural limitations of human IVF trials. Generalising and empowering our findings would rely on the replication of controlled trials by independent research teams possibly integrating the usage of optimised embryo quality with PGT-A.
The regulation of the endometrial immune environment emerges as one of the leading innovative strategies to facilitate embryo implantation and enhance the overall performance of assisted reproductive therapies (ART). Based on these findings, endometrial immune profiling could become an essential part of routine ART practice.

40066438,Update on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: a narrative review.,"IL-6 receptor inhibitor, efficacy and safety, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence (RWE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tocilizumab (TCZ)",Frontiers in immunology,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor, has emerged as an effective treatment for RA. This narrative review provides an update on TCZ's efficacy and safety based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world evidence (RWE). TCZ, available in subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulations, has shown significant benefits in RA management. Key clinical trials, including SAMURAI, OPTION, RADIATE, and TOWARD, have demonstrated TCZ's efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), particularly in patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Long-term studies, such as STREAM, have highlighted TCZ's sustained efficacy and favorable safety profile over 5 years. The impact of TCZ on cardiovascular health, lipid profiles, and the risk of infections has been a focal point, with findings suggesting no significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk compared to other RA therapies. RWE further highlights the effectiveness of TCZ, identifying predictors of response, such as age, and emphasizes its suitability for biologic-naïve and overweight patients. Special considerations include TCZ use in RA-associated interstitial lung disease and amyloidosis. Overall, TCZ remains a pivotal option in RA treatment, with a well-established safety and efficacy profile supported by extensive clinical and real-world data.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 Parisi, Ditto, Ghellere, Panaro, Piccione, Borrelli and Fusaro.","10.3389/fimmu.2025.1470488

40066342,Pulmonary arterial hypertension in Latin America. The age and comorbidity paradox.,,International journal of cardiology. Congenital heart disease,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been classically described as a disease in young adults, predominantly females with no comorbidities. However, in recent registries, the epidemiology has changed to older patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, systemic hypertension, and coronary heart disease. Nevertheless, there is not enough inclusion of these patients in clinical trials. In contrast, in Latin America, registries have shown that PAH patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities, which raises the question of whether Latin American patients present a different phenotype or if we are lagging behind developed countries and whether we will experience a change in epidemiology in the next couple of years. We analyzed these trends in this review.",,,,© 2025 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.ijcchd.2025.100573

Congenital heart disease,"Advances in medical care have significantly extended the lifespan of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), allowing most to survive into adulthood. However, they continue to face significant cardiovascular morbidity, particularly atrial arrhythmias (AA), heart failure, and thromboembolic (TE) events. TE events in adult CHD patients arise from various factors, including AA, intracardiac repairs, cyanotic CHD, Fontan palliation, pregnancy, and mechanical heart valves (MHV). As randomized clinical trials are lacking, most current guidelines rely on observational data and expert opinions, leading to inherent variability. While vitamin K antagonists are the only option for patients with MHV and significant mitral stenosis, direct oral anticoagulants appear to be a reasonable choice for other indications. In the presence of AA, complex conditions alone may justify anticoagulation, whereas thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risks should be evaluated individually for simpler lesions. This review summarizes the available evidence and makes relevant recommendations regarding thromboprophylaxis in ACHD patients, focusing on indications, risk scores, and therapies.",,,,© 2025 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.ijcchd.2025.100570

Novel agents that may reverse MDR and neutralize drug-resistant cancer cells are highly desirable for clinical practice. The targeting of cellular redox homeostasis and/or mitochondria-mediated energy metabolism are promising strategies for the suppression of drug-resistant cancer cells. Based on the structure of mono-gold(I) complex auranofin (AF), a drug candidate under clinical trials for cancer, we synthesized a new dual-gold(I) complex QB1561 and tested if it can inhibit drug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We also investigated if QB1561 could inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a well-known target of AF and other gold complexes, and assessed its impact on mitochondrial respiration.
Cell viability of drug-resistant cells upon QB1561 alone or combined with topotecan and mitoxantrone was determined by MTS assay. The expression of ABC sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) in the lung cancer cell line NCI-H460/MX20 after treatment with QB1561 was assessed by Western blot. The Vi-sensitive ABCG2 ATPase activity in the membrane vesicles of High Five insect cells, TrxR activity, and ROS production were measured following QB1561 treatment. Colony formation was used to assess QB1561's anticancer potential. SeaHorce Seahorse XF Analyzers were used to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR).

We investigated CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in rectal biopsies from 258 people without CF and 72 people with pancreatic-insufficient CF from 1 month to 68 years of age. Change in transepithelial short-circuit current in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated (100 μM IBMX, 1 µM forskolin, basolateral) and cholinergic (100 μM carbachol, basolateral) stimulation was assessed as a readout for CFTR function using perfused micro-Ussing chambers.

40066316,Cognitive control circuit function predicts antidepressant outcomes: A signal detection approach to actionable clinical decisions.,"Cognition, Depression, Functional neuroimaging, fMRI, Personalized, Prediction, Treatment",Personalized medicine in psychiatry,"We previously identified a cognitive biotype of depression characterized by dysfunction of the brain's cognitive control circuit, comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We evaluate these circuit metrics as personalized predictors of antidepressant remission.
We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the international Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression (iSPOT-D) for 159 patients who completed fMRI during a GoNoGo task, 8 weeks treatment with one of three study antidepressants and who were assessed for remission status (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of ≤ 7). Circuit predictors of remission were dLPFC and dACC activity and connectivity quantified in standard deviations. Using established software implementing receiver operating analysis (ROC) we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of these predictors at every cut-point for every circuit measure. We calculated number needed to treat (NNT) metrics for the ROC model identifying optimal cut-point values.
ROC models identified maximum separation of remitters (62.5%) from non-remitters (21.2%) at an initial cut-point of -0.75 standard deviations for dLPFC activity and averaged circuit metrics at secondary cutpoints. The NNT was 3.72, implying that if 4 patients (rounding of 3.72) were randomly selected, one would be likely to remit, but if circuit metrics informed treatment, two would be likely to remit.
Our findings contribute to identifying clinically actionable circuit measures for clinical trials and clinical practice.

This study investigated neural activities and correlates during different interactive modes.
Fifteen healthy participants (4M, 11F, age 21.93 ± 0.59 years) underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare cortical activation and functional connectivity (FC) across brain regions of interest (ROI) and channels (CH) during VR experiences. In the active mode (AM), participants engaged with the virtual environment through motor actions. In the passive mode (PM), participants stood still with their eyes closed, listening to the virtual environment's music.
A better analgesic effect was observed in the AM (t = 3.572, p = 0.001) with higher visual-sensorimotor cortical activation (t = 2.59 to 3.99, p = <0.001 to 0.015, p-FDR < 0.05). AM showed significant correlations between ratings (pain level and immersion) of VR questionnaire and visual-motor ROIs (r = 0.547 to 0.595, p = 0.013 to 0.038). PM only correlated with pain level and CH 37 (r = 0.608, p = 0.016). FC between S1 and visual-motor-auditory regions was lower in the AM (t = -4.64 to -3.53, p = 0.029 to 0.049).

However, current RT concepts for PCa have an imminent need to be rectified in order to modify the radiotherapeutic strategy by considering (i) the personal PCa biology in terms of radio resistance and (ii) the individual preferences of each patient.
To this end, a mechanistic multiscale model of prostate tumor response to external radiotherapeutic schemes, based on a discrete entity and discrete event simulation approach has been developed. Following technical verification, an adaptation to clinical data approach is delineated. Multiscale data has been provided by the University of Freiburg. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis has been performed.
The impact of model parameters such as cell cycle duration, dormant phase duration, apoptosis rate of living and progenitor cells, fraction of dormant stem and progenitor cells that reenter cell cycle, number of mitoses performed by progenitor cells before becoming differentiated, fraction of stem cells that perform symmetric division, fraction of cells entering the dormant phase following mitosis, alpha and beta parameters of the linear-quadratic model and oxygen enhancement ratio has been studied. The model has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the apoptosis rate of living stem and progenitor cells, the fraction of dormant stem and progenitor cells that reenter cell cycle, the fraction of stem cells that perform symmetric division and the fraction of cells entering the dormant phase following mitosis. A qualitative agreement of the model behavior with experimental and clinical knowledge has set the basis for the next steps towards its thorough clinical validation and its eventual certification and clinical translation.

Here, we describe a phase II, investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm trial (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials jRCTs052200017) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PADN over a 2-year observation period.
Twenty participants will be enrolled and will undergo PADN. The primary endpoint is the time from PADN to the first occurrence of the composite events of death, lung transplantation, and worsening of PH. The safety endpoints are the occurrence of adverse events related to PADN and bradycardia requiring treatment. The exploratory endpoints include right ventricular function evaluated using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and Short Form-36 score.

40066089,Association between human leukocyte antigen E expression and outcomes in solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"HLA-E, cancer, human leukocyte antigen, immunotherapy, solid tumors, survival",Frontiers in oncology,"Immunotherapy has gained momentum with the discovery of novel antibodies targeting immunosuppressive proteins. HLA-E, a non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) protein, exhibits immunosuppressive properties, potentially influencing tumor immune evasion mechanisms. The association between Human Leukocyte Antigen E (HLA-E) expression and outcomes in solid tumors remains unclear.
A systematic review of MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to March 15, 2024, was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating HLA-E expression in solid tumors and its association with OS and DFS were included. Statistical analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 3.0) with random-effects models.
After screening 657 articles, 11 studies were included, comprising a total of 1781 patients. The studies encompassed a variety of cancer types, follow-up periods, and staging details, with the majority focusing on non-metastatic cases. Notably, three studies evaluated colorectal cancer, while others focused on pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal cell, gastric, endometrial, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. The mean age of the patients was 59.81 ± 2.01 years, and the median follow-up period was 57.45 ± 8.91 months. HLA-E expression demonstrated no statistically significant association with OS (HR 0.913, 95% CI = 0.567-1.469; P=0.707), with significant heterogeneity observed (I2 = 84%). However, HLA-E non-expression was significantly associated with improved DFS (HR 1.406, 95% CI = 1.027-1.930; P=0.03), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 45%).
This systematic review highlights that HLA-E expression in solid tumors could be a biomarker of better prognosis, measured by DFS. These findings align with the clinical benefit observed for agents targeting this pathway. However, further studies should be performed to confirm these preliminary observations.

40066083,Dose-Response Study of Remimazolam Combined With Remifentanil for Attenuating Stress Response During Laryngeal Mask Airway Insertion in Elderly Female Patients: A Prospective Double-Blinded Study.,"dose-response, elderly patients, remifentanil, remimazolam, stress response","Drug design, development and therapy","Optimum dose of remimazolam for inducing loss of consciousness in elderly patients has been suggested by prior studies. Opioids can enhance their sedative effects, thereby permitting dose reduction. However, the dose-response of remimazolam when combined remifentanil for attenuating stress response during laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion in elderly female patients is still unknown. Moreover, the ideal dose of medications is especially critical in elderly patients due to their compromised cardiopulmonary function. The objective of this study was to determine the median effective dose (ED50) and ED95 of remimazolam in inhibiting the stress response associated with LMA insertion.
Sixty aged ≥ 65 and < 80 years old female patients were randomized allocated into 1 of 4 groups receiving doses of 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.35 mg/kg remimazolam. Following a dosage of 2.0 ng/mL of remifentanil, patients received different doses of remimazolam. Effective dose is defined as the prevention of stress response associated with LMA insertion, characterized by a post-sedation induction SBP variation < 20% of baseline value, jaw relaxation and absence of patient body motion during the initial 2 minutes following LMA insertion. Probit regression analysis was utilized to estimate the ED50 and ED90 values.
The ED50 and ED95 of effective remimazolam of general induction for elderly female patients not suffer intubation stress response were 0.24 mg/kg (95% CI 0.20-0.27 mg/kg) and 0.37 mg/kg (95% CI 0.32-0.49 mg/kg), respectively. The incidence of hypotension was 33.3% (5/15), 46.7% (7/15), 73.3% (11/15), and 80% (12/15) in the four groups, respectively.
The ED50 and ED95 values of intravenous remimazolam for preventing stress response during LMA insertion were 0.24 and 0.37 mg/kg, respectively in elderly female.

40066078,Recent advances and future directions in urinary system tissue engineering.,"Anti-inflammatory, Antibacterial, Antitumor, Tissue regeneration, Urinary system, Vascularization",Materials today. Bio,"Recent advancements in tissue engineering offer promising solutions for the repair and reconstruction of the urinary system, particularly in cases of urinary organ injuries. Historically, autologous tissue grafts and allografts have been the primary options for repairing damaged tissues. However, these approaches often lead to complications such as immune rejection, donor site morbidity, and functional limitations. Tissue engineering provides a more sustainable alternative by leveraging the potential of cells, bioactive scaffolds, and growth factors to regenerate and repair damaged tissues. This approach aims not only to restore tissue structure but also to enhance functional recovery. Key challenges in the field include achieving adequate vascularization, overcoming immune responses, and ensuring long-term tissue integration. Recent innovations, such as 3D bioprinting, stem cell-based therapies, and the development of novel biomaterials, show great promise in addressing these challenges. This review explores the current state of tissue engineering applications in the urological system, focusing on the regeneration of the bladder, urethra, and kidneys. We discuss recent breakthroughs, ongoing clinical trials, and emerging technologies, as well as the potential for these approaches to improve clinical outcomes. Finally, we outline critical future directions of tissue engineering in urology, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to overcome existing barriers and accelerate clinical translation.",,,,© 2025 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.101600

40065918,Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.,"Alzheimer's disease, MCID, anchor, clinical trials, meaningfulness, outcome measures","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)","The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine treatment benefit in clinical trials.
MCID is a key measure of within-person change in cognition, function, or behavior when it is applied to metrics of Alzheimer's disease progression.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID or minimum within person change (MWPC) can function as useful means of determining if a patient has progressed to thresholds of detectable change.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID/MWPC can be used to determine the number or percent of individuals who have progressed to detectable levels of within-person change, with differences anticipated in active treatment and placebo groups.MCID/MWPC are not measures that are appropriately applied to group outcomes of clinical trials.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

40065915,Enhancing HRQoL assessment for economic evaluation in dementia populations.,"EQ‐5D, dementia, health‐related quality of life, patient‐reported outcomes, proxy report, psychometrics","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)","This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of EQ-5D instrument administration methods and proxy selection for evaluating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in dementia populations. EQ-5D is a widely used measure of HRQoL and is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for cost-effectiveness analyses of health interventions.
Individual-level data from three trials were analyzed separately to evaluate missing data rates, inter-rater agreement, responsiveness, and predictors of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L) dimensions and index values. The study used psychometric analyses, correlations, and multivariate linear regression models to evaluate EQ-5D dimension reports. Reports from both people with dementia (PwD) and proxies were compared to assess reliability across different settings and proxy types.
Proxy-reported EQ-5D achieved higher completion rates compared to reports from PwD, with proxies showing greater responsiveness to changes in symptom scores over time. Face-to-face instrument administration for informal proxies was favored over postal methods, and proxy selection was found to be crucial, with informal proxies recommended for community-dwelling PwD and staff proxies for institutionalized populations. Inter-rater agreement was strongest for the ""mobility"" dimension, with differences in reporting by dimension. Novel guidelines on integrating EQ-5D data reported by PwD and proxies are proposed. Combining self- and proxy-reported data to generate an integrated utility score potentially reflects a more holistic perspective and may enhance the accuracy of HRQoL assessment, compared to relying solely on one respondent's reports.
The importance of careful administration and proxy selection for HRQoL data collection and application in dementia trials and studies is highlighted. These findings have implications for informing economic evaluations of dementia interventions, emphasizing the potential need for tailoring approaches to HRQoL assessment based on the residential status of the PwD.
The EQ-5D is a widely used measure in dementia trials, but challenges like missing data and discrepancies in inter-rater agreement highlight complexities in assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL), especially in advanced stages.This study empirically examines the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of EQ-5D data from people with dementia and proxies, using individual-level data from three trials.Recommendations are provided to improve data collection practices, enhancing the reliability of HRQoL assessments in clinical trials for dementia interventions.Optimized proxy selection criteria and administration methods tailored to residential status can improve HRQoL assessments, supporting more accurate economic evaluations and better-informed care decisions.",,"Proxy-reported EQ-5D achieved higher completion rates compared to reports from PwD, with proxies showing greater responsiveness to changes in symptom scores over time.

We conducted a population-based household telephone survey with Latino adults (N = 1264), with 68 % Mexican/Mexican American, 11 % Central/South American, 8 % Puerto Rican and the remaining 13 % self-identified as ""Other"". The ""Building Trust Survey,"" included valid standardized instruments designed to assess knowledge of research, human subjects' protections, previous participation in research, immigrant status (nativity), length of time in the US, and country of origin.

Willingness to ""take"" something in a study varied by Latino subgroup, immigration age, gender, and age.

A literature review was conducted in the PubMed / MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases using related keywords, i.e., ""retinopathy of prematurity,"" ""retinal development,"" ""pathophysiology,"" ""vascular growth,"" ""complications,"" ""visual outcomes,"" ""maternal health factors,"" ""obstetrics,"" ""preeclampsia,"" ""risk factors,"" ""preterm birth,"" ""corticosteroids,"" ""oxygen management,"" ""treatment strategies,"" ""laser therapy,"" ""anti-VEGF agents,"" ""surgical approaches"", and ""artificial intelligence (AI)"" and targeting English studies published in the last 20 years. Additionally, the references from the selected articles were manually reviewed. Clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, case-control studies, case series, narrative reviews, pilot studies, and relevant animal studies were included.
Maternal factors, such as diabetes, smoking, and preeclampsia, along with neonatal factors, such as low gestational age and extreme prematurity, are critical contributors to ROP. Key preventative strategies to reduce the risk of ROP and improve neonatal outcomes include: 1. prenatal care involves screening and managing maternal conditions, providing maternal education, and administering antenatal corticosteroids. 2. Neonatal care encompasses nutritional support, supplementation with essential fatty acids, and regulated oxygen administration. By focusing on these strategies, we can enhance the health of newborns at risk for ROP. Advances in screening, including artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostics and advanced imaging, are improving early detection. Treatment modalities such as laser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapies have shown promise but pose challenges, including recurrence risk and systemic side effects.
ROP continues to pose a major threat to the vision of preterm infants, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources. Addressing ROP requires multidisciplinary team approaches that integrate obstetric and neonatal care. Preventative strategies, including prenatal care optimization, oxygen management, and nutritional support, are essential. Future efforts should focus on integrating emerging technologies and recent findings to ensure global relevance and currency.",,"Maternal factors, such as diabetes, smoking, and preeclampsia, along with neonatal factors, such as low gestational age and extreme prematurity, are critical contributors to ROP.

This review aims to highlight the advances in understanding refractory GCT and review upcoming and active clinical trials with novel therapeutics in development.
Patients with refractory disease after optimal salvage chemotherapy are rarely cured and should be referred to centers with expertise in GCT. While prior investigational agents have not overcome current limitations of salvage therapy, current and upcoming trials of novel agents including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are promising avenues of therapy.
Outcomes in refractory GCT remain poor.

An overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses found that burnout is highly prevalent among oncologists and oncology nurses, mainly emotional exhaustion. However, these meta-analyses showed a lack of original research from continents such as Africa or Oceania, and no studies were meta-analyzed evaluating physical therapists or psycho-oncologists. To our knowledge, the incidence of occupational burnout has not been meta-analyzed on this topic, and the number of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials is probably limited. On the other hand, some cross-sectional studies and nonrandomized clinical trials have been recently published. These studies have highlighted the association between burnout with psychological (e.g. anxiety) and occupational factors (e.g. job demands) and the reduction of burnout using different psychological interventions.
Occupational burnout is a topic of interest in oncology.

40065476,Caregivers and multidisciplinary team members' perspectives on shared decision making in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A qualitative study.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Informational needs, Interprofessional model of shared decision making, Multidisciplinary team, Patient decision aids, Patient engagement",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,"As new therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are entering the market, shared decision making (SDM) will become increasingly important. Therefore, this study aimed to understand (1) Belgian stakeholders' knowledge and perceptions of SDM in DMD treatment decision making, (2) the current state of SDM implementation in DMD in Belgium, examining the role of all involved parties, and (3) the barriers and facilitators for SDM in DMD in the Belgian context.
In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews with the multidisciplinary team (MDT) of individuals with DMD (n = 18) and caregivers thereof (n = 11) were conducted in Belgium. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically using the framework method.
Most caregivers were unfamiliar with the term SDM, while MDT members were aware of it but struggled to define it consistent with existing literature. Despite acknowledging some drawbacks, participants valued SDM as an important process in DMD care, noting its presence in current practice. However, both MDT members and caregivers sometimes questioned the necessity of SDM due to limited treatment options available. Consequently, decision making predominantly relied on (child) neurologists sharing information and seeking consent from caregivers and individuals with DMD for a proposed treatment. Participants highlighted the important role of the MDT, with each professional contributing its unique expertise to SDM. To reduce existing barriers and enhance the SDM process, participants called for clear and transparent information regarding different treatment options, including clinical trials, and detailed information on how treatments might affect patients' daily life.
This study identified an increased need for easily understandable information, particularly regarding DMD care in general, but also about clinical trials covering new and emerging therapies. Developing specific evidence-based tools could support stakeholders' understanding of this information, thereby enhancing implementation of the SDM process in DMD care. Further, as the treatment landscape of DMD evolves, it will become increasingly important for patients to be supported by an MDT, as they can provide information on clinical trials (e.g., study coordinators), emotional support (e.g., psychologists, nurses), and decisional guidance (e.g., neurologist).",,"Most caregivers were unfamiliar with the term SDM, while MDT members were aware of it but struggled to define it consistent with existing literature.

However, there is limited understanding and no systematic review of oncological endpoints in cancer cachexia (CC) trials. This review examines oncological endpoints in CC clinical trials.
An electronic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases (1990-2023) was performed. Eligibility criteria comprised participants ≥ 18 years old; controlled design; ≥ 40 participants; and a cachexia intervention for > 14 days. Trials reporting at least one oncological endpoint were selected for analysis. Data extraction was performed using Covidence and followed PRISMA guidelines and the review was registered (PROSPERO CRD42022276710).
Fifty-seven trials were eligible, totalling 9743 patients (median: 107, IQR: 173). Twenty-six (46%) trials focussed on a single tumour site: eight in lung, six in pancreatic, six in head and neck and six in GI cancers. Forty-two (74%) studies included patients with Stage III/IV disease, and 41 (70%) included patients receiving palliative anti-cancer treatment. Ten studies (18%) involved patients on curative treatment. Twenty-eight (49%) studies used pharmacological interventions, 29 (50%) used oral nutrition, and two (4%) used enteral or parenteral nutrition. Reported oncological endpoints included overall survival (OS, n = 46 trials), progression-free survival (PFS, n = 7), duration of response (DR, n = 1), response rate (RR, n = 9), completion of treatment (TC, n = 11) and toxicity/adverse events (AE, n = 42). Median OS differed widely from 60 to 3468 days. Of the 46 studies, only three reported a significant positive effect on survival. Seven trials showed a difference in AE, four in TC, one in PFS and one in RR. Reported significances were unreliable due to missing adjustments for extensive multiple testing. Only three of the six trials using OS as the primary endpoint reported pre-trial sample size calculations, but only one recruited the planned number of patients.
In CC trials, oncological endpoints were mostly secondary and only few significant findings have been reported. Due to heterogeneity in oncological settings, nutritional and metabolic status and interventions, firm conclusions about CC treatment are not possible. OS and AE are relevant endpoints, but future trials targeting clinically meaningful hazard ratios will required more homogeneous patient cohorts, adequate pre-trial power analyses and adherence to statistical testing standards.",,"Fifty-seven trials were eligible, totalling 9743 patients (median: 107, IQR: 173).

Despite interventions include targeted goals on essential aspects such as physical activity and diet, their long-term effectiveness remains limited. Research highlights that eating behaviour is influenced by impulsive processes, especially in the context of a food-rich environment. Inhibitory control has been identified as a key factor in regulating eating behaviour. Neuroscience approaches, including inhibitory control training and non-invasive neuromodulation of brain regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, show promise in improving eating behaviour when used in addition to conventional intervention for weight management. This parallel group, randomized, controlled trial aims to study the efficacy of neuromodulation with iTBS as an add-on to the weight loss treatment as usual (TAU: diet and exercise), alone and in combination with inhibitory control training, for excess weight treatment.
141 people with excess weight will be randomized into three groups: combined intervention (inhibitory control training + iTBS), iTBS and sham iTBS. The three groups will receive individualized diet and physical exercise guidelines (TAU). The interventions will comprehend ten sessions along two weeks. The main outcome measure will be the Body Mass Index change. Secondary outcomes include changes in brain connectivity and activation using fMRI, cognitive measures, eating and physical exercise behaviours, anthropometric and biological measures. Assessments will be carried out before the intervention, after the intervention and 3 months after the intervention. In addition, data on the use of the health system will be collected to analyse the cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility of the intervention.
Findings of this study will expand the available evidence on cognitive interventions to improve eating behaviour in people with excess weight.

40065417,Shaping cancer center priorities through Community Advisory Board collaboration.,"Cancer, Community Advisory Board, Community outreach and engagement, Priorities, Strategic planning",Research involvement and engagement,"Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) teams at National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers are tasked with engaging communities to understand and address the burden of cancer within their catchment area. This helps cancer center leadership identify priorities and develop strategic plans to reduce the cancer burden. University of Iowa Health Care Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center collaborates with its Community Advisory Board (CAB) to understand the needs and priorities of its catchment area, the state of Iowa.
The Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center's CAB is made up of diverse individuals from across the state, including community leaders and representatives from local hospitals, health departments, and nonprofits, who are dedicated to partnering with Holden Cancer Center to reduce the state's cancer burden. Holden Cancer Center's COE team engaged its CAB in conversations to establish a process to identify research, clinical, and outreach priorities for the Holden Cancer Center. Small- and whole-group dialogues during CAB meetings helped gauge important criteria for determining priorities. The COE team also conducted online surveys to quantitatively assess CAB perspectives on guiding criteria for Holden Cancer Center to consider when identifying priorities.
Over the course of three interactive meetings, CAB members refined and ranked criteria for selecting Holden Cancer Center priorities. The top guiding criteria identified by CAB members included barriers patients face to cancer treatment, screening, or clinical trials; preventable cancers; and achieving health equity or correcting health disparities in the state.
The COE team, Holden Cancer Center leadership, and CAB members are exploring avenues to inform Holden Cancer Center research and program planning with priorities developed using the CAB-identified guiding criteria. The multi-step process employed by Holden Cancer Center to engage community members in the identification and creation of priorities can be adapted by other cancer centers to ensure that institutional and community priorities are aligned.

This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with no blinding in which we tested two groups of intervention control. 90 patients having undergone coronary angioplasty were allocated to an intervention (N = 45) and a control group randomly (N = 45). Data were collected from January to October 2022. The data collection instruments comprised angioplasty patients' treatment adherence questionnaire, Walker's health-promoting lifestyle profile questionnaire, and Snyder's Hope Scale. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 23. To analyze the data, we used descriptive statistics. Accordingly, inferential statistics applied included chi-square, independent-samples t-test, and repeated measures (ANOVA). Significance level was considered as p < 0.05.
The mean scores of lifestyle, hope, and treatment adherence in the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group as measured immediately and three months after the intervention (p < 0.05).

40065414,Comparative safety signals of dopamine agonists: psychiatric and cardiovascular risks derived from FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) data.,"Adverse events, Dopamine receptor agonists, FAERS, Psychiatric disorders, Risk signal mining",BMC pharmacology & toxicology,"Dopamine receptor agonists (DAs) are widely used as first-line therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease. However, comparative clinical trials assessing their safety profiles are limited. This study aims to compare adverse event (AE) data across various DAs to inform personalized treatment strategies.
AE reports with DAs as the ""primary suspicion (PS)"" were extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering 67 quarters from the second quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2023. Four disproportionality analysis methods, including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), were employed to evaluate the risk of AEs.
A total of 19,745,533 DA-related AEs reports were analyzed. The six DAs-pramipexole, ropinirole, cabergoline, rotigotine, bromocriptine and apomorphine-generated 269, 246, 202, 163, 146, and 135 preferred terms positive signals, respectively. Non-ergot DAs (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine and apomorphine) were primarily associated with psychiatric disorders and reported more hallucinations than ergot-derived dopamine agonists (ergot-DAs), with ropinirole showing a slightly higher signal intensity than pramipexole (ROR = 15.76 vs. 11.23). Pramipexole demonstrated the most significant signal for impulse control disorders (ICDs). Compared with pramipexole and ropinirole, rotigotine generally exhibits milder signals in terms of psychiatric disorders such as hallucinations, ICDs, and sleep-related AEs. Administration site-related AEs were more prominent in rotigotine and apomorphine users. Ergot-DAs exhibited higher signal intensities for cardiac disorders, with cabergoline also showing a notable signal for amnestic symptoms (ROR = 340.54), which is not mentioned in the drug label.
This study elucidates the distinct safety profiles of six DAs. Non-ergot DAs are primarily associated with psychiatric AEs, while administration-related AEs are more notable for rotigotine and apomorphine.

40065381,Key interventions and outcomes in perioperative care pathways in emergency laparotomy: a systematic review.,"Emergency laparotomy, Emergency surgery, Pathways",World journal of emergency surgery : WJES,"Emergency laparotomy (EmLap) is a complex clinical arena, delivering time-sensitive, definitive care to a high-risk patient cohort, with significant rates of post-operative morbidity and mortality. Embedding perioperative care pathways within this complex setting has the potential to improve post-operative outcomes, however, requires an in-depth understanding of their design, delivery and outcome assessment. Delivering and implementing complex interventions such as perioperative pathways require transparent reporting with detailed and indepth description of all components during the assessment and evaluation phase. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the current design and reporting of perioperative pathways in the EmLap setting.
The OVID SP versions of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched between January 1950 and December 2023. All randomised and non-randomised cohort studies reporting outcomes on perioperative care pathways in adult patients (> 18 years old) undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery were included. A narrative description of all perioperative pathways included was reported to identify design and description of the pathway including the delivery and timing of component interventions. All pathways were evaluated against the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist.
Eleven RCTs and 19 non-randomised studies were identified, with most studies considered to be at moderate risk of bias. Twenty-six unique pathways were identified and described, delivering a total of 400 component interventions across 44,055 patients. Component interventions were classified into 24 domains across the perioperative pathway. Twenty studies (66.6%) did not report the TIDieR framework items, with thirteen studies reporting less than 50% of all items. Two hundred and fifty individual outcomes were reported across pathways, with the most commonly reported outcomes related to morbidity, mortality and length of stay.
Current perioperative pathways in EmLap setting are underpinned by variable component interventions, with a lack of in-depth intervention reporting and evaluation. Future studies should incorporate the TIDieR checklist when reporting on perioperative pathways in the EmLap setting.

Flatfoot and weakness of the hip and core muscles have been introduced as distal and proximal factors associated with this syndrome, respectively. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a combination of a proximal strengthening exercise (PSE) program and a foot orthosis (PSEFO) on pain and function in women with PFPS and a pronated foot (PF).
In this randomized clinical trial (RCT), 117 female patients aged 18-40 years will be recruited through online announcements on cyberspace as well as those installed in rehabilitation and healthcare centers and gyms. Considering the inclusion criteria, the participants will be randomized into three groups of 39 (group I: practicing PSEs and wearing PSEFO; group II: practicing only PSEs; and group III: control group [CG]). Randomization will be conducted using the sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope (SNOSE) technique. The intervention groups (groups I and II) will perform PSEs at gyms for 2 months at the rate of three sessions per week (each session lasting 45-60 min) under the guidance of a trainer. In addition to the PSE, group I participants will receive prefabricated polyurethane FOs with an 8° varus wedge. They will be asked to wear the orthosis for 2 h a day and then slowly increase their wearing time to a full day. The CG participants will follow their routine lives during this study. Pain, as the primary outcome, will be measured by the visual analog scale before and after the 8-week intervention program. Additionally, quality of life, disability, Q angle, performance, and dynamic balance will be evaluated as secondary outcomes using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey, the Kujala score, a goniometer, the step-down test, the unilateral squat test, the anteromedial lunge test, the bilateral squat test, and the Y-balance test, respectively.
In this RCT, the effectiveness of PSEs focusing on the hip and core muscles, with and without FOs, on pain and performance among women with PFPS and PF will be investigated and compared.

40065346,The effect of a smartphone-based application on the self-efficacy of heart valve surgery patients and their family caregivers` burden: a randomized clinical trial.,"Care burden, Educational program, Family caregivers, Heart valve surgery, Self-efficacy, Smartphone App",BMC nursing,"Heart valve replacement has many complications that affect patients and their family caregivers. Increasing patients' self-efficacy in dealing with complications and reducing the care burden of their caregivers are among the critical factors that impact their quality of life. Today, smartphone Apps allow access to reliable information without time and place restrictions. It also facilitates teaching and learning through low-cost and easily accessible methods.
This study was conducted to examine the effect of a smartphone App on the care burden of family caregivers and self-efficacy of patients undergoing heart valve surgery.
A randomized clinical trial study with a pre-test / post-test design was conducted. Sixty patients undergoing mechanical heart valve surgery were referred to the Shahid Modarres Hospital and PT clinic in Tehran, and their family caregivers were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The App was installed on the patients' smartphones for educational purposes, and they were given 8 weeks to use it. Sullivan's cardiac self-efficacy questionnaire and Novak and Guest's care burden questionnaire were completed for patients and their caregivers in both groups before and after the intervention, respectively. Data was statistically analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics through SPSS-18 software.
There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding demographic characteristics and the mean scores of self-efficacy and care burden before the intervention. However, after the intervention, the mean self-efficacy score increased to 47.43 ± 5.43 in the intervention group and 32.23 ± 3.25 in the control group, showing a significant improvement in patients' self-efficacy in the intervention group (P < 0.001). Although the mean self-efficacy score slightly increased in the control group, this increase was not statistically significant (P = 0.094). Furthermore, the mean score of care burden of caregivers after the intervention increased to 45.33 ± 6.34 in the intervention group and 53.86 ± 6.80 in the control group, showing a significant decrease in the care burden of caregivers in the intervention group compared to those in the control group (P < 0.001).
Based on the results, the designed smartphone App improved the self-efficacy of patients undergoing heart valve surgery while reducing the care burden of their family caregivers. Therefore, this App is recommended due to its effectiveness, ease of use, and low cost.

40065328,Extraction of a stromal metastatic gene signature in breast cancer via spatial profiling.,"Metastatic disease, Prognostic biomarker, Spatial transcriptomics, Stromal microenvironment",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,"The identification of molecular features characterizing metastatic disease is a critical area of oncology research, as metastatic foci often exhibit distinct biological behaviors compared to primary tumors. While the focus has largely been on the neoplastic cells themselves, the characterization of the associated stroma remains largely underexplored, with significant implications for understanding metastasis.
By employing spatially resolved transcriptomics, we analyzed the transcriptional features of primary breast adenocarcinoma and its associated metastatic foci, on a representative set of microregions. We identified a stromal metastatic (Met) signature, which was subsequently validated across transcriptomic reference human breast cancer (BC) datasets and in spatial transcriptomics of a murine model.
We discuss the potential of a stromal Met signature to pinpoint metastatic breast cancer, serving as a prognostic tool that can provide a foundation for the exploration of tumor-extrinsic molecular hallmarks of BC metastatic foci.",,,"We discuss the potential of a stromal Met signature to pinpoint metastatic breast cancer, serving as a prognostic tool that can provide a foundation for the exploration of tumor-extrinsic molecular hallmarks of BC metastatic foci.",© 2025.

40065317,Influence of combined transcranial and peripheral electromagnetic stimulation on the autonomous nerve system on delayed onset muscle soreness in young athletes: a randomized clinical trial.,"Athletes, Delayed onset muscle soreness, Heart rate variability, Peripheral electromagnetic stimulation, Recovery, Transcranial electromagnetic stimulation",Journal of translational medicine,"Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) represents a common challenge for athletes and has been a focal point of research in sports science. Eccentric exercise, known to induce DOMS, significantly impacts recovery and physiological processes. Electromagnetic stimulation, both transcranial and peripheral, has gained attention in sports medicine due to its demonstrated benefits in various conditions, offering potential as a recovery-enhancing tool for athletes.
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of combined transcranial and peripheral electromagnetic stimulation on the autonomic nervous system response and recovery in young athletes experiencing DOMS.
A randomized, double-blind study was conducted with 48 young athletes divided into four groups: Control (n = 12), Peripheral Stimulation (n = 13), Transcranial Stimulation (n = 11), and Combined Stimulation (n = 12). Participants underwent an eccentric exercise session to induce DOMS, followed by their respective interventions: no stimulation for the Control group, 5 min of peripheral electromagnetic stimulation (LTP protocol) for the Peripheral group, 20 min of transcranial stimulation for the Transcranial group, and a combination of both (30 min total) for the Combined group. The autonomic nervous system was assessed through Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters measured before, immediately after, and at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-intervention.
The Combined Stimulation group exhibited significant improvements in HRV parameters, including increased Low Frequency (LF, p < 0.001), High Frequency (HF, p < 0.001), and LF/HF power ratio (p < 0.001) at 72 h post-intervention compared to other groups. These findings suggest that paired-associative electromagnetic stimulation effectively enhances autonomic regulation and promotes recovery after eccentric exercise-induced DOMS.
Combined transcranial and peripheral electromagnetic stimulation positively influences autonomic nervous system responses, accelerating recovery in young athletes without disrupting natural physiological recovery mechanisms. This approach presents a promising recovery intervention for athletes experiencing DOMS.",,"The Combined Stimulation group exhibited significant improvements in HRV parameters, including increased Low Frequency (LF, p < 0.001), High Frequency (HF, p < 0.001), and LF/HF power ratio (p < 0.001) at 72 h post-intervention compared to other groups.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and respiratory stimulant drugs are used to treat this condition. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause breathing stimulation and hyperventilation. This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of MPA in hypercapnic exacerbated COPD patients and the possibility of faster weaning of patients from NIV.
This double-blind clinical trial was conducted on consecutive exacerbated COD patients referred to Shahid Rahnemoun Hospital, Yazd, Iran, from February 2022 to August 2022. Through a block randomized sampling method with a 1:1 allocation ratio, 58 eligible patients with hypercapnic exacerbated COPD on NIV were divided into two study groups: the intervention (treated with MPA 10 mg every 8 h) and the control (treated with placebo). The clinical and arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters were investigated in both groups.
Out of 50 patients, 27 and 23 intervention and control arms cases were analyzed. Although there was a significant difference in the amount of ABG parameters during the study in each group, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Also, There was no significant difference in the total weaning rate of the patients in the two groups. Despite the higher number of early weaning in the MPA group, no significant difference was reported between the two groups in this regard. In addition, there was no difference between the two groups in the rate of ICU hospitalization, the length of stay of hospitalization and ICU, and the mortality rate.

The heterogeneous nature of PCa prompts a need for precision treatment. This study aims to verify whether genomic biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced PCa and OMPCa can result in an improvement in the pathological responses and survival outcomes in a Chinese population.
In this open-label prospective phase II umbrella clinical trial, 40 patients will be enrolled. Next-generation sequencing data analysis of PCa tissues from the diagnostic needle biopsies will be performed. The genomically evaluable patients will be divided into 4 groups on the basis of genomic testing results, and receive 6 cycles of patient-tailored neoadjuvant systemic therapy targeted to alternative molecular pathways (including parmiparib, cisplatin, tislelizumab or docetaxel, respectively), and both in combination with rezvilutamide and goserelin microspheres. The primary endpoint is the rate of pathologic complete response. Secondary endpoints include rates of clinical complete response and pathological minimal residual disease (defined as residual tumor 5 mm or less), overall survival, progression-free survival and safety outcomes.
SEGNO, to the best of our knowledge, is the first umbrella clinical trial designed to provide high-level evidence to support the implementation of genomic biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced PCa and OMPCa.

Our research in eastern Uganda aimed to assess the prevalence of congenital CMV and outcomes among infants to inform public health policies and interventions in similar settings, addressing a significant gap in current knowledge.
We conducted a descriptive study, nested within the BabyGel Trial, across Mbale and Budaka districts in eastern Uganda, between May 2023 and January 2024. Infants underwent saliva sampling within the first week of life, which was validated through urine polymerase chain reaction testing within the first 21 days of life. At three months of age, a cranial ultrasound examination, neurological examination, developmental evaluation, and audiological assessment were conducted for all infants diagnosed with congenital CMV infection. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 17.0.
Congenital CMV infection was found in 5 out of 1,265 newborns tested, indicating a prevalence of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.96). Of these 5 infected infants, two experienced febrile illness at birth and required hospitalisation within the first week of life, and three had findings on ultrasound examination consistent with congenital cytomegalovirus during the neonatal period. Audiologic follow-up until three months of age revealed that three infants had failed unilateral and bilateral hearing screening. Neurodevelopment assessments using the Malawi Development Assessment Tool fell within optimal ranges for all 5 infants; however, when evaluated using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, four infants scored below optimal levels.
Our community-based study revealed a low prevalence of congenital CMV infection. Further longitudinal multi-site research is needed to assess the generalisability of these findings.

40065171,Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell therapy with laromestrocel in mild Alzheimer's disease: a randomized controlled phase 2a trial.,,Nature medicine,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, severe brain atrophy and neuroinflammation. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .",,,,© 2025. The Author(s).,"10.1038/s41591-025-03559-0

40065153,Integrating model systems and genomic insights to decipher mechanisms of cancer metastasis.,,Nature reviews. Genetics,"Deciphering metastatic processes is crucial for understanding cancer progression and potential treatment options. Genetic studies of model systems engineered to mimic metastatic disease, including organoids, genetically engineered mice and human cell lines, have had an important role in shaping our understanding of the metastatic cascade and how it can be manipulated. More recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled human metastases to be studied at single-cell and single-nucleotide resolution, providing insights into metastatic evolution and phenotypes of both cancer cells and immune cells. However, human tissue studies are often correlative and descriptive, whereas experimental models are reductionistic by nature, meaning that individual results should be interpreted with caution. Crucially, these seemingly disparate branches of metastasis research can and should complement each other to strengthen and validate findings. Here we explore the synergies between model systems and sequencing studies and outline key areas that must be explored to improve our understanding of the metastatic process.",,,,© 2025.

40065106,A nationwide comprehensive genomic profiling and molecular tumor board platform for patients with advanced cancer.,,NPJ precision oncology,"The Belgian Approach for Local Laboratory Extensive Tumor Testing (BALLETT) study assessed the feasibility of using comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in clinical decision-making for patients with advanced cancers. This multi-center study enrolled 872 patients from 12 Belgian hospitals. CGP was performed on tumor tissues using a standardized CGP panel (523 genes) across nine laboratories with success in 93% of patients and a median turnaround time of 29 days. Actionable genomic markers were identified in 81% of patients, substantially higher than the 21% using nationally reimbursed, small panels. A national molecular tumor board (nMTB) recommended treatments for 69% of patients, with 23% receiving matched therapies. Reasons for non-compliance were highly variable across clinical sites. Overall, BALLETT demonstrates the feasibility of implementing decentralized CGP and its potential to identify actionable targets in most patients with advanced cancers. BALLETT reinforces CGP's utility and emphasizes the importance of collaboration, standardization, and addressing implementation challenges.",,,,© 2025. The Author(s).,"10.1038/s41698-025-00858-0

40065086,Time in target range of systolic blood pressure and eGFR slope in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Hypertension, Time in target range, Type 2 diabetes, eGFR slope",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,"Time in target range (TTR) of systolic blood pressure is a novel measure to assess the effect of blood pressure control. However, few studies have explored the renoprotective value of systolic TTR in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We analyzed the database of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) blood pressure (BP) trial. The systolic target range was established as 120-140 and 110-130 mm Hg for the standard group and intensive therapy, respectively. Multivariate linear regression was conducted to evaluate the relationship between systolic blood pressure and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. After adjusting for covariates, systolic TTR showed a significant and positive association with two measures of eGFR slope (n = 4327, P < 0.04). The correlation of systolic TTR and eGFR slope was notably stronger in CKD patients (n = 1635) compared to those without (P for interaction < 0.05). When analyzing systolic TTR as a categorical variable, participants with CKD in the highest systolic TTR quantile had a significantly positive relationship with eGFR slope (P ≤ 0.0001). These findings were consistently observed across further subgroup analyses. Among T2D patients, systolic TTR exhibited a significant and positive relation to eGFR slope, with a stronger relationship noted in individuals diagnosed with CKD. This underscores the critical role of stable blood pressure control for renoprotection in patients with T2D, particularly in those with CKD.

The present study aimed to examine the efficacy of MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet on the anthropometric measurements, sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and serum levels of cortisol and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in type 2 diabetic women with insomnia. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) involved 44 type 2 diabetic women with insomnia, aged 30 to 65 years, who were randomly assigned to be under the MIND low-calorie diet (n = 22) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) as the control group (n = 22) for 12 weeks. The above-mentioned variables were assessed at the beginning and the end of intervention. Following the MIND diet for 12 weeks accompanied by the significant decrease of waist circumference and significant improvement of sleep quality, depression, and anxiety compared to the control group. In addition, the MIND diet vs. LCD group exhibited a significant reduction in the cortisol levels and a significant increase in BDNF. This study provides promising evidence of the effectiveness of the MIND diet in improving the sleep quality, mental health, and some related biochemical parameters in diabetic women with insomnia.Trial registration: IRCT20181111041611N8.",,,,© 2025.

40064980,Impact of adapted physical activity and diet counselling on health-related quality of life in women undergoing adjuvant breast cancer therapy.,"Breast cancer, Clinical trial, Health-related quality of life, Linear mixed models, Longitudinal data, Time to deterioration",Scientific reports,"In the monocentric APAD1 trial, 143 women with non-metastatic breast cancer were randomised to undergo either an adapted physical activity and diet counselling (APAD) program or usual care. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was prospectively evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire at baseline, during treatment (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) and during follow-up. Our objective was two-fold: to analyse the impact of APAD on HRQoL using three approaches; to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and derive methodological recommendations. Analytical approaches utilised were: statistical testing to compare the mean HRQoL scores between baseline and end of study in both groups and the mean HRQoL scores between the two groups at the different assessment times; linear mixed models that modelled the longitudinal score data in both groups and tested whether the score trajectories were different between the groups; a survival analysis comparing the time to deterioration of HRQoL between the groups using a minimal clinically important difference. This study shows a substantial clinical benefit of the APAD intervention on HRQoL, especially for global health status/HRQoL, functioning scales and the fatigue symptom scale. Furthermore, this study highlights the advantages and disadvantages of three standard approaches used to analyse HRQoL data.Trial registration: The APAD1 study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01495650, date 20/12/2011).",,,,© 2025.

Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.",,,,© 2025.

40064963,Association between serum uric acid levels and bone mineral density in Chinese and American: a cross-sectional study.,"Bone mineral density, Threshold effect, Uric acid",Scientific reports,"Despite extensive studies conducted on the relationship between serum uric acid (UA) and bone mineral density (BMD), their association remains controversial. In this study, we investigated whether UA levels are independently associated with BMD in Chinese and American populations to elucidate their association. Herein, the data of 12,344 individuals (age > 20 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2018) and those of 768 individuals from the inpatient medical records and physical examination center systems of the Tertiary Class A Hospital (2021-2023) from China were included. The association between UA and BMD was analyzed by employing multivariate regression models with covariate adjustments. In addition, population description, stratified analysis, single-factor analysis, smooth-curve fitting, and threshold and saturation effect analyses were performed. After covariate adjustments, UA exhibited an association with BMD of the femur (β = 0.008, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.015, P = 0.02), femoral neck (β = 0.011, 95% CI 0.004-0.018, P = 0.002), and lumbar spine (β = 0.014, 95% CI 0.06-0.022, P < 0.001) in American subjects. Similarly, UA exhibited association with BMD of the femur (β = 0.079, 95% CI 0.042-0.117, P < 0.001), femoral neck (β = 0.171, 95% CI 0.121-0.22, P < 0.001), and lumbar spine (β = 0.052, 95% CI 0.007-0.097, P = 0.024) in Chinese subjects. Notably, the relationship between UA levels and BMD was nonlinear. The saturated utility values for determining the UA level with BMD of the femur and femoral neck using a two-stage linear regression model were 429.9 and 468 μmol/L, respectively, in the Chinese population. In the American population, the saturated utility values of UA level with BMD of the femur, femoral neck, and lumbar spine were 410.4, 410.4, and 452 μmol/L, respectively. Altogether, the present findings suggested a positive association between the UA levels and overall BMD in adults, implying that maintaining saturated UA levels can facilitate osteoporosis prevention.China Clinical Trials Registry: MR-51-23-051741. https://www.medicalresearch.org.cn/search/research/researchViewid=c0e5f868-eca9-4c68-af58-d73460c34028 .",,,,© 2025.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the long-term outcome of 1-year subclinical DES-EE (sDES-EE), which was defined as any reduction in the minimal lumen area (MLA) at stent edge without any evidence of clinical ischemia. A total of 252 patients were enrolled from one of our previous randomized controlled studies, who were detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) immediately after DES implantation and 1 year later. The primary endpoint was EE-related target lesion failure (EE-TLF) at 5 years. Secondary endpoints were the changes of morphologies and composition of stent edge plaque, and each component of EE-TLF. sDES-EE at 1 year was significantly correlated with EE-TLF at 5 years by binary logistic regression analysis after propensity scoring. The most valuable cutoff value of sDES-EE at 1 year was a 25% MLA reduction at the stent edge, according to receiver operating characteristic analysis, which showed a major increase in lipid normalized total volume (0.99 ± 0.25 mm

40064861,Impact of liver fibrosis on AAV-mediated gene transfer to mouse hepatocytes.,,Nature communications,"Liver fibrosis, characterized by scar tissue accumulation due to liver injury, poses significant barriers to liver-targeted gene therapy. Current clinical trials exclude patients with fibrosis, as intact liver architecture is considered essential for efficient and safe adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-mediated gene delivery. Here, we show that liver fibrosis reduces the efficiency of hepatocyte transduction by AAV8 vectors across three mouse models with diverse fibrotic patterns. This inefficiency stems primarily from decreased vector uptake by the liver rather than loss of vector genomes due to hepatocyte turnover. Additionally, fibrosis alters blood vector clearance and redistributes AAV particles to extra-hepatic organs, such as spleen, lung, and kidney. At the cellular level, fibrosis decreases AAV genome content in hepatocytes while increasing it in non-parenchymal liver cells and splenic immune cells. Importantly, the capsid variant AAV-KP1 retains transduction efficiency in fibrotic livers, highlighting its potential for expanding gene therapy applications to fibrotic diseases.",,,,© 2025.

40064754,Chronic Hand Eczema (CHE): A Narrative Review.,"Atopic dermatitis, Chronic hand eczema, Hand dermatitis, Therapeutics",Dermatology and therapy,"Chronic hand eczema (CHE) is a common and challenging skin condition, characterized by persistent hand dermatitis which lasts over 3 months or recurs at least twice a year. This condition is often multifactorial, involving genetic predispositions, environmental factors and triggers, such as irritants and allergens. Studies show a higher incidence in women, though prevalence estimates vary across different age groups. The pathogenesis involves complex immune mechanisms, particularly Th1/Th2 cell responses. Clinically, CHE presents in various forms, with symptoms such as redness, scaling and itching that significantly impact patients' quality of life. Treatment approaches are diverse. While emollients and topical corticosteroids have historically been the mainstay, new systemic therapies like JAK inhibitors and biologics are progressively being used for severe cases. Key molecular targets comprise interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, the JAK-STAT pathway, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) and chemoattractant chemokines. Managing CHE effectively remains a challenge because of its chronicity and the variability in individual responses to treatment. However, emerging therapeutic strategies will help clinicians to offer more patient-centred approaches.",,,,© 2025. The Author(s).,"10.1007/s13555-025-01365-7

40064752,Cytokines and chemokines modulate the growth of pituitary adenoma/neuroendocrine tumors: preliminary results of a monocenter prospective pilot study.,"Acromegaly, Immune cells, Lymphocytes, Macrophages, Microenvironment, PitNET, Pituitary adenoma",Pituitary,"Cytokine and chemokines have been recognized to be involved in the progression and prognosis of pituitary adenoma/neuroendocrine tumors (PAs/PitNETs), also known as pituitary adenomas. We aim to investigate the expression of cytokine and chemokine in PAs/PitNETs, and their association with PAs/PitNETs clinical and biological behavior.
A prospective and monocenter study was performed on 16 patients diagnosed for PAs/PitNETs. Cytokine and chemokine were detected on freshly collected PAs/PitNETs samples. Tumor infiltering immune cells were investigated on formally fixed and paraffin-embedded PAs/PitNETs samples. Clinical, biochemical, molecular and morphological data were collected from patients' medical records.
Out of 72 patients with PAs/PitNETs that underwent surgical removal at the Neurosurgery Division of our Institution between January and June 2023, sixteen patients were enrolled in the study. Out of 42 cytokines and chemokines that we investigated, we found that the expressions of the growth-regulated oncogene (GRO)/CXCL1, thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were higher in invasive tumors than in not-invasive ones (respectively p = 0.01, p = 0.002 and p = 0.002). The EGF expression was higher in tumors with a MIB1 > 3% than in those with MIB1 < 3% (p = 0.014). A positive correlation was detected between the expressions of EGF and CXCL1 (p = 0.003, r: 0.7), EGF and GRO-a (p = 0.01, r:0.61), and the number of tumors infiltering CD68 + macrophages and the expression of CCL2 (p = 0.008, r = 0.695).
Our preliminary results support that in PAs/PitNETs, the cytokines and chemokines generate an immune network, that may contribute to regulating the cell proliferation and pattern of growth.",,,"Our preliminary results support that in PAs/PitNETs, the cytokines and chemokines generate an immune network, that may contribute to regulating the cell proliferation and pattern of growth.",© 2025.

40064728,Effect of photobiomodulation on monocyte dynamics and cytokine levels following plyometric exercise in physically active men.,"Inflammation, Monocytes, Muscle damage, Photobiomodulation, Plyometric exercise",Lasers in medical science,"Photobiomodulation (PBMT) has been investigated as a non-invasive approach to modulate inflammation and muscle recovery, especially after intense exercise. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of PBMT on the dynamics of monocyte subpopulations and cytokine levels after a plyometric exercise session in physically active men aged 18-25 years. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 22 participants were divided into PBMT and placebo groups. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and 72 h post-exercise. Monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry, while cytokine levels (TNF-α and MCP-1) were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorvent assays (ELISA). Plyometric exercise increases classic monocytes (CD14 + CD16-) at 72 h compared in the PBMT group (+ 2,38% p = 0.035). Intermediate monocytes (CD14 + CD16 +), increase immediately after (p < 0.001) and 72 h (PTBM + 21,43%; placebo + 36%; p = 0.023) after exercise in the both group; Non-classical monocytes (CD14-CD16 +) showed differences between groups at 72 h (11,11%; p = 0.002). Exercise increased TNF-α and MCP-1 levels immediately after (p < 0.01 for both groups). PBMT reduced TNF-α levels below baseline at 72 h (-12,50%; p = 0.035), while MCP-1 remained elevated in the placebo group (+ 27,78%; p < 0.035). Differences in MCP-1 changes (Δ%) were observed 72 h post-exercise (p = 0.03). These findings suggest that PBMT attenuates inflammation and promotes immune recovery after exercise.",,,,"© 2025.

A brigimadlin exposure-tumour growth inhibition (E-TGI) model was developed to support the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) selection of brigimadlin in future clinical trials.
Population modelling was applied to analyse longitudinal tumour size (sum of longest diameters, SLD) data of 151 patients from a phase I trial treated with 5-80 mg brigimadlin every third or fourth week (q3w/q4w). The impact of brigimadlin exposure on tumour shrinkage was assessed and the effects of patient- and tumour-related covariates on model parameters were explored. The final E-TGI model was used to simulate the effect of brigimadlin treatment on longitudinal SLD. The probability of dropout from tumour assessments were characterized via logistic regression and included in simulations to allow for realistic predictions of tumour shrinkage over time.
The E-TGI model adequately characterized the observed SLD data over time. Simulations demonstrated a substantially stronger tumour shrinkage with higher dose, based on the identified exposure-response relationship. For patients with the most common tumour (dedifferentiated liposarcoma) and standard body weight (70 kg) and remaining in the study for 1 year, the median relative change from baseline in tumour size was 0.141%, -4.48%, -10.8% and -17.4%, for treatment with 20, 30, 45 and 60 mg brigimadlin q3w doses, respectively.
The developed E-TGI model predicted that higher doses of brigimadlin resulted in a substantially stronger tumour shrinkage. These results contributed to selecting 45 mg brigimadlin q3w dose as RP2D in subsequent clinical trials.",,"The E-TGI model adequately characterized the observed SLD data over time.

This study aimed to provide guidance on metrics in harm profile reporting and evaluating current practices in clinical trials against the CONSORT Harms 2022 recommendations.
We have summarized characteristics of four reporting metrics-cumulative incidence rate, cumulative event rate, exposure-adjusted incidence rate, and exposure-adjusted event rate. To evaluate the current reporting patterns, we conducted a meta-epidemiological study of 116 clinical trials published in four top-tier medical journals from September 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.
The cumulative incidence rate was the most frequently used metric (81.03%), followed by a simple count (16.38%), exposure-adjusted event rate (3.45%), exposure-adjusted incidence rate (2.59%), and cumulative event rate (0.86%). 105 trials (91.38%) employed a single measure and 10 trials (8.62%) incorporated two different measures. Only 14 trials (12.07%) gave explicit evidence for the reporting of recurrent adverse events and 6 trials (5.17%) explicitly stated their rationale for not considering recurrence. Adjustments for exposure duration were notably absent in trials with unequal drop-out rates and exposure times.

40064371,Study protocol for a duration-randomized clinical trial to determine the optimal length of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with a 5-drug regimen: The DRAMATIC trial.,"Bedaquiline, Clinical trial, Clofazimine, Delamanid, Duration randomization, Levofloxacin, Linezolid, Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis",Contemporary clinical trials,"Current guidelines for the treatment of multidrug-resistant/rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) are based on clinical trials evaluating fixed duration regimens. However, when a regimen succeeds, it remains unknown whether a shorter duration could yield the same results. Similarly, if a regimen fails, it is unclear whether extending the treatment could improve outcomes. Trials are needed to assess the relationship between various treatment durations and outcomes.
We designed a duration-randomized trial of treatment for fluoroquinolone-susceptible MDR/RR-TB. The DRAMATIC (Duration Randomized Anti-MDR-TB And Tailored Intervention Clinical) Trial is a multicenter, randomized, partially blinded, four-arm, phase 2 trial that examines an all oral, pyrazinamide-free regimen of bedaquiline, clofazimine, delamanid, linezolid, and levofloxacin, with administration of linezolid only in the initial 16 weeks of treatment. The four trial arms are treatment durations of 16, 24, 32 and 40 weeks. Randomization is stratified by ""extensive"" or ""non-extensive"" disease based on baseline smear (or Xpert) and cavitary status. The primary endpoint is relapse-free survival at week 76. The target sample size is 220. Participants are being enrolled in sites in the Philippines and Vietnam. The expected output will be an equation describing the relationship between treatment duration and the proportion of participants with relapse-free survival.

Olezarsen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the mRNA for apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), a protein known to impair TG clearance by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase and the hepatic uptake of triglycerides and triglyceride-rich remnants. Olezarsen has been evaluated in patients with predominantly moderate HTG (150-499 mg/dl) and a rare genetic condition known as Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS), with TG lowering effects of 53% and 44%, respectively, and reductions in pancreatitis among the FCS population. However, no dedicated trial has tested olezarsen in patients with severe HTG. In these two pivotal phase 3 trials, CORE -TIMI 72a (NCT05079919) and CORE2 -TIMI 72b (NCT05552326), over 1,000 patients with severe HTG will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either olezarsen (80 mg or 50 mg dose) or matching placebo. Patients will be treated for a total of 53 weeks and evaluated for the primary endpoint of percent change in TGs from baseline to 6 months compared to placebo. Pooled analyses of CORE and CORE2 will also assess olezarsen's effect on acute pancreatitis events and change in hepatic steatosis. Together, CORE -TIMI 72a (NCT05079919) and CORE2 -TIMI 72b (NCT05552326) are designed to establish the efficacy and safety of olezarsen in patients with severe HTG.",,,,Copyright © 2025.

Rheumatology,"The role of classification criteria is particularly important in rheumatic diseases compared with other medical disorders, as the complexity and overlapping symptoms of these conditions make diagnosis challenging. Moreover, the absence of established diagnostic criteria further complicates diagnosing patients. Classification criteria can assist health-care professionals and patients as a diagnostic aid. However, classification criteria are developed for research purposes to standardise populations in clinical trials and observational studies of rheumatic diseases and not for diagnosing patients. Introduction of the 2023 American College of Rheumatology-European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (ACR-EULAR) antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria underscores the important distinction between meeting these criteria and being diagnosed with the condition-a differentiation essential in both clinical practice and research. Although the 2023 ACR-EULAR antiphospholipid syndrome classification criteria improved precision in classification of pregnant individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome, which ultimately should lead to better outcomes and care for these patients, the updated criteria should not be used as diagnostic criteria in routine clinical practice.

Dysentery, a severe form of AD characterized by blood and mucus in the stool, raises controversies regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics. The objective of this manuscript is to synthesize the available information on the indications, risks, and benefits of antibiotics used in infectious dysentery during early childhood. A scoping systematic review was conducted using international reference documents and the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Studies from 2014 onwards that addressed antibiotic management in children under 5 years old with bacterial or parasitic dysentery were included. Among the 39 selected studies, the evidence shows limited benefits and significant risks associated with antibiotic use, with recommendations varying based on specific etiology and the patient's clinical conditions, where it is evident that the rational use of antibiotics in pediatric dysentery is crucial to avoid bacterial resistance and adverse effects. There is a need for future research to establish guidelines based on robust clinical trials, to optimize targeted treatment and improve clinical outcomes in this population.

40064006,Acupuncture with Moxibustion at Conception Vessel 17 on Pulmonary Functions in Patients with Asthma: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study.,,Advances in mind-body medicine,"Acupuncture and moxibustion are used worldwide for treating various diseases including asthma. Conception Vessel 17 (CV-17) is the influential point for the respiratory tissues. It is commonly used in the management of asthma. However, there are no known studies that report the effect of needling with moxibustion at CV-17 alone in asthma patients. Thus, this study aimed to examine the effect of acupuncture and moxibustion at CV-17 on pulmonary functions in asthma patients.
In this randomized placebo-controlled study, a total of sixty participants with asthma were recruited from a medical college and hospital located in Chennai, India. All the recruited participants were randomly assigned to either the acupuncture with moxibustion group (AMG) or placebo control group (PCG). AMG received needling with moxibustion at the CV-17 acupuncture point, while PCG received needling with moxibustion at a non-acupuncture point for 20 minutes once a day, daily for 2 weeks.
Within-group analysis showed a significant increase in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in 1s (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75%, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in AMG, whereas PCG showed a significant increase in only FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and FEF25-75%. Furthermore, the increase in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and PEFR were greater in AMG than PCG. None of the participants reported any serious adverse effects during the study period.

T2DM reduces cerebral blood flow and increases vascular resistance as the duration of the disease increases. Yoga, a holistic method of healing is known to influence cerebral haemodynamics.
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an integrated approach of yoga therapy on cerebral haemodynamics in T2DM patients.
Participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into yoga and control groups. The yoga group underwent 14 days of intensive diabetes-specific yoga intervention along with their standard medications, whereas the control group continued with their standard medications alone. A Transcranial Doppler instrument was used to assess the Peak systolic velocity, mean blood flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, pulsatility index, and resistance index of the middle cerebral artery on days 1 and 14.
20 participants (15 male and 5 female) completed the study among which 10 participants were in the yoga group (mean age: 51.0 ± 5.6 years) and the other 10 participants in the control group (mean age: 50.6 ± 4.0 years). With 14 days of yoga intervention in T2DM, both within- and between-subjects effects on cerebral haemodynamic parameters were non-significant. However, an increasing trend in the mean blood flow velocity (P = .07) and a reduction in the resistance index (P = .89) of the middle cerebral artery in the yoga group were noted.

40064004,Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises for People with Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,,Advances in mind-body medicine,"Some studies suggests that mind-body therapies may be helpful for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) for symptom management. PwMS have reported benefits from Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises (TRE); however, only limited research exists on the potential benefits of TRE.
The study intended to determine whether an eight-week intervention of Tension and Trauma Releasing Exercises (TRE), a mind-body therapy, could primarily reduce fatigue and secondarily decrease other MS-related symptoms and to explore new, experimental outcome measures-sleep, hand motor function, gait function, cognitive function, or mood-for use in future research on TRE for PwMS.
The research team performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
The study took place at the Danish MS Society in Valby, Denmark.
Participants were 28 members of the society who had an MS diagnosis and lived in the Copenhagen area.
The research team performed simple randomization to allocate participants to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received eight sessions of TRE and performed TRE daily at home, while the control group continued their usual care only.
The primary outcome measure was self-reported fatigue measured via the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) at baseline and postintervention. Daily self-reported levels of nine MS-related symptoms as well as stress levels were obtained as secondary endpoints, using a digital tool, the MS PRO. For explorative purposes, daily measures of sleep duration and quality were obtained, via the Fitbit Charge 3 activity tracker. Finally, smartphone-based measurements of hand motor function, gait, cognition, and mood were obtained via the Floodlight Open (FLO) app.
On primary outcomes, no significant differences between the TRE intervention group and the control group were detected at follow-up in the unadjusted analyses. However, when adjusted for imbalance in covariates, significant group differences were obtained in the MFIS total score (P = .03) as well as marginal significance in the MFISphys score (P = .06). The TRE intervention significantly reduced reported levels of spasticity and pain across the whole intervention period, and it showed a significant effect of gradual improvement in the 5 U-turn test over the study period.
Positive effects on both primary and secondary outcomes from the TRE intervention were seen when adjusting for covariate imbalance. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that TRE significantly improves fatigue in people with MS. Furthermore, the current study underlines the potential effect of bias-adjustment, when covariate imbalance is present. However, further research is needed to confirm the positive effects.",,"On primary outcomes, no significant differences between the TRE intervention group and the control group were detected at follow-up in the unadjusted analyses.

Recent additions to the armamentarium of anti-heart failure therapies include angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Both classes have demonstrated mortality and morbidity benefits. Although these new therapies have morbidity and mortality benefits, it is not known whether rapid initiation is beneficial when compared with the conventional, slower-stepped approach. Many clinicians have been taught that starting with low-dose therapies and gradually increasing the dose is a safe way of intensifying treatment regimens. Pharmacologically, it is rational to use a combination of drugs that target multiple pathological mechanisms, as there is potential synergism and better therapeutic outcomes. Theoretically, the quicker the right combinations are used, the more likely the beneficial effects will be experienced. However, rapid up-titration must be balanced with patient safety and tolerability.
This study aims to determine if early addition of ARNIs, SGLT2is, β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (within 4 weeks), when compared with the same therapies initiated slower (within 6 months), will reduce all-cause mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with stable heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
This is a single-center, randomized controlled, double-arm, assessor-blinded, active control, and pragmatic clinical trial. Adults with stable heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy will be randomized to conventional sequencing (the control arm; over 6 months) of anti-heart failure therapies, and a second arm will receive rapid sequencing (over 4 weeks). Study participants will be followed for 5 years to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the 2 types of sequencing. Posttrial access and care will be provided to all study participants throughout their lifespan.
We are currently in the process of obtaining ethical clearance and funding.
We envisage that this study will help support evidence-based medicine and inform clinical practice guidelines on the optimal rate of sequencing of anti-heart failure therapies. A third placebo arm was considered, but costs would be too much and not providing study participants with therapies with known morbidity and mortality benefits may be unethical, in our opinion. Given the post-COVID-19 economic downturn and posttrial access to interventions, a major challenge will be acquiring funding for this study.

40063942,Effects of a Mobile Health Intervention Based on Behavioral Integrated Model on Cognitive and Behavioral Changes in Gestational Weight Management: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"cognition, health behavior, information-motivation-behavioral skills model, mobile health, mobile phone, pregnant woman, psychological models, randomized controlled trial",Journal of medical Internet research,"The key to gestational weight management intervention involves health-related behaviors, including dietary and exercise management. Behavioral theory-based interventions are effective in improving health-related behaviors. However, evidence for mobile health interventions based on specific behavioral theories is insufficient and their effects have not been fully elucidated.
This study aimed to examine the effects of a gestational mobile health intervention on psychological cognition and behavior for gestational weight management, using an integrated behavioral model as the theoretical framework.
This study was conducted in a tertiary maternity hospital and conducted as a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. Using the behavioral model, integrated with the protection motivation theory and information-motivation-behavioral skills model (PMT-IMB model), the intervention group received a mobile health intervention using a self-developed app from 14 to 37 gestational weeks, whereas the control group received routine guidance through the application. Psychological cognition and behaviors related to weight management during pregnancy were the main outcomes, which were measured at baseline, and at the second and third trimesters of pregnancy using a self-designed questionnaire. Generalized estimation and regression equations were used to compare the outcome differences between the intervention and control groups.
In total, 302 (302/360, 83.9%) participants underwent all measurements at 3 time points (intervention group: n=150; control group: n=152). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had significantly higher scores for information, perceived vulnerability, response cost, and exercise management in the second trimester, while their scores for perceived vulnerability, response cost, and diet management were significantly higher in the third trimester. The results of repeated measures analysis revealed that, in psychological cognition, the information dimension exhibited both the time effects (T3 β=3.235, 95% CI 2.859-3.611; P<.001) and the group effects (β=0.597, 95% CI 0.035-1.158; P=.04). Similarly, response costs demonstrated both the time effects (T3 β=0.745, 95% CI 0.199-1.291; P=.008) and the group effects (β=1.034, 95% CI 0.367-1.700; P=.002).

40063933,Intelligent Robot Interventions for People With Dementia: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"agitation, anxiety, artificial intelligence, dementia, intelligent robot, meta-analysis",Journal of medical Internet research,"The application of intelligent robots in therapy is becoming more and more important for people with dementia. More extensive research is still needed to evaluate its impact on behavioral and psychological dementia symptoms, as well as quality of life in different care settings.
The purpose of this research is to methodically assess how well intelligence robot interventions work for patients with dementia.
In accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from the time of their founding to February 2024, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials on the use of intelligent robots in people with dementia. Two authors (WF and RZ) independently applied the Cochrane Collaboration bias assessment tool to assess the included studies' quality. The intervention effect of intelligent robots on patients with dementia was summarized using a fixed-effect model or a random-effects model with Stata software (version 16.0; StataCorp). Subgroup analysis was performed according to the intelligent robot type and the intervention duration. Publication bias was tested using funnel plots, Egger tests, and the trim-and-fill method.
In total, 15 studies were finally included for systematic review, encompassing 705 participants, of which 12 studies were subjected to meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found that compared with the control group, intelligent robot intervention significantly reduced the levels of agitation (standardized mean difference -0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17; P<.001) and anxiety (weighted mean difference -1.93, 95% CI -3.13 to -0.72; P=.002) in patients with dementia. However, the intervention of intelligent robots had no significant effect on the following (all P>.05): cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depression, quality of life, step count during the day, and the hours of lying down during the night of patients with dementia. Subgroup analysis revealed that the improvement of depression was related to the duration of the intervention (≤12 vs 12 weeks: 0.08, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.37 vs -0.68, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.37; P=.26) and was independent of the type of intelligent robots (animal robots vs humanoid robots: -0.30, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.15 vs 0.07, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.34; P=.26).
This study shows that intelligent robot intervention can help improve the agitation and anxiety levels of people with dementia. The intervention may be more effective the longer it is implemented. The appearance of the intelligent robot has no effect on the intervention effect. Further research is needed to help collect physiological data, such as physical activity in people with dementia; explore the impact of other intelligent robot design features on the intervention effect; and provide a reference for improving intelligent robots and intervention programs.

40063887,Clinical validation of a novel hand dexterity measurement device.,,PLOS digital health,"The lack of sensitive objective outcome measures for hand dexterity is a barrier for clinical assessment of neurological conditions and has negatively affected clinical trials. Here, we clinically validate a new method for measuring hand dexterity, a novel hand worn sensor that digitises the Finger Tapping Test. The device was assessed in a cohort of 180 healthy controls and 51 people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and compared against rating scales and traditional measures (Nine Hole Peg test and grip dynamometry). 14 features were extracted from the device and using a logistic regression algorithm, a 0-100 dexterity performance score was generated for each participant, which accounted for age/sex differences. The device returned objective ratings of a participant's hand dexterity (dominant, non-dominant and overall score). The average overall dexterity performance score in all healthy participants was 88 ± 17 (mean ± standard deviation). The overall dexterity score was statistically significantly worse in participants with ALS (age/sex matched healthy subset: 80 ± 20, ALS: 45 ± 32, p-value < 0.0001). The device also had a higher completion rate, (94% dominant hand) compared to the traditional measures (82% dominant hand). This test and scoring system have been validated and the regression model was developed using a framework that is potentially applicable to any relevant condition. This device could act as an objective outcome measure in clinical trials and may be useful in improving patient care.",,,,"Copyright: © 2025 Hayden et al.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov covering the period from database inception to May 3rd, 2023. Double-blind RCTs and cohort studies reporting biologic therapies' effects on LVV including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) with outcomes of interest in English were included. The primary outcome of interest was relapse rates during glucocorticoid tapering. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0 and the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool were used for the quality assessment. Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis.
Of the 4599 references retrieved, 10 RCTs regarding GCA, 6 cohort studies, and 2 RCTs regarding TAK were included, comprising 997 participants in total. All the included RCTs were of low risk of bias, while the 6 cohort studies were of moderate to serious risk of bias. Meta-analysis suggested a significant superiority of biologic agents in prolonging relapse-free survival, increasing glucocorticoid taper rate, and decreasing cumulative glucocorticoids dose for both GCA and TAK. Additionally, GCA patients using biologic agents had significantly lower relapse rates and ESR levels with higher remission rates. Trends of favoring biologic agents in reducing relapse rate, ITAS-2010, ITAS-A, ESR, and CRP along with increased remission rate for TAK were also observed.

40063867,"Impact of mass drug administration with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis on hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis infections in Papua New Guinea.",,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Persons with lymphatic filariasis (LF) are often co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths. A single co-administered dose of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) is recommended by WHO for mass drug administration (MDA) for LF instead of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We compared the effectiveness of a single round of MDA with IDA or DA on hookworm and strongyloidiasis in PNG.
This study was conducted as part of a cluster randomized trial of MDA with IDA versus DA for LF in individuals willing to provide stool and blood samples at baseline and 12 months after MDA. Participants from 23 villages were included in the clinical trial. Primary outcomes were changes in hookworm prevalence and infection intensity assessed by Kato Katz and Strongyloides prevalence by serology. Hookworm prevalence at baseline was 78% (91/117) and 80% (119/149) in villages assigned to DA and IDA treatment, respectively. Twelve months post-MDA, hookworm prevalence decreased to 56.5% in DA- and 34.4% in IDA-treated villages, respectively (p<0.001, both comparisons). The proportion of individuals with moderate to heavy infection (>2000 egg per gram (EPG)) similarly decreased from 8.7% to 1.5% after DA (p = 0.001) and from 5.7% to 1.0% after IDA (p = 0.002). Using a logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, baseline hookworm prevalence, and village drug coverage, IDA resulted in a 45% greater reduction in hookworm prevalence than DA (Odds ratio 0.55, 95% CI [0.31,0.99], p = 0.049). MDA also reduced hookworm transmission. Strongyloides seroprevalence at baseline was 68% (192/283) and 62% (180/290) in IDA and DA villages, respectively, with 49% becoming seronegative in the IDA versus 23% in DA villages at 12 months (p = 0.0001).
MDA with IDA was more effective than DA for reducing hookworm and Strongyloides infections in PNG, extending the benefit of MDA with IDA beyond its effect on LF.",,,,"Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

40063856,Association of Plasma Biomarkers With Longitudinal Atrophy and Microvascular Burden on MRI Across Neurodegenerative and Cerebrovascular Diseases.,,Neurology,"Plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD), neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are increasingly being used in clinical trials for diagnosis and monitoring of dementia. However, their association with longitudinal structural brain MRI changes, an important outcome measure across neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases, is less known. We investigated how baseline plasma biomarkers reflect MRI markers of progression over time in patients with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.
This longitudinal cohort study included patients from the Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment (AD/MCI), Parkinson disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders (FTD), or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), followed annually for 2 years. Recruitment took place at specialized university-based dementia, movement disorders, and/or stroke clinics in the province of ON, Canada. MRI outcomes included markers of cerebral atrophy (ventricular CSF and regional gray matter volumes) and of small vessel disease pathology (white matter hyperintensity [WMH], perivascular spaces, and lacunar volumes). Hemorrhagic markers at baseline were also included. Plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), phosphorylated tau181 and tau217 (p-tau181, p-tau217), and β-amyloid (Aβ
We analyzed 1,240 MRIs from 473 patients (age: 69.2 ± 7.4 [range: 49-87]; 32.8% women). Elevated baseline levels of GFAP, NfL, p-tau181, and p-tau217, and to a lesser extent decreased levels of Aβ

However, the comparative efficacy of helmet NIRS versus other strategies in this context remains elusive.
A network meta-analysis was conducted to compare the efficacy of various NIRS strategies in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Strategies assessed included high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), helmet bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and standard oxygen therapy (SOT). Relevant RCTs were identified via PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Outcomes of interest included intubation rate, mortality rate, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and length of hospital stay.
Five RCTs published between 2021 and 2022 were included. Helmet BiPAP was associated with a significantly lower intubation risk compared with HFNO (relative risk (RR): 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.86) and SOT (RR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.62). Additionally, helmet BiPAP was linked to shorter ICU stay compared with SOT (RR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02-0.67). However, no significant differences were identified in mortality or hospital stay length between SOT, HFNO, CPAP, and helmet BiPAP groups.

40063693,Effects of Vitamin Administration on Orthodontic Tooth Movement: A Scoping Review.,"orthodontic appliances, orthodontics, tooth movement, vitamins",Nutrition reviews,"Orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) is possible by bone remodeling that takes place during orthodontic therapy. The rate at which teeth move is determined by a variety of factors that can impact bone remodeling. Vitamins are well-known antioxidants that influence bone turnover.
This scoping review was designed to appraise the effects of the local and systemic administration of vitamins C, D, and E principally on fixed orthodontic treatment, retention, and relapse.
A scoping review protocol was applied following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Guidelines for Scoping Reviews. A detailed search strategy, including main keywords and synonyms, was applied in the following electronic databases: PubMed (via MEDLINE), Embase (via Ovid), Cochrane Library, and Web of Sciences, for articles published in English in the past 10 years.
The database online search identified 70 potential articles. After removing duplicates, 39 full-text articles were independently evaluated. Eighteen studies were discarded. The remaining 21 studies were finally included. Of these selected studies, 8 were conducted on animals, 9 were conducted with human participants, 1 was an in vitro study, and 3 were systematic reviews. One systematic review and meta-analysis was also included.
Based on a variety of animal and human investigations, the findings of this scoping review imply that vitamins C, D, and E accelerate OTM by facilitating the bone remodeling process. However, more powerful randomized clinical trials are still required to reinforce the knowledge of vitamins' influence on orthodontic therapy.

40063657,Effectiveness of rehabilitation training on radiotherapy-related abnormalities of voice function in head and neck cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,,PloS one,"Abnormal speech function caused by radiotherapy will affect the normal communication of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and even interrupt their social life. Rehabilitation Training is widely used to improve articulatory abnormalities in patients with HNC. However, the effectiveness of these rehabilitation measures in restoring the voice function of HNC patients is still unknown.
This study aimed to systematically examine the effects of rehabilitation training on radiotherapy-related voice function and quality of life in patients with HNC.
The databases PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, CNKI, Wan Fang, and SinoMed were searched for studies published from inception through October 2024. Randomized controlled trials of rehabilitation training to improve voice function abnormalities associated with radiotherapy for HNC were included, and two investigators independently performed the literature review. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software to determine statistical heterogeneity based on P-values and I2 values.
13 randomized controlled trials involving 710 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that rehabilitation training significantly affected the patients' maximum phonation time(MD=1.53, 95%CI=[0.83, 2.23], P<0.0001, Grade Moderate), smoothed cepstral peak prominence(MD=-0.59, 95%CI=[-0.89, -0.29], P=0.0001, Grade Moderate), social communication abilities(MD=-2.60, 95%CI=[-5.14, -0.07], P=0.04, Grade Moderate), and quality of life(MD=8.49, 95%CI=[3.06, 13.92], P=0.002, Grade Moderate).
Rehabilitation training is an effective approach for ameliorating abnormal voice functions after radiotherapy for HNC. However, there is no consensus on the optimal frequency, periodicity, and follow-up of interventions for rehabilitation training. More studies are still required to determine the optimal intervention effect for ameliorating speech function abnormalities in patients with HNC after radiotherapy.",,"13 randomized controlled trials involving 710 participants were included.

40063640,Comparative effectiveness of different surgical timings on neurological outcomes for cranioplasty: Protocol for a prospective non-randomized controlled trial.,,PloS one,"Cranioplasty (CP), a surgical procedure that restores cranial integrity and potentially enhances neurological outcomes, is commonly performed following decompressive craniectomy for various reasons. However, there is considerable controversy and variation regarding the optimal timing for cranioplasty, particularly concerning its impact on neurological functional outcomes. This paper outlines the protocol for a multicenter, non-randomized controlled trial designed to investigate whether the timing of cranioplasty influences neurological outcomes.
This study will be conducted from June 2025 to June 2026 across multiple clinical centers in China, targeting the enrollment of at least 500 adults aged 18-65 years with skull defects larger than 25 cm². Participants will be divided based on the timing of their cranioplasty relative to decompressive craniectomy into two groups: early (within 3 months post-decompression) and late (after 3 months). The primary outcome, assessed through the Barthel Index, will measure functional recovery 6 months post-surgery, with secondary outcomes including mortality, quality of life, cognitive performance and complication rates.
This non-randomized clinical trial focuses on the neurological outcomes associated with different timings of cranioplasty. It is anticipated that the findings will contribute valuable insights and support more informed clinical decisions regarding the timing of cranioplasty. By comparing early and late cranioplasty, the trial aims to clarify how timing affects recovery and overall neurological improvement post-surgery.

A systematic search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted. Fifty-nine studies on the relationship between vitamins and RLS were included, as well as four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on vitamin treatment of RLS. Compared with non-RLS patients, serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower both in primary (P =  0.009) and secondary (P =  0.003) RLS patients, and appeared to be positively correlated with disease severity. Serum folate levels were lower in pregnant RLS patients than in pregnant non-RLS patients (P =  0.007), but this phenomenon was not seen in non-pregnant RLS patients (P =  0.65). Vitamin B12 (P =  0.59) and B1 (P =  0.362) deficiencies were not found in RLS patients. Oral vitamin B6 significantly improved primary RLS (P < 0.0001), while vitamin D did not (P =  0.05). Oral vitamin C (P < 0.00001), E (P < 0.0001), and vitamin C +  E (P < 0.00001) all significantly improved hemodialysis-associated RLS with equal efficacy. Vitamin C is equivalent to 0.18 mg of pramipexole for the treatment of RLS (P =  0.81). In this meta-analysis, low vitamin D levels were found in patients with RLS, low folate levels were associated with RLS only in pregnant women, and vitamin C/E/B6 may improved symptoms in patients with RLS. These results suggest that vitamin deficiency or insufficiency may be related to the pathogenesis of RLS.",,,,"Copyright: © 2025 Xu et al.

We conducted a prospective, single-arm exploratory study. Patients with non-dialysis CKD stage G4-5 (estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who did not achieve their BP goals with angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) administration, were enrolled and switched to sacubitril/valsartan.

40063405,"Combining covariate adjustment with group sequential, information-adaptive designs to improve randomized trial efficiency.","TMLE, causal inference, independent increments, standardization",Biometrics,"Group sequential designs (GSDs), which involve preplanned interim analyses that allow for early stopping for efficacy or futility, are commonly used for ethical and efficiency reasons. Covariate adjustment, which involves appropriately adjusting for prespecified prognostic baseline variables, can improve precision and is generally recommended by regulators. Combining these, that is, using adjusted estimators at interim and final analyses of a GSD, has potential for dual benefits. We address 2 challenges involved in combining these methods. First, adjusted estimators may lack the independent increments structure (asymptotically) that is required to directly apply standard stopping boundaries for GSDs. We address this by applying a linear transformation to the sequence of adjusted estimators across analysis times, resulting in a new sequence of consistent, asymptotically normal estimators with the independent increments property that either improves or leaves precision unchanged. This approach generalizes foundational results on GSDs with semiparametric efficient estimators to any sequence of regular, asymptotically linear estimators. Second, we address the practical problem of handling uncertainty about how much (if any) precision gain will result from covariate adjustment. This is important for trial planning, since an incorrect projection of a covariate's prognostic value risks an over- or underpowered trial. We propose using information-adaptive designs, that is, continuing the trial until the required information level is achieved. This design enables faster, more efficient trials, without sacrificing validity or power.",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.

The development of HAPH involves various factors such as pressure changes, inflammation, oxidative stress, gene regulation, and signal transduction. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this condition operate at molecular, cellular, and genetic levels. Diagnosis of HAPH often relies on echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and other methods to assess pulmonary artery pressure and its impact on cardiac function. Treatment options for HAPH encompass both nondrug and drug therapies. While advancements have been made in understanding the pathological mechanisms through research on animal models and clinical trials, there are still limitations to be addressed. Future research should focus on exploring molecular targets, personalized medicine, long-term management strategies, and interdisciplinary approaches. By leveraging advanced technologies like systems biology, omics technology, big data, and artificial intelligence, a comprehensive analysis of HAPH pathogenesis can lead to the identification of new treatment targets and strategies, ultimately enhancing patient quality of life and prognosis.

These results highlight the potential of HT in improving long-term functional and psychopathological outcomes in youth mental health. HT may be an equally effective and even more sustainable type of treatment for child and adolescent mental disorders. The trial was preregistered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00025424, 05/27/2021).",,,,© 2025. The Author(s).,"10.1007/s00787-025-02677-x

40063259,A multimodal approach to depression diagnosis: insights from machine learning algorithm development in primary care.,"Data-driven methods, Depression diagnosis, Depression subtypes, Predictive algorithm, Primary care",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,"General practitioners play an essential role in identifying depression and are often the first point of contact for patients. Current diagnostic tools, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, provide initial screening but might lead to false positives. To address this, we developed a two-step machine learning model called Clinical 15, trained on a cohort of 581 participants using a nested cross-validation framework. The model integrates self-reported data from validated questionnaires within a study sample of patients presenting to general practitioners. Clinical 15 demonstrated a balanced accuracy of 88.2% and incorporates a traffic light system: green for healthy, red for depression, and yellow for uncertain cases. Gaussian mixture model clustering identified four depression subtypes, including an Immuno-Metabolic cluster characterized by obesity, low-grade inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and reduced physical activity. The Clinical 15 algorithm identified all patients within the immuno-metabolic cluster as depressed, although 22.2% (30.8% across the whole dataset) were categorized as uncertain, leading to a yellow traffic light. The biological characterization of patients and monitoring of their clinical course may be used for differential risk stratification in the future. In conclusion, the Clinical 15 model provides a highly sensitive and specific tool to support GPs in diagnosing depression. Future algorithm improvements may integrate further biological markers and longitudinal data. The tool's clinical utility needs further evaluation through a randomized controlled trial, which is currently being planned. Additionally, assessing whether GPs actively integrate the algorithm's predictions into their diagnostic and treatment decisions will be critical for its practical adoption.",,,,© 2025.

40063246,Bone substitute in distal radius osteotomy: a prospective randomized double-blinded study on micromotion and outcomes in 42 patients up to one year.,"Bone substitutes, Malunion, Osteotomy, Radiostereometric analysis, Radius fractures, Wrist fractures",Archives of orthopaedic and trauma surgery,"Symptomatic malunion following a distal radius fracture (DRF) is commonly treated with a corrective osteotomy. Such osteotomy is traditionally fixed with a palmar plate in combination with autogenous bone graft in the osteotomy gap. However, bone grafting prolongs surgery and may result in comorbidity. Recent studies suggest that filling the osteotomy gap may not be necessary. An alternative is to fill the gap with an injectable bone substitute (IBS). However, there is limited data on inter-fragmentary micromotion in osteotomies utilizing IBS. This study aims to assess micromotion and outcomes in patients undergoing corrective osteotomy for malunited DRFs, comparing outcomes between those treated with and without IBS.
Patients undergoing distal radius osteotomy for symptomatic malunion were randomized to either an IBS (hydroxyapatite, HA) group or control group (where the osteotomy gap was left unfilled) in combination with palmar plate fixation. Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) markers were placed in the radius, and RSA assessments were conducted immediately postoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome of the study was dorsal/palmar tilt, while the secondary outcomes were radial shortening, radial inclination, radial shift, as well as clinical and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROMs).
42 patients (24 control, 18 HA-group) were included in the analysis. Significantly less micromotions were noted in the HA-group at multiple follow-ups (p ≤ 0.05) in X-axis rotation and Y-axis translation, however they were in the subclinical scale. Both groups showed functional improvements over time, but there were no differences between the groups in clinical outcomes or PROMs.

40063193,Comparison of the effect of teaching coping skills and acupressure on premenstrual stress: a randomized controlled trial.,"Acupressure, Coping skills, Non-pharmacological interventions, Premenstrual syndrome",Discover mental health,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to significant clinical physical and psychological manifestations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, leading to significant distress and impaired functional capacity. Given the side effects caused by pharmacotherapy, it seems logical to use non-pharmacological methods that can reduce symptoms such as menstrual stress. Thus, this study has been conducted to compare the effect of teaching coping skills and acupressure on premenstrual stress in undergraduate students of the Medical School of Azad University of Sanandaj-Iran.
This study is an experimental study that was designed in the form of three groups (two acupressure and coping strategy groups and one control group). The participants by moderate or severe degree based on the Symptoms Premenstrual Screening Tool entered the study. Students in the coping skills training group received intervention for 5 weeks and every week for 60 min. The second intervention group received acupressure intervention for 3 months and twice a day for 60 s each time, in a sitting position, with pressure on the 6th spleen point (SP6). Data collection tools included socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics questionnaire, as well as premenstrual stress questionnaire and stress coping styles questionnaire, which were completed before and 3 months after the intervention. ANCOVA test was used for comparing the variables of premenstrual stress and coping strategy between the investigated groups, controlling the scores of premenstrual stress and coping strategy before the intervention, as well as controlling those socio-demographic variables that had a significant difference between the two groups.
Based on the ANCOVA test adjusted based on the age of first menstruation and pre-intervention premenstrual stress scores, the mean post-intervention premenstrual stress scores in the acupressure group [adjusted mean difference (AMD): - 20.6; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): - 23.1 to - 17.1; P < 0.001] and coping strategy group [AMD: - 20.5; 95% CI - 23.4 to - 16.7; P < 0.001] were significantly lower than that of the control group. Also, based on the post-hoc test, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of the mean post-intervention PMS scores between the two acupressure and the coping strategy groups [AMD: - 0.1; 95% CI - 3.5-2.9; P = 0.995]. Also, the mean post-intervention scores of task-oriented coping subscale [AMD: 30.8; 95% CI 25.6-36.1; P < 0.001] as well as avoidance-oriented coping subscale [AMD: 18.2; 95% CI 14.6-21.8; P < 0.001] were significantly higher than those of the control group, yet in terms of the emotion-oriented coping subscale [AMD: - 26.9; 95% CI - 31.1 to - 22.7; P < 0.001], the scores were significantly lower than those of the control group.
Considering the effect of learning coping strategies and applying acupressure in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual stress, it seems that equipping people with coping skills allows them to cope with stressful situations such as premenstrual syndrome and show a better and more logical response and feel less anxiety, depression, physical problems, and social problems. Furthermore, acupressure can also be used as a non-invasive method alone or as a complementary medicine in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual stress in young girls.

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has emerged as a promising noninvasive treatment for reducing fibroid size and symptoms. The Mirabilis system for ultrasound (US)-guided HIFU introduces a novel technique known as 'shell ablation'. This study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of Mirabilis in a clinical setting, focusing on clinical outcomes.
Sixteen patients with 23 uterine fibroids were treated with the Mirabilis system. Follow-up assessments included US and MRI at baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 9 months, and 1 year after HIFU. Changes in symptoms and QOL were evaluated using the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and HRQOL Questionnaire.
A significant reduction in fibroid volume was observed after HIFU (baseline 182.1 ± 49.3 ml; 1 year: 76.0 ± 37.9 ml, p < 0.001). The symptom severity score significantly declined (baseline 57.2 ± 3.8; 1 year: 30.2 ± 4.9, p < 0.001), correlating with a significant improvement in HRQOL (baseline 47.0 ± 3.9, 1 year: 71.8 ± 5.3, p < 0.001).

Photobiomodulation irradiation was applied to the quadriceps and hamstrings before each of the ten prescribed training sessions, which consisted of three sets of stiff and squats. Participants underwent assessment during sessions, encompassing blood lactate measurements and psychophysiological scales (Numerical Rating Pain Scale for Pain and Rate of Perceived Effort). Additionally, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up evaluations on an isokinetic dynamometer measured peak torque. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA for intra- and inter-group comparisons. No significant inter-group differences or group-time interactions were discerned in lactate concentration or psychophysiological indices.

We investigated the effects of daily quercetin glucoside ingestion on chronic adaptations in muscle strength and MU behavior following resistance training in healthy older adults.
Twenty-six older adults were randomly allocated to two groups that completed 6-week resistance training intervention with the ingestion of either placebo (PLA) or quercetin glycosides (QUE) at 200 mg/day. Maximal voluntary force (MVF) during isometric knee extension, muscle mass, and MU firing behavior during ramp task at 70%MVF were measured before (PRE) and after (POST) intervention.
In both groups, knee extensor MVF was significantly increased (both p < 0.001), and the improvement in QUE (115.1 ± 11.0%) was greater than in PLA (105.3 ± 4.8%) (p < 0.001) by the Mann-Whitney test. Muscle mass was not changed from PRE to POST in PLA or QUE (p > 0.050). At POST, firing rates of Mus with relatively moderate (recruited between 20 and 40%MVF) or higher (recruited between 20 and 40%MVF) recruitment thresholds were higher in QUE than PLA (p < 0.050). There was a significant correlation between %change in MVF and %change in firing rates of MUs with a relatively higher recruitment threshold from PRE to POST (p = 0.018, r = 0.642).
These results suggest that the adaptations of MUs with higher recruitment thresholds explain the greater improvement in muscle strength associated with QUE ingestion.

Allogeneic NK cells were tested against HNSCC cells in vitro and NOG (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγ null) xenograft mouse models for cytotoxicity. In vitro assays demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity against HNSCC cells when NK cells were combined with cetuximab, a phenomenon attributed to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In vivo, the combination therapy exhibited a significant anti-tumor effect compared to either monotherapy, with high NK cell infiltration and cytotoxic activity in the tumor microenvironment.

40063069,Optimizing Engagement With a Smartphone App to Prevent Violence Against Adolescents: Results From a Cluster Randomized Factorial Trial in Tanzania.,"Multiphase Optimization Strategy, adolescents, digital health, engagement, low- and middle-income country, mobile phone, parenting, randomized factorial experiment, violence against children",Journal of medical Internet research,"Violence and abuse exert extensive health, social, and economic burdens on adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. Digital parenting interventions are promising for mitigating risks at scale. However, their potential for public health impact hinges on meaningful engagement with the digital platform.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of 3 intervention design and implementation factors aimed at increasing engagement with a noncommercialized, offline-first smartphone app for caregivers of adolescents in Tanzania, in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, and the Tanzanian national government.
Following Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) principles, we conducted a 2×2×2 cluster randomized factorial trial involving caregivers of adolescents aged 10 to 17 years. Caregivers were recruited by community representatives from 16 urban and periurban communities (ie, clusters) in the Mwanza region of Tanzania. Each cluster was randomized to 1 of 2 levels of each factor: guidance (self-guided or guided via facilitator-moderated WhatsApp groups), app design (structured or unstructured), and preprogram digital support (basic or enhanced). Primary outcomes were automatically tracked measures of engagement (app launches, modules completed, and home practice activities reviewed), with secondary outcomes including modules started, time spent in the app, and positive behaviors logged. Generalized linear mixed-effects models assessed the impact of experimental factors on engagement.
Automatically tracked engagement data from 614 caregivers were analyzed, of which 205 (33.4%) were men. Compared to self-guided participants, receiving guidance alongside the app led to significantly more app launches (mean ratio [MR] 2.93, 95% CI 1.84-4.68; P<.001), modules completed (MR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.58; P=.02), modules started (MR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42; P=.03), time spent in the app (MR 1.45, 95% CI 1.39-1.51; P<.001), and positive behavior logs (MR 2.73, 95% CI 2.07-3.60; P<.001). Compared to the structured design, unstructured design use resulted in significantly more modules completed (MR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26-1.76; P<.001), home practice activity reviews (MR 7.49, 95% CI 5.19-10.82; P<.001), modules started (MR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.52; P=.01), time spent in the app (MR 1.84, 95% CI 1.70-1.99; P<.001), and positive behavior logs (MR 55.68, 95% CI 16.48-188.14; P<.001). While analyses did not detect an effect of enhanced digital support on directly observed engagement, the combination of enhanced digital support and guidance positively influenced engagement across a range of outcomes.
This study is the first to systematically optimize engagement with a digital parenting intervention in a low- and middle-income country. Our findings offer important learnings for developing evidence-based, scalable digital interventions in resource-constrained settings.

40063022,Estimated Effectiveness of Nirsevimab Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus.,,JAMA network open,"Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in clinical trials. Postlicensure monitoring is essential to confirm these benefits in clinical settings.
To estimate the effectiveness of nirsevimab against medically attended RSV infections in infants and to assess how effectiveness varies by disease severity, dosage, and time since immunization.
This test-negative case-control study utilized inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department data from the Yale New Haven Health System. Nirsevimab-eligible infants who were tested for RSV using polymerase chain reaction between October 1, 2023, and May 9, 2024, were included. Infants with RSV-positive results were cases and infants with RSV-negative results were controls.
Nirsevimab immunization, verified through state immunization registries.
Effectiveness was estimated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, calendar month, and potential confounders. Separate models examined estimated effectiveness by clinical setting, dosage, time since immunization, and severity (defined as needing high-flow oxygen or intensive care unit admission). Broader outcomes were also analyzed, including all-cause LRTI and all-cause LRTI-associated hospitalization.
The analytic sample included 3090 infants (1722 male [57.3%]; median [IQR] age at testing, 6.7 [3.6-9.7] months), with 680 (22.0%) RSV-positive cases and 2410 (78.0%) RSV-negative controls. Nirsevimab uptake was 10.7% (330 patients), with 21 RSV-positive cases and 309 RSV-negative controls immunized. Adjusted effectiveness was 68.4% (95% CI, 50.3%-80.8%) against medically attended RSV infection, 61.6% (95% CI, 35.6%-78.6%) against outpatient visits, and 80.5% (95% CI, 52.0%-93.5%) against hospitalizations. The highest estimated effectiveness (84.6%; 95% CI, 58.7%-95.6%) was observed against severe RSV disease. Although estimated effectiveness against RSV infections declined from 79.3% (95% CI, 63.4%-90.6%) at 2 weeks postimmunization to 54.8% (95% CI, 16.3%-74.7%) at 14 weeks postimmunization, it remained significant. Estimated effectiveness did not vary substantially by dosage. During peak RSV season, nirsevimab appeared effective against all-cause LRTI (49.4%; 95% CI, 10.7%-72.9%) and all-cause LRTI-associated hospitalizations (79.1%; 95% CI, 27.6%-94.9%). From February to May 2024, when most LRTIs were caused by other viruses, its estimated effectiveness against these broader outcomes was negligible.
In this case-control study, nirsevimab provided substantial protection against RSV-associated outcomes. These findings support its continued use and provide evidence that may help boost public confidence in the immunization program.",,"The analytic sample included 3090 infants (1722 male [57.3%]; median [IQR] age at testing, 6.7 [3.6-9.7] months), with 680 (22.0%) RSV-positive cases and 2410 (78.0%) RSV-negative controls.

To assess the association of APP with improved clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19 and AHRF, and to identify potential effect modifiers.
PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through August 1, 2024.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining APP in adults with COVID-19 and AHRF that reported intubation rate or mortality were included.
Individual participant data (IPD) were extracted according to PRISMA-IPD guidelines. For binary outcomes, logistic regression was used and odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs were reported, while for continuous outcomes, linear regression was used and mean difference (MD) and 95% CIs were reported.
The primary outcome was survival without intubation. Secondary outcomes included intubation, mortality, death without intubation, death after intubation, escalation of respiratory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, time from enrollment to intubation and death, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and hospital and ICU lengths of stay.
A total of 14 RCTs involving 3019 patients were included; 1542 patients in the APP group (mean [SD] age, 59.3 [14.1] years; 1048 male [68.0%]) and 1477 in the control group (mean [SD] age, 59.9 [14.1] years; 979 male [66.3%]). APP improved survival without intubation (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.20-1.68), and it reduced the risk of intubation (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.84) and hospital mortality (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95). APP also extended the time from enrollment to intubation (MD, 0.93 days; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.42 days). In exploratory subgroup analyses, improved survival without intubation was observed in patients younger than age 68 years, as well as in patients with a body mass index of 26 to 30, early implementation of APP (ie, less than 1 day from hospitalization), a pulse saturation to inhaled oxygen fraction ratio of 155 to 232, respiratory rate of 20 to 26 breaths per minute (bpm), and those receiving advanced respiratory support at enrollment. However, none of the subgroups had significant interaction with APP treatment. APP duration 10 or more hours/d within the first 3 days was associated with increased survival without intubation (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.37-2.49).
This IPD meta-analysis found that in adults with COVID-19 and AHRF, APP was associated with increased survival without intubation and with reduced risks of intubation and mortality, including death after intubation.

40063015,Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities With Donanemab in Early Symptomatic Alzheimer Disease: Secondary Analysis of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 Randomized Clinical Trials.,,JAMA neurology,"Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the major adverse event associated with amyloid-targeting immunotherapy. Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.
To characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.
These prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.
Placebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.
The primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.
Across 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.
ARIA is an adverse event associated with donanemab treatment that requires safety monitoring. Individual ARIA risk can be assessed by APOE ε4 status and baseline imaging findings.

40062986,Effectiveness of technology-based stroke interventions to improve upper limb functioning in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Stroke, rehabilitation, technology, upper extremity (MeSH Terms)",Topics in stroke rehabilitation,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, with low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) representing 69% of stroke incidence. Technology-based interventions offer potential for improving motor function and rehabilitation adherence; however, their impact in LMICs remains unknown.
To measure the efficacy of technological interventions compared to conventional physical rehabilitation in improving post- stroke upper limb motor function in LMICs.
We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020213333) of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from PubMed, Global Index Medicus, and Physiotherapy Evidence Databases. Studies included stroke survivors receiving technological interventions for upper limb rehabilitation. Effectiveness outcomes included upper limb motor function, performance for activities of daily living, and quality of life. A meta-analysis was performed using mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs.
Fifty studies were included after the screening phase, comprising a total of 2646 participants. Nine technological interventions were evaluated, including: virtual reality (40%), robotics (22%), telerehabilitation (10%), among others. Meta-analysis showed significant effect of immersive virtual reality on upper limb function using the Fugl-Meyer Scale (MD 5.65; 95% CI 4.88 to 6.43) and on daily activity performance using the Functional Independence Measure (MD 4,82; 95% CI 2,45-7,19). A significant difference was also found between telerehabilitation and conventional therapy using the modified Barthel index (MD of 3.28; 95% CI 0.86 to 5.70).

International ethical guidelines generally have provisions to perform research without prior consent (RWPC) in circumstances where consent is not feasible, but there is a paucity of data regarding the community acceptance of this process. The objectives of the current study were to explore the attitudes and experiences of parents of children enrolled into trials to determine understanding and acceptability of RWPC to parents of children involved.
Qualitative study of semi structured telephone interviews in 2017 exploring themes of medical research, trial participation in RWPC. Interview transcripts underwent inductive thematic analysis with intercoder agreement, using Nvivo 14 software.
Two clinical interventional trials in Australia conducted in critically ill children without prospective consent.
Parents of children enrolled in critical care research.
None.
A total of 49 interviews were conducted and analyzed. Parents of participants were supportive of processes used in the trials and RWPC. Paperwork was often not thought to contribute to improved understanding, with verbal information more valued. There was no consensus on the optimal approach of RWPC in situations when clinical outcome was poor.
Our study in 2017 shows that parent/carer supported RWPC in two pediatric trials involving critically ill children. Parents were satisfied with existing approval methods and safeguards. Parents valued brief verbal information at the time of randomization.

40062762,Elevating fungal care: bridging Brazil's healthcare practices to global standards.,"Brazil, Europe, MALDI-TOF-MS, PCR, antifungals, diagnosis, invasive fungal infections",Microbiology spectrum,"Brazil faces unique challenges in managing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to diverse ecosystems, a rural workforce, and prevalent health conditions. In Europe, IFIs are primarily associated with transplantation, intensive care, and chronic diseases. Inspired by initiatives in the Caribbean and Latin America in 2019, efforts to map global diagnostic and treatment resources expanded to Africa, Europe, and Asia/Pacific. This study conducts a comparative analysis, mainly drawing data from Brazil and Europe, to investigate IFI epidemiology and management. Data were collected through online surveys distributed to Brazilian and European institutions, with collaborations from scientific organizations. Surveys covered institutional profiles, IFI diagnoses, accessibility to diagnostic techniques, and antifungal drugs. A comparative survey involving 96 Brazilian and 388 European institutions revealed variations in the perception and practices related to fungal pathogens. Differences in ranking and prevalence were observed, along with variations in diagnostic procedures, fluorescence dye usage, culture practices, antifungal medication availability, and technological approaches. Europe exhibited higher utilization rates for molecular diagnostic approaches, including PCR tests, and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was more widespread in Europe compared with Brazil, indicating substantial differences in understanding and managing fungal infections. Customized IFI management is crucial, considering regional differences and addressing technological gaps like underutilized PCR. The study advocates for increased international collaboration, targeted training, and enhanced resources to foster a unified global approach in preventing, diagnosing, and treating IFI.
This work is significant as it highlights the unique challenges Brazil faces in managing invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to its diverse ecosystems and public health landscape. By comparing Brazil's situation with Europe-where IFIs are mainly linked to transplantation and intensive care-this study identifies key disparities in diagnostic and treatment practices. The findings reveal substantial differences in the availability and use of molecular diagnostics, antifungal drugs, and therapeutic drug monitoring, with Europe demonstrating more advanced practices. By mapping these variations, the study underscores the importance of tailored approaches to IFI management that consider regional differences and technological gaps. Ultimately, it calls for enhanced international collaboration, targeted training, and resource allocation to improve IFI outcomes globally, particularly in regions with limited access to advanced diagnostic tools and treatments.",,,,,10.1128/spectrum.02112-24,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Salmanton-García', 'firstname': 'Jon', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Translational Research, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nDepartment I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf (CIO ABCD) and Excellence Center for Medical Mycology (ECMM), University of Cologne, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Falci', 'firstname': 'Diego R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Pontificia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.\nInfectious Diseases Service, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cornely', 'firstname': 'Oliver A', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Translational Research, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nDepartment I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf (CIO ABCD) and Excellence Center for Medical Mycology (ECMM), University of Cologne, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nGerman Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.\nClinical Trials Centre Cologne (ZKS Köln), University of Cologne, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasqualotto', 'firstname': 'Alessandro C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Santa Casa de Misericordia de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.\nFederal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}"

In research areas such as multi-center clinical trials, recurrent events, and genetic studies, proportional hazard mixed effects models (PHMMs) are used to account for correlations observed in clusters within the data. In high dimensions, proper specification of the fixed and random effects within PHMMs is difficult and computationally complex. In this paper, we approximate the proportional hazards mixed effects model with a piecewise constant hazard mixed effects survival model. We estimate the model parameters using a modified Monte Carlo expectation conditional minimization (MCECM) algorithm, allowing us to perform variable selection on both the fixed and random effects simultaneously. We also incorporate a factor model decomposition of the random effects in order to more easily scale the variable selection method to larger dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulations, and we apply our method to a multi-study pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma gene expression dataset to select features important for survival.",,,,© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1002/sim.10311,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Heiling', 'firstname': 'Hillary M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rashid', 'firstname': 'Naim U', 'initials': 'NU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.\nLineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Quefeng', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Xianlu L', 'initials': 'XL', 'affiliation': 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yeh', 'firstname': 'Jen Jen', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.\nDepartment of Surgery, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahim', 'firstname': 'Joseph G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.'}"

Secondary to this, we sought to measure the effectiveness and safety of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) versus conventional laparoscopy (CLS). We search six databases to find studies comparing LESS and CLS for ovarian lesions where removal of the entire ovary, with or without the fallopian tube, is necessary. Criteria used for study eligibility: both controlled trials and observational studies were included in this analysis. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: we used the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for the randomized clinical trials and the national heart, lung, and blood quality assessment tools for the observational studies. The statistical analysis was done using the review manager software. LESS showed a significantly longer operative time [mean difference (MD)=2.96 (-1.97, 7.90), p=0.24], but with moderate heterogeneity. Estimated blood loss was significantly lower for LESS [MD=-18.62 (-33.83, -3.42), p=0.02]. The length of patient hospital stay was comparable [MD=-0.02 (-0.50, 0.47), p=0.95].

The LESS group required less postoperative analgesia [risk ratios (RR)=0.47 (0.32, 0.68), p=0.001]. The change in hemoglobin was comparable [MD=-0.11 (-0.26, 0.03), p=0.14]. Perioperative complications were higher in the LESS group [RR=2.236 (1.031, 4.851), p=0.04]. Compared with CLS, LESS required more operative time but resulted in significantly less blood loss and lower postoperative analgesic use. Hospital stays and VAS pain scores were similar. LESS had a higher incidence of perioperative complications, which questions the feasibility of its use in some situations.

40062662,Efficacy of guided and unguided web-assisted self-help for parents of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder: A three-arm randomized controlled trial.,"ADHD, e‐health, oppositional defiant disorder, parent training, school children","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines","Empirical evidence supports the efficacy of behavioral online parent training. However, further large trials in school-age children with externalizing behavior problems and analyses on the impact of additional therapist support are needed. This three-arm randomized controlled trial examined the efficacy of guided and unguided web-assisted self-help (WASH) for parents of children with externalizing behavior problems.
Parents of 431 children (6-12 years) with elevated externalizing symptoms were randomly assigned to either treatment as usual (TAU), a 6-month behavioral WASH intervention (WASH+TAU), or WASH plus telephone-based support (WASH+S+TAU). Assessments took place at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome was child externalizing symptoms as rated by a clinician blinded to condition; secondary outcomes were parent-rated child externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, functional impairment, quality of life, parenting practices, and parental internalizing symptoms. (German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS): DRKS00013456; URL: https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00013456; registered on January 3rd 2018).
Linear mixed models for repeated measures revealed a significant overall intervention effect on blinded clinician-rated externalizing symptoms at 6 months in both the intention-to-treat sample and per-protocol samples, with at least 25% (PP25) or 40% treatment utilization (PP40), respectively (intention-to-treat: p = .017). Subsequent pairwise comparisons revealed a greater symptom reduction in WASH+S+TAU than in the other conditions (intention-to-treat: WASH+S+TAU vs. WASH+TAU: p = .029, d = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.54, -0.03]; WASH+S+TAU vs. TAU: p = .009, d = 0.34 [-0.59, -0.09]). At 12 months, a significant overall effect on blinded clinician-rated externalizing symptoms only emerged in the PP40 sample (p = .035). Secondary analyses revealed an overall effect on child functional impairment at 12 months (intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses) and on negative parenting behaviors at 6 months in the PP40 sample. For both variables, pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant differences between WASH+S+TAU and TAU.

40062556,A Bayesian framework for safety signal detection from medical device data.,"Dirichlet process prior, hierarchical bayesian analysis, safety signal detection",Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,"Safety evaluation is important during both the pre-market clinical trials and post-market surveillance. In either a pre-market or post-market setting wherein the safety of a device is compared to that of a control device, it is desirable to identify any difference in the safety between two devices as expeditiously as possible. Here, we introduce the Bayesian hierarchical framework for the safety assessment in two-arm clinical trials, with signal detection accomplished by evaluating the effect size of each adverse event (AE) measured by odds ratio or relative risk. The framework starts with a standard hierarchical Bayesian model with a parametric distribution as a common prior for the effect sizes of all AEs. Then, it is extended with a non-parametric prior, Dirichlet Process Prior, to allow for more flexibility. After that, to account for the rare events in some trials, it is further extended with the option of additional zero-inflated parameters and calculation of regularized effect size. Extra incorporation of exposure-time information is available under each framework. The performance of the proposed technique, along with its extensions, is studied by simulation. The application of the proposed Bayesian framework is demonstrated by data from a two-device clinical trial, the newer left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and the existing LVAD. The Bayesian analysis result is then compared to a traditional frequentist technique. Through both simulation and application, the proposed Bayesian technique is shown to be robust to the selection of priors of the variance component, and has comparative and under some scenarios even better performance than the frequentist technique. Overall, the developed Bayesian framework is a feasible alternative to the frequentist method for safety evaluation of medical device clinical trials.",,,,,10.1080/10543406.2025.2464595,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Jianjin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, Office of Clinical Evidence and Analysis, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chakraborty', 'firstname': 'Adrijo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, Office of Clinical Evidence and Analysis, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sachdeva', 'firstname': 'Archie', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiwari', 'firstname': 'Ram', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Global Stat Solutions, Reston, VA, USA.'}"

A DCE was conducted among MIBC patients post-radical cystectomy. Participants were presented with hypothetical treatment options differing in attributes such as efficacy Disease-free survival (DFS), side effects, administration, and cost. Preference data were analyzed to determine each attribute's relative importance (RI), maximum acceptable risk (MAR), and willingness to trade efficacy (WTTE).
Out of 105 patients surveyed, 101 were included in the final analysis. The DCE revealed that DFS had the highest RI (30.3%), followed by annual treatment cost (27.7%) and risk of severe side effects (26.8%). While MAR analysis indicated that patients were willing to accept some increase in side effects risk for significant gains in DFS, WTTE results showed a sensitivity to side effect severity and treatment costs, with patients often willing to trade off DFS for improvements in risks and costs. In subgroup analyses, such as pathological stage, age, and employment status, the trends for each subgroup were the same as those of the overall population. However, the magnitude of RI varied among patients with different characteristics. For example, younger patients preferred short-term treatment duration over longer, employed patients tended to favor long-term treatment duration.

We conducted a single-center, phase 1 prospective study (ChiCTR2200065634) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide, demethylating drugs (azacitidine), cytarabine, aclacinomycin, and G-CSF plus venetoclax (CDCAG-VEN) in patients with R/R AML. The previous CDCAG regimen was used as a historical control to compare its efficacy and safety. Thirty and 22 patients received one course of CDCAG with or without a 14-day course of venetoclax, respectively.
The overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in the CDCAG-VEN group than in the CDCAG-treated group (78.6% vs. 45.5%; p = 0.015), and the CDCAG-VEN group achieved a better trend of measurable residual disease-negative response (61.1% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.134). Compared with the CDCAG group, the CDCAG-VEN group exhibited significantly better 1-year overall survival (63.3% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.005) and progression-free survival (76.7% vs. 36.0%, p = 0.022). The duration of response was notably better in the CDCAG-VEN group than in the CDCAG group (71.2% vs. 34.3%, p = 0.021) and had a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (22.2% vs. 48.9%, p = 0.095).

40062461,Persistent aura without infarction.,,Current opinion in neurology,"The scope of this review is to discuss persistent aura without infarction, a rare, highly disabling, yet apparently benign clinical condition, straddling neurology, neuro-ophthalmology, and psychiatry, whose differential diagnosis is essential for an appropriate therapeutic approach and to avoid clinical complications. Here we attempt to report on the available literature, trying to present a summary, despite the scarcity of available literature.
Persistent aura without infarction is a diagnostic challenge, likely caused by cortical spreading depression and vasoconstriction, whose clinical features are not always easy to pigeonhole into the available diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis requires the exclusion of cerebral and retinal infarction, structural changes in the brain, epilepsy, and psychiatric symptoms. Triptans may be deleterious, anticoagulants are not indicated, and therapy with acetazolamide, valproic acid, zonisamide, furosemide, cortisone, and ketamine may be beneficial.
Persistent aura without infarction is a challenging diagnosis. However, an approach using zonisamide and ketamine might be beneficial.

This study aims to identify and synthesize the risk factors contributing to ir-SAEs in patients with cancer.
Adhering to the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search across multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Clinical Trials, China Biomedical Literature Database, CNKI, Wanfang Database, and VIP Database. Studies published from the inception of each database up to 28 January 2024 were considered. Two independent reviewers screened the literature and extracted the relevant data.

Our aim, to review the scientific literature of the year 2024, is challenged by the enormous number of publications. Therefore, if your article is not included or your favorite field of mycobacteriology not covered, please forgive us. Our ""Year in Review"" is very much clinically oriented with lesser emphasis on basic science, microbiology, and biotechnology.
Members of the steering committee of the Tuberculosis Network European Trials group (TBnet; www.tbnet.eu) report on 139 publications in the fields of epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of tuberculosis and NTM diseases published in 2024 that we found particularly important. We report publications separately for tuberculosis in children and adults and for NTM disease and provide a brief overview of newer technologies in the diagnostic pipeline. Furthermore, we summarize priorities for tuberculosis and NTM disease research, development, and implementation, all of which represent the perspective of our combined clinical experience.

Moreover, stress responses are more severe in older adult patients. Therefore, precision medicine is required to improve the quality of nursing care and promote postoperative recovery in gastrointestinal surgery.
To establish an evidence-based ERAS model based on stress response nursing care and demonstrate nursing benefits through clinical practice.
This randomized clinical trial first established an evidence-based nursing ERAS protocol in older adult patients based on literature related to perioperative nursing measures for gastrointestinal surgery stress response. Next, 392 older adult patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery and were admitted to our hospital between December 2021 and June 2023 were categorized into two groups to receive evidence-based (study group) or conventional (control group) ERAS nursing models, respectively. Intraoperative physiological parameters during surgery and postoperative recovery indicators were compared between the groups.
Among 64 domestic and international studies, the stress responses of older adult patients mainly included emotional anxiety, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal discomfort, physical weakness, pain, and swelling. The appropriate nursing interventions included comprehensive psychological counseling, pre- and postoperative nutritional support, temperature control, pain management, and rehabilitation training. Compared with the control group, the study group showed lower heart rate, mean arterial pressure, blood glucose level, and adrenaline level; shorter duration of drainage tube placement, time to first flatus, time to first ambulation, and postoperative hospital stay; lower anxiety scores on postoperative day 3; and lower incidences of postoperative infection, obstruction, poor wound healing, and gastrointestinal reactions were lower in the study group (all

40062181,The Non-inferiority of Telemedicine in Pre-anesthesia Clinic at a Tertiary Cancer Care Center: A Randomized Study.,"cancer care, non-inferiority, patient satisfaction, pre-anesthesia consultation, telemedicine",Cureus,"Background With the increasing demand for cancer care and advancements in digital health, telemedicine has emerged as a promising tool to enhance healthcare accessibility and efficiency. Its application in pre-anesthesia consultations (PAC) has the potential to address logistical challenges while maintaining clinical quality. Purpose This study assesses whether telemedicine is a non-inferior alternative to traditional face-to-face pre-anesthesia consultations (PAC) for cancer surgery patients at a tertiary care center and evaluates discrepancies between PAC findings and pre-surgical assessments. Methods This prospective, randomized non-inferiority study included patients aged 20 years or older with access to internet and video calling. The participants were randomly allocated to either a telemedicine PAC or a face-to-face PAC group in a 1:1 ratio. An eight-item questionnaire on a 10-point scale was used to measure patient satisfaction after the consultation, while a 12-item questionnaire on the same scale assessed anesthesiologists' satisfaction. We also compared airway examination findings between the PAC and pre-surgical assessments to detect any discrepancies. Results Of 120 patients assessed, 100 met the inclusion criteria and were randomized (50 per group). Baseline characteristics were similar across groups. Physician satisfaction scores were comparable between telemedicine and face-to-face consultations (7.18 versus 7.58, p=0.113), as were patient satisfaction scores (6.94 versus 7.26, p=0.251). Airway examination findings were consistent, with no significant discrepancies. Conclusion Telemedicine was found to be non-inferior to face-to-face consultations for pre-anesthesia assessments in terms of patient and physician satisfaction, as well as clinical accuracy. These findings support the integration of telemedicine into routine pre-anesthesia practice, particularly in high-demand settings such as cancer care. Further research is warranted to evaluate broader clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.",,,,"Copyright © 2025, Maurya et al.",10.7759/cureus.78596,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Maurya', 'firstname': 'Prateek', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Onco-Anesthesia and Palliative Medicine, Dr. B.

40062154,Assessment of the Efficacy and Pulmonary Toxicity of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in HER2-Positive and HER2-Low Metastatic Breast Cancer in a Tertiary Center in the United Arab Emirates.,"her2-low expression, her2-positive, interstitial lung disease, metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab deruxtecan",Cureus,"Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in patients who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen. T-DXd is also indicated for unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, following prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or recurrent disease within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in treating HER2-positive and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients in a real-world clinical setting. In the T-DXd pivotal research, imaging assessments were conducted every six weeks with CT or MRI, but outside of a clinical trial setting, this frequent imaging is practically challenging due to resources and difficulty in reimbursing. In addition to clinical outcome assessments, we sought to review the incidence of pneumonitis in a real-world setting and to assess if the three-monthly response assessment scans would be sufficient to rule out asymptomatic pneumonitis.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients diagnosed with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or in situ hybridization (ISH) positive) or HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+ and ISH negative) MBC treated with T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg every 21 days, with standardized dose adjustments as required. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median follow-up duration was 15 months. Responses were assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, and toxicity was determined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Data analysis was performed using SPSS IBM software version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, NY, US).
The median age of the patients was 47 years, ranging from 29 to 86 years, with the majority being younger than 65 and predominantly women. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 at baseline. Most patients were HER2-positive, while a smaller proportion were classified as HER2-low. A significant number of patients presented with visceral disease, while a smaller subset had brain metastases at the time of baseline evaluation. Nearly half of the patients were hormone receptor-positive (HR+), and more than half had a high Ki-67 index of over 20%. The majority of patients received T-DXd as a second- or third-line treatment. Clinical responses included partial response, complete response, and stable disease. Survival outcomes showed high overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 24 months. Only one patient experienced grade 3 pneumonitis, suggesting that 12-weekly imaging assessments may be adequate for monitoring most patients.
Our real-world experience confirms that the efficacy of T-DXd in UAE is consistent with published data from published phase 3 clinical trials. The incidence of clinical pulmonary toxicity is much lower than anticipated, and until further data is available, it may be reasonable to continue using the 12-weekly assessment scans to monitor patients for interstitial lung disease (ILD). Further studies are needed to determine the optimal imaging frequency for monitoring ILD.",,"The median age of the patients was 47 years, ranging from 29 to 86 years, with the majority being younger than 65 and predominantly women.

Neural regeneration, which refers to the regrowth or repair of nerve tissue or cells, holds promise as a therapeutic approach for SCI. This narrative review explores the current state of neural regeneration for SCI treatment, including endogenous neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, neuroremediation, and cell-based therapies. The review is based on a search of literature from the past 20 years, conducted via databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. While many of the studies show promising results, the majority are preclinical, highlighting the need for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies in humans. Among the different therapeutic approaches, cell-based therapies, particularly the use of neural stem cells, have shown the most promising results in promoting neural regeneration and functional recovery in animal models and human trials. Therefore, neural stem cell transplantation is considered the most useful treatment method for SCI. However, further research is needed to optimize the transplantation procedure, improve cell survival, and enhance functional outcomes in patients with SCI.",,,,"Copyright © 2025, Gartit et al.",10.7759/cureus.78630,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Gartit', 'firstname': 'Mohammed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Mohammed First University, Oujda, MAR.\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda, MAR.'}, {'lastname': 'Noumairi', 'firstname': 'Mohammed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda, MAR.'}, {'lastname': 'Rhoul', 'firstname': 'Abdelilah', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Mohammed First University, Oujda, MAR.\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda, MAR.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahla', 'firstname': 'Houssam', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Mohammed First University, Oujda, MAR.\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda, MAR.'}, {'lastname': 'El Anbari', 'firstname': 'Younes', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed First University, Oujda, MAR.\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda, MAR.'}, {'lastname': 'El Oumri', 'firstname': 'Ahmed Amine', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Mohammed First University, Oujda, MAR.\nPhysical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mohammed VI University Hospital, Oujda, MAR.'}"

Like other biological drugs, CAR-T cell products can trigger unwanted immune responses in patients receiving the treatment. This might lead to treatment failure or life-threatening consequences. This immunogenicity could also affect the CAR-T cells' cellular kinetics and clinical responses. In this review, we summarize the immunogenicity of biologics and their effects on PK/PD profiles, safety, and efficacy. We also introduce the mechanisms of immunogenicity induced by CAR-T cells and clinical evidence of immunogenicity of the currently FDA-approved CAR-T cell products. Particularly, we summarize the currently available immunogenicity data from each CAR-T cell product's clinical trials, immunogenicity assays, sample types, and preclinical efficacy models, which were retrieved from the FDA and EMA websites.

40061912,Cost-effectiveness analysis of switching from a bivalent to a nonavalent HPV vaccination programme in China: a modelling study.,"Cost-effectiveness, Elimination, Human papillomavirus vaccination, Mixed schedule, Nonavalent",The Lancet regional health. Western Pacific,"Several domestically-manufactured nonavalent HPV vaccine candidates are in phase III clinical trials and their future availability may address the current dilemma of insufficient supply and high price of the overseas-manufactured nonavalent HPV vaccine in China. We compare the population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of switching to nonavalent HPV vaccination in China.
We used a previously validated transmission model to project the lifetime costs and effectiveness of five same-vaccine and two mixed-vaccine strategies. Nonavalent HPV vaccines were assumed to be available and meet the production requirements for national vaccination between 2030 and 2050. All women living or projected to be born in China during 2023-2100 were considered. We adopted a societal perspective and determined optimal strategies using cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers.
Under our pricing assumptions, switching to nonavalent vaccination was always cost-saving compared with maintaining the current bivalent vaccination programme, irrespective of the screening scenarios and the year when nonavalent vaccine was assumed to become available (status quo screening: net cost saving $2589-5211 million; improved screening: net cost saving $1852-3789 million). In the same-vaccine strategies, the optimal strategy changed from ""routine nonavalent HPV vaccination with catch-up to age 18"" to ""switching from bivalent to nonavalent HPV vaccination"" if nonavalent vaccination is available after 2035. Compared with the optimal same-vaccine strategy, adopting mixed schedules with bivalent and nonavalent vaccines would further save $1336-4280 million net costs and gain 87,000-833,000 QALYs, depending on the screening scenario and the year when nonavalent vaccine becomes available.
Switching from bivalent to nonavalent HPV vaccination is likely to be cost-saving and have a significant impact on reducing the cervical cancer burden in China.

We provide updates on recent, promising trials for high-risk NMIBC and newly FDA approved therapies.
Several therapies with diverse mechanisms of action have shown favorable results in both BCG-naïve and BCG-unresponsive settings for NMIBC. These treatments include intravenous and intravesical immunotherapies, viral- and bacterial-based intravesical therapies, combination intravesical chemotherapy regimens, and novel methods of intravesical chemotherapy administration.

40061893,Risk stratification in neuroblastoma patients through machine learning in the multicenter PRIMAGE cohort.,"PRIMAGE, machine learning, neuroblastoma, overall survival, pediatric, risk stratification",Frontiers in oncology,"Neuroblastoma, the most prevalent solid cancer in children, presents significant biological and clinical heterogeneity. This inherent heterogeneity underscores the need for more precise prognostic markers at the time of diagnosis to enhance patient stratification, allowing for more personalized treatment strategies. In response, this investigation developed a machine learning model using clinical, molecular, and magnetic resonance (MR) radiomics features at diagnosis to predict patient's overall survival (OS) and improve their risk stratification.
PRIMAGE database, including 513 patients (discovery cohort), was used for model training, validation, and testing. Additional 22 patients from different hospitals served as an external independent cohort. Primary tumor segmentation on T2-weighted MR images was semi-automatically edited by an experienced radiologist. From this area, 107 radiomics features were extracted. For the development of the prediction model, radiomics features were harmonized following the nested ComBat methodology and nested cross-validation approach was employed to determine the optimal preprocessing and model configuration.
The discovery cohort yielded a 78.8 ± 4.9 and 77.7 ± 6.1 of C index and time-dependent area under de curve (AUC), respectively, over the test set, with a random survival forest exhibiting the best performance. In the independent cohort, a C-index of 93.4 and a time-dependent AUC of 95.4 were achieved. Interpretability analysis identified lesion heterogeneity, size, and molecular variables as crucial factors in OS prediction. The model stratified neuroblastoma patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories, demonstrating a superior stratification compared to standard-of-care classification system in both cohorts.

The management of PFCD remains a critical challenge in inflammatory bowel disease, primarily due to limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis, complicating medical treatment. Increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-13 by infiltrating macrophages and other inflammatory cells stimulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, resulting in activation of myofibroblasts and elevation of matrix metalloproteinases, leading to fistula formation. Given the potential for malignant transformation, PFCD screening is critical. Cytokine and inflammation-targeted therapies can help control this disease, but recurrence is a common complication. Surgical interventions such as fistulotomy represent viable therapeutic options, with magnetic resonance imaging serving as an important diagnostic tool for delineating fistula tract anatomy. Animal models and clinical trials demonstrate that injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the fistula results in suppression of the inflammatory cells and cytokines and complete resolution of PFCD. Recently, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles were found to stimulate fistula healing, with encouraging results. In this article, we comment on the review article by Pacheco ",,,,©The Author(s) 2025.

Higher heart rate may result in perioperative myocardial injury through demand-supply mismatch. Alternatively, higher heart rates may reflect autonomic dysfunction that promotes myocardial injury independently of heart rate. The specific hyperpolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)-4 (funny) channel inhibitor ivabradine slows the heart rate without altering autonomic control, blood pressure, or myocardial contractility. We hypothesise that individuals with autonomic dysfunction may benefit most from ivabradine reducing heart rate control to minimise myocardial injury-associated morbidity.

40061473,The impact of core training combined with breathing exercises on individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain.,"breathing exercises, chronic non-specific low back pain, core training, exercise therapy, functional improvement, pain management",Frontiers in public health,"Chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP) is a common condition, defined as pain lasting more than 3 months between the lower thoracic margin and gluteal folds, without identifiable tissue damage. Despite its low disability rate, the complex etiology and high recurrence impose significant health and socioeconomic burdens. According to European LBP guidelines, exercise therapy is the preferred treatment for CNLBP. This study evaluates the efficacy of core training combined with breathing exercises as a therapeutic intervention for CNLBP.
Eighteen CNLBP patients were randomly assigned to three groups: core training only, core training with breathing exercises, and a control group. A 12-week intervention included VAS, ODI scores, and muscle strength tests.
The combined group showed significantly greater pain reduction, functional improvement, and muscle strength enhancement compared to the other groups.

The aim of this study is to determine whether implementing Action Observation Therapy (AOT) in a population with MCI would yield positive outcomes in cognitive status, in activities of daily living (ADLs), upper limb (UL) functionality, gait and balance, and if these results differ based on the observation modality employed.
Thirty participants, aged 65 and above with MCI, were assigned to three groups: therapist observation group (TOG), peer observation group (POG), and control group (CG). The intervention comprised physical and cognitive exercises over 5 weeks, with assessments before and after.
significant differences in post-intervention improvement were found between the groups, excluding the Box and block test. No significant differences were found between the TOG and POG in any improvement variable. Significant differences were found between the CG and the observation groups.

Evidence for the role of disrupted sleep in the onset and maintenance of each diagnostic category is considered.
Although subjective sleep complaints are common and transdiagnostic among youth with psychiatric disorders, evidence for disruptions in traditional polysomnographic measures (e.g., total sleep time) is inconsistent. However, physiological sleep abnormalities (e.g., delta or sigma power, rapid eye-movement density) may characterize specific mental health conditions. Overall, sleep disturbances appear to be precursors to, and sustainers of, psychiatric symptoms in youth.
Future studies may elucidate physiological sleep processes underlying subjective sleep complaints in youth with psychiatric disorders and would benefit from polysomnographic methodology standardization, diverse/representative samples, incorporation of circadian measures, and inclusion of polysomnography as an outcome in behavioral sleep intervention clinical trials.",,,,,10.1007/s40675-024-00300-0,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Lunsford-Avery', 'firstname': 'Jessica R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Falls', 'firstname': 'Allison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Duke University, College of Arts and Sciences, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cary', 'firstname': 'Sophia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Duke University, College of Arts and Sciences, Durham, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duke', 'firstname': 'Naomi N', 'initials': 'NN', 'affiliation': 'Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Durham, NC, USA.\nDuke University, Department of Sociology, Durham, NC, USA.'}"

Participants were between the ages of 18-64 years, had baseline negative symptoms and a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Those included were screened for an AGA IgG >20 U, no serologic evidence of celiac disease, and stable antipsychotic treatment and dose. All participants were inpatients, received a GFD and were randomized to 30 grams of gluten or rice flour daily delivered in protein shakes.

40061232,Effects of 440-Hz ,"Fast tempo music, Physical performance, Psychophysiological responses, Specific exercise, Tone frequencies",PeerJ,"Preferred music has been shown to enhance psychological and physiological parameters in order to increase physical performance in high intensity exercises. However, the effects of preferred music are less conclusive with different frequencies. The present study assessed the effects of listening to preferred music during warm-up at different frequencies on physical performance and psychophysiological responses specific in male and female kickboxers.
In a double-blind crossover study design, fifteen men and thirteen women kickboxers randomly performed the intermittent kickboxing anaerobic speed test (IKAST) after listening to preferred music around 440 Hz (PM44Hz), or 432 Hz (PM432Hz) frequencies or no music during warm-up. Physical performance indices, heart rate, blood lactate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and feeling scale (FS) were measured.
Warm-up with PM440 Hz significantly improved IKAST performance indices with the highest impact velocity and FS, lowest mean heart rate and RPE, followed by PM432 Hz for both sexes compared to the control condition. For sex interaction, men had lower heart rate with PM440Hz, women the lowest with PM432Hz. In addition, women had higher positive feeling scale with PM440Hz, while men did not experience any significant change between the two musical conditions.
PM440Hz during warm-up was found to be more effective in improving specific performance, positive mood with a potential dissociation from discomfort during the test. Also, women were more affected by the music frequency difference compared to men.",,"Warm-up with PM440 Hz significantly improved IKAST performance indices with the highest impact velocity and FS, lowest mean heart rate and RPE, followed by PM432 Hz for both sexes compared to the control condition.

40061141,Non-targeted effects of stereotactic radiotherapy: a review of the evidence coming from the clinical field.,"Stereotactic radiotherapy, abscopal, distant bystander, immune response, non-targeted effect, radiosurgery",Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy,"Preclinical animal studies have demonstrated that radiation treatment (RT) can induce effects beyond the anatomical site of irradiation. Non-targeted effects of RT (NTER) have been sporadically reported in clinical settings. However, with the advent of high-dose stereotactic radiation techniques (SRT) and immunotherapy (IT), renewed attention has been given to NTER. This systematic review aims to summarize current knowledge about NTER across various malignancies, with a focus on cases involving SRT.
A systematic database search was performed, and records were screened following PRISMA guidelines. Only full-text original articles written in English and reporting clinical studies involving NTER after SRT were included. The results are categorized by cancer type, with separate general and critical analyses.
Sixty-three studies were reviewed, including 32 case reports/case series, 18 retrospective studies, and 13 prospective studies, predominantly published after 2018. NTER was most frequently observed in melanoma and lung cancer and commonly reported as the abscopal effect (AE), albeit with varying criteria. In most cases, IT with suboptimal response was ongoing at the time of SRT, and the median time to NTER onset was 3 months. Overall, NTER was documented in 297 patients: 34 from single cases and 263 from a pool of 1,212 evaluable patients (22%) across other studies. Prospective trials reported an NTER rate of 36%, rising to 56% in lung cancer.
In prospective clinical studies, the phenomenon of NTER following SRT has been observed in a significant proportion of patients. Nevertheless, the literature is limited, with small patient cohorts. Interest in NTER has grown, particularly in the context of IT. Standardization of definitions and reporting, along with the conduct of more clinical trials, is essential to better understand how NTER can be induced by SRT.",,"Sixty-three studies were reviewed, including 32 case reports/case series, 18 retrospective studies, and 13 prospective studies, predominantly published after 2018.

40061139,Unmasking the potential: mechanisms of neuroinflammatory modulation by oncolytic viruses in glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma, combined therapies, cytokines, neuroinflammation, oncolytic virotherapy, tumor microenvironment",Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy,"Glioblastoma, an aggressive and lethal brain tumor, presents enormous clinical challenges, including molecular heterogeneity, high recurrence rates, resistance to conventional therapies, and limited therapeutic penetration across the blood-brain barrier. The glioblastoma microenvironment, characterized by a dynamic interplay of cellular and non-cellular components, is a key driver of tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Neuroinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, play pivotal roles in this microenvironment, contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion. This review highlights oncolytic virotherapy as a promising therapeutic avenue, focusing on its potential to modulate neuroinflammatory responses, induce localized immune reactions, and deliver immunomodulatory factors directly to the tumor site. While encouraging outcomes have been observed, challenges such as overcoming the blood-brain barrier, managing host antiviral immunity, and mitigating potential risks to normal neuronal cells remain critical barriers to clinical translation. By analyzing the intricate interactions of oncolytic viruses with the glioblastoma microenvironment and synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical trials, this review provides actionable insights into developing personalized and effective therapeutic strategies for this aggressive tumor based on oncolytic virotherapy alone or when using it combined with conventional therapies, immunotherapy, natural killer-cell therapy, chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, and dendritic cell therapy.",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.,"10.37349/etat.2025.1002294

40061133,Releasing the brakes: the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in laryngeal cancer.,"CTLA-4, Laryngeal cancer, PD-1/PD-L1, clinical trials, immune checkpoint inhibitors, immune-related adverse events, nivolumab, pembrolizumab",Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy,"Laryngeal cancer, a subtype of head and neck cancer, poses significant challenges due to its profound impact on essential functions such as speech and swallowing and poor survival rates in advanced stages. Traditional treatments-surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy-are often associated with high morbidity and substantial recurrence rates, emphasizing the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized oncology by countering tumor-induced immune evasion, restoring immune surveillance, and activating T-cell responses against cancer. This review examines the role of ICIs in laryngeal cancer management, with a focus on pembrolizumab and nivolumab (anti-PD-1 agents), which are clinically established, as well as investigational therapies such as dostarlimab (anti-PD-1), atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). Pembrolizumab, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and 5-fluorouracil, is approved as a first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), based on evidence from the Keynote-048 trial. This pivotal trial demonstrated significant overall survival (OS) benefits over the cetuximab-based standard regimen. Similarly, nivolumab showed improved OS in the CheckMate-141 trial, supporting its approval as a second-line therapy for patients with platinum-refractory disease. ICIs have shown durable survival benefits and a more manageable toxicity profile compared to traditional chemotherapy. Immune-related adverse events are generally mild and controllable; however, in some cases, they can become severe and even life-threatening. Furthermore, ICIs are being investigated in combination with radiotherapy, as well as in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, where preliminary findings suggest these approaches may enhance efficacy, preserve organ function, and overcome resistance to conventional treatments. The integration of ICIs into multimodal treatment strategies holds promise for transforming the therapeutic landscape of advanced laryngeal cancer. This review synthesizes current evidence, highlights ongoing research, and explores strategies to enhance survival and quality of life for patients facing this challenging malignancy.",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.,"10.37349/etat.2025.1002292

40061044,Progress in the Application of Molecular Hydrogen in Medical Skin Cosmetology.,"hydrogen, hydrogen-rich water, molecular hydrogen, skin beauty","Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology","Molecular hydrogen is a colorless, tasteless, biologically active small-molecule gas with reducing properties, demonstrating therapeutic and preventive effects across various human systems. Its mechanisms of action include selective antioxidation, anti-inflammatory effects, apoptosis inhibition, and the regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways. In the skin, molecular hydrogen reduces oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting oxidative stress, leading to improvements in texture and tone. It also regulates the inflammatory response, alleviating redness, itching, and discomfort, while promoting skin repair and regeneration. Moreover, hydrogen activates antioxidant enzymes in skin cells, boosting their antioxidant capacity and delaying aging. Clinical trials show that molecular hydrogen significantly improves conditions like acne, chloasma, and skin sensitivity. However, research in skin cosmetology remains in its early stages, with unanswered questions regarding mechanisms of action, optimal dosage, and long-term safety. Further investigation through clinical trials is essential for expanding its applications in this field. Molecular hydrogen holds significant promise in skin cosmetology, and as research and technology evolve, it is expected to drive innovations and breakthroughs in skin care. This review examines the therapeutic potential, mechanisms, and clinical applications of molecular hydrogen in skin cosmetology, addressing challenges and proposing pathways for future advancements in this field.",,,,© 2025 Guo and Zhang.,"10.2147/CCID.S500255

40061013,Advances and challenges in cell therapy for neuropathic pain based on mesenchymal stem cells.,"mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), nerve damage, neuropathic pain (NPP), translpantation, treatment",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,"Neuropathic pain (NPP) is caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Its prominent symptoms are spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia and abnormal pain. This pain is long-lasting and unbearable, seriously affecting the patient's quality of life. At present, the clinical treatment effect of painkillers to relieve NPP is still not ideal, nor can it repair damaged nerves and achieve long-term treatment results. In recent years, the application of cell therapy strategies in the field of pain has yielded encouraging results, including preclinical studies and clinical trials. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent progenitor cells derived from mesogenesis. They have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types and have been widely studied and applied in the field of neuroregenerative medicine. MSCs play an important mechanism functional role in promoting injured nerve regeneration and pain relief by regulating multiple processes in target cells, including immunoregulation, anti-inflammatory properties, promoting axon regeneration and re-myelination, promoting angiogenesis, and secreting neurotrophic factors. Moreover, MSCs can also release exosomes, which may be part of their analgesic effects. Exosomes derived from MSC also have the functional properties of mother cells and have therapeutic potential for treating NPP by promoting cell proliferation, regulating inflammatory responses, reducing cell death, promoting axon regeneration and angiogenesis. Therefore, in this article, we discussed current treatment strategies for NPP and explored the functional role and mechanism of MSCs in the treatment of NPP. We also analyzed the current problems and challenges in the application of MSCs in clinical trials of NPP.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 Zhang, Pi, Hu, Liu and Wu.","10.3389/fcell.2025.1536566

40060891,Unveiling circulating targets in pancreatic cancer: Insights from proteogenomic evidence and clinical cohorts.,"Clinical finding, Health sciences, Proteomics",iScience,"Pancreatic cancer (PC), characterized by the absence of effective biomarkers and therapies, remains highly fatal. Data regarding the correlations between PC risk and individual plasma proteome known for minimally invasive biomarkers are scarce. Here, we analyzed 1,345 human plasma proteins using proteome-wide association studies, identifying 78 proteins significantly associated with PC risk. Of these, four proteins (ROR1, FN1, APOA5, and ABO) showed the most substantial causal link to PC, confirmed through Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. Data from two clinical cohorts further demonstrated that FN1 and ABO were notably overexpressed in both blood and tumor samples from PC patients, compared to healthy controls or para-tumor tissues. Additionally, elevated FN1 and ABO levels correlated with shorter median survival in patients. Multiple drugs targeting FN1 or ROR1 are available or in clinical trials. These findings suggest that plasma protein FN1 associated with PC holds potential as both prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",,,,© 2025 The Authors.

40060577,"Comparative Molecular, Innate, and Adaptive Impacts of Chemically Diverse STING Agonists.",,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,"Pharmacologic activation of the innate immune response is being actively being pursued for numerous clinical purposes including enhancement of vaccine potency and potentiation of anti-cancer immunotherapy. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) represent especially useful targets for these efforts as their engagement by agonists can trigger signaling pathways that associate with phenotypes desirable for specific immune outcomes. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an ER-resident PRR reactive to cyclic dinucleotides such as those synthesized endogenously in response to cytosolic dsDNA. STING activation leads to transient generation of type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory responses that augment immunologically relevant effects including antiviral responses, antigen presentation, immune cell trafficking, and immunogenic cell death. In recent years engineered cyclic dinucleotides and small molecules have been discovered that induce STING and safely confer clinically useful outcomes in animal models such as adjuvanticity of anti-microbial vaccines and tumor clearance. Unfortunately, clinical trials examining the efficacy of STING agonists have thus far failed to satisfactorily recapitulate these positive outcomes and this has prevented their translational advancement. A likely relevant yet perplexingly under investigated aspect of pharmacologic STING activation is the diversity of molecular and immune responses that associate with chemical properties of the agonist. Based on this, a comparative survey of these was undertaken using unrelated STING-activating molecules to characterize the molecular, innate, cellular, and immune outcomes they elicit. This was done to inform and direct future studies aimed at designing and selecting agonists appropriate for desired clinical goals. This revealed demonstrable differences between the agonists in potency, transcriptomes, cytokine secretion profiles, immune cell trafficking, and antigen-directed humoral and cell mediated immune responses. As such, this work illustrates that phenotypes deriving from activation of a protein target can be linked to chemical properties of the engaging agonist and thus heightened scrutiny is necessary when selecting molecules to generate specific ",,,,,10.1101/2025.02.21.639458,2025-03-10,"{'lastname': 'Mizuno', 'firstname': 'Nobuyo', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Boehm', 'firstname': 'Dylan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jimenez-Perez', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Abraham', 'firstname': 'Jinu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Springgay', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Rose', 'firstname': 'Ian', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'DeFilippis', 'firstname': 'Victor R', 'initials': 'VR', 'affiliation': None}"

Europe,"An increasing number of liver resections are performed laparoscopically, while laparoscopic resection of lesions in the posterosuperior segments is technically challenging. We aimed to assess the outcomes of laparoscopic and open parenchymal preserving resection of lesions in the posterosuperior segments in a randomised controlled trial.
In this multicentre, patient-blinded, superiority randomised controlled trial, patients requiring parenchymal preserving liver resection for tumours in segment 4a, 7, or 8 were enrolled at 17 centres and randomised 1:1 to laparoscopic or open surgery using a minimisation scheme stratifying for centre and lesion size. The primary endpoint was time to functional recovery measured in postoperative days. To detect a difference in time to functional recovery of two days the sample size needed 250 patients, an interim analysis was planned with 125 patients. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03270917.
Between November 2017 and November 2021, 251 patients were randomised to laparoscopic (n = 125) or open (n = 126) surgery. The majority of patients had a preoperative diagnosis of cancer (225/246 = 91.5%). Time to functional recovery was 3 days (IQR 3-5) in the laparoscopic group compared to 4 days (IQR 3-5) in the open group (difference -19.2%, 96% CI -28.8% to -8.4%; p < 0.001). Hospital stay was similarly shorter in the laparoscopic group (4 days, IQR 3-5 versus 5 days, IQR 4-7; p < 0.001). There were three deaths in the laparoscopic group (3/122 = 2.5%) and one in the open group (1/124 = 0.8%) within 90 days of resection (p = 0.336). Overall postoperative morbidity, severe morbidity, liver-specific morbidity, and readmission were not statistically significant different between the groups. The radical resection (R0) rate in patients with cancer was comparable (laparoscopic 93/106 = 87.7% versus open 97/113 = 85.8%, p = 0.539).
For patients with lesions in the posterosuperior segments of the liver, laparoscopic surgery, as compared to open surgery, reduces time to functional recovery. However, this reduction in time to functional recovery did not meet the hypothesized difference in time to functional recovery of two days.

Our group recently reported that tricaprin, unlike other medium-chain triglycerides, showed reverse remodelliing of AAA in a rat model. Determining whether this basic finding could be translated to clinical practice is important. The 
On estime qu'environ 2 à 12 % des personnes âgées de plus de 65 ans dans le monde sont atteintes d'un anévrisme de l'aorte abdominale (AAA), avec un taux de mortalité supérieur à 60 % en cas de rupture. La seule intervention préventive contre cette rupture est une intervention chirurgicale opportune, qui nécessite des ressources médicales considérables, y compris la gestion des complications postopératoires. Bien que de nombreux essais cliniques randomisés aient été réalisés, aucun médicament oral ne traite efficacement l'AAA. La tricaprine, un triglycéride à chaîne moyenne contenant 3 acides capriques, est utilisée dans la thérapie diététique pour les troubles métaboliques et neurologiques. Notre groupe a récemment rapporté que la tricaprine, contrairement à d'autres triglycérides à chaîne moyenne, présentait un remodelage inversé de l'AAA dans un modèle de rat. Il est important de déterminer si cette découverte fondamentale peut être transposée à la pratique clinique. L'essai clinique F-HAAAT (pour ",,,,"© 2024 The Authors.

40060198,Protocol for the development of an intervention to improve the use of Point-of-caRE DiagnostICs in the management of respiraTOry tRact infectionS in primary care (the PREDICTORS study).,"Point-of-care test, antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance, community pharmacist, general practitioner, primary care, respiratory tract infection",HRB open research,"Antimicrobial resistance is a significant global health challenge, exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, particularly in primary care where up to 50% of antibiotic prescriptions prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) and dispensed by community pharmacists (CPs) are deemed inappropriate. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most common conditions leading to GP consultations and subsequent antibiotic prescribing, much of which is inappropriate as most RTIs are viral in nature or self-limiting bacterial infections. Point-of-care tests (POCTs) have emerged as tools to improve the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RTIs.
This study aims to develop and test an intervention to improve the use of POCTs in managing RTIs involving GPs and CPs in Irish primary care, following the UK's Medical Research Council's (MRC) framework for complex intervention development, involving five work-packages (WPs).
WP1 involves creating best practice guidance for using POCT in managing RTIs, informed by a scoping review and validated with an expert Delphi panel. This guidance will be used to define target behaviour(s) for GPs and CPs related to POCT use. WP2 explores GP and CP perceived barriers and facilitators to these behaviours using the Theoretical Domains Framework, mapping influential domains to Behaviour Change Techniques to develop draft interventions. WP3 gathers patients' perspectives on using POCTs for RTIs. In WP4, a task group will review and finalise the intervention(s). They will consider patients' perspectives from WP3 and assess feasibility of the intervention(s). WP5 involves a proof-of-concept study to test the feasibility of the newly developed intervention(s).
A theoretically informed intervention(s) for using POCT(s) in the management of RTIs in primary care in Ireland will be developed and tested in a proof-of-concept study, following MRC guidance. Further refinement and larger studies will be needed to determine its effectiveness before widespread implementation.",,,"A theoretically informed intervention(s) for using POCT(s) in the management of RTIs in primary care in Ireland will be developed and tested in a proof-of-concept study, following MRC guidance.

It is often associated with alterations in autonomic nervous system functioning. This study examined the impact of a 10-week Baduanjin exercise program on heart rate variability and depression severity in individuals with major depressive disorder.
The present study was a two-arm, single-blind, pilot randomized controlled trial. Thirty-four participants were randomly assigned to either a Baduanjin group (n = 17) or a control group (standard care) (n = 17). The Baduanjin group participated in 60-minute sessions twice weekly while the control group were given the standard care appropriate for people with major depression disorder. Heart rate variability (HRV) and depression severity were assessed at baseline, Week 5, and Week 10.
Results showed no significant interaction effect between group and time. However, there was a group effect for ratio of low-frequency-to-high-frequency (LF/HF ratio) HRV (
These findings suggested that Baduanjin exercise may positively influence aspects of autonomic function.

Sixteen patients with CRS were enrolled in this randomized, parallel-group, controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 10 sessions of add-on MST or MECT over 4 weeks (1:1 ratio) and continued clozapine therapy during the study. Efficacy and neurocognition were assessed at baseline, 4-week and 8-week follow-up.
(1) Clinical efficacy: MST significantly improved symptoms of schizophrenia from baseline to 4 weeks, as shown in PANSS total (p = 0.009), PANSS positive (p = 0.026), PANSS negative (p = 0.031) and PANSS general psychopathology (p = 0.023); we also observed significant reductions in PANSS total (p = 0.049) and PANSS positive (p = 0.037) at 8-week follow-up. MECT group also witnessed clinical improvement from baseline to 4-week in PANSS total (p = 0.035) and PANSS positive (p = 0.001); significant reduction in PANSS positive was also observed at 8-week follow-up (p = 0.041). From baseline to 8 weeks, PANSS negative had greater reduction in MST group compared with MECT group (p = 0.042). (2) Neurocognition: Pre-and post-treatment data showed no significant cognitive adverse effects in both groups. Immediate memory is better in patients who received MST than MECT at 4-week follow-up (p = 0.030).
In this pilot study, MST and MECT equally improved positive symptoms of CRS, while MST was more effective in relieving negative symptoms.

From the time open fractures were defined ∼50 years ago, infection rates have gone essentially unchanged. Contributing factors include compromised vasculature, biofilm, and stalled innovations in treatment and prophylaxis. In this study, we engineered and tested the efficacy of a refillable drug delivery device, the Purgo Pouch (Pouch), that sustains local, high dose intrawound antibiotic concentrations in wound sites. We hypothesized that it would manage biofilm-compromised open fracture-related infection better than clinical standards of care. Therapies were tested in a unique sheep model of long bone open fracture-related infection with compromised tissue and biofilm inocula of methicillin-resistant ",,,,© 2025 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.bioflm.2025.100262

40059978,Tuberculosis Visualized With the Ultrasound Probe: A Systematic Review of Sonographic Pattern Descriptions and an Analysis of Common Sonographic Features.,"diagnosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculosis, ultrasound",Open forum infectious diseases,"Evidence on tuberculosis (TB) ultrasound patterns is scarce. We systematically reviewed the literature aiming to identify common TB ultrasound features. Sources included PubMed, Cochrane Library, and others (1 January 2000 through 30 August 2021). Any article type (retrospective, prospective, cases, trials) with verbal ultrasound descriptions of TB were included; those with <2 ultrasound features were excluded. We adapted Murad et al (2018) for quality assessment. The outcome was a descriptive frequency ranking of ultrasound features and patterns (combinations) per organ. From 388 publications, 613 ultrasound descriptions across 23 organs from 2167 individuals (465 single cases, 1702 from case series/studies) were extracted. The most commonly described sonographic patterns related to the female breast (n = 45), the liver (n = 40), and the pancreas (n = 37). The synthesis reveals sonographic TB patterns, but is constrained by limited representativeness of studies and the partly subjective analysis. Our review may serve as a clinical or research resource.

40059977,Three-Year Effectiveness of Bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide as a Switch Strategy in the Real World.,"HIV, antiretroviral treatment, bictegravir, resistance mutation, treatment experienced",Open forum infectious diseases,"We previously described the effectiveness of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) as a switch strategy in real life in people with HIV (PWH) at 48 weeks. We did not find that previous nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) had an impact on efficacy. Herein we report response rates after 3 years of follow-up.
This retrospective review comprised PWH who were treatment experienced and switched to B/F/TAF in a single-center cohort. HIV RNA <50 copies/mL was analyzed at 96 and 144 weeks in an intention-to-treat analysis (missing = failure) and per-protocol analysis; patients with missing data or changes for reasons other than virologic failure were excluded.
An overall 506 PWH were included: 16.2% were women, the median age was 52.3 years, the median time of HIV infection was 18.9 years, and 13.6% had documented preexisting NRTI RAMs. At 96 weeks of follow-up in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, HIV RNA <50 copies/mL was seen in 73.1% and 95.4%, respectively. At 144 weeks, these figures were 68.2% and 94%. There were no statistically significant differences between patients with and without previous NRTI RAMs. A total of 140 patients were excluded for the per-protocol analysis at week 144: 46 were lost to follow-up, 32 discontinued treatment due to toxicity, 34 simplified to dual antiretroviral therapy, 7 switched for other reasons, and 20 patients died (no death was B/F/TAF related).
Through 3 years of follow-up, switching to B/F/TAF maintained high rates of virologic suppression in long-term PWH.

40059912,A Review of Dietary and Lifestyle Management of Pre-Eclampsia and Postpartum Eclampsia.,"dietary supplements, eclampsia, etiology, lifestyle risk reduction, nutrition therapy",Preventive nutrition and food science,"Eclampsia is a prevailing hypertensive disorder that poses more significant risks to mothers and neonates globally. This review aimed to investigate eclampsia [preeclampsia and postpartum eclampsia (posteclampsia)] and the supportive role of dietary and lifestyle management. The review was compiled by searching various engines such as Google Scholar, Research Gate, BASE, PubMed Central, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and other related search engines. Eclampsia is believed to involve genetic and nongenetic factors, although the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Nevertheless, the traditional diagnosis of the disorder typically involves the coexistence of various factors such as an unhealthy lifestyle, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, low micronutrient levels, obesity, and proteinuria. Consuming at least 330 g fresh or 4 g dried fruits daily minimizes preeclampsia. Diets high in sugar, fat, and salt are associated with higher vulnerability to the disease. Calcium supplementation is beneficial for women as it helps to reduce the occurrence of preeclampsia. Evidence for vitamin D supplementation is inconclusive and requires further research. Selenium supplementation has shown a negative correlation with the chance of preeclampsia. Dietary patterns with higher intakes of a plant-based diet, including micronutrients, and a healthy lifestyle significantly reduce the risk of preeclampsia and posteclampsia. Furthermore, clinical trials could explore the potential benefits of dietary supplements in preventing or treating eclampsia. There is a need for further exploration into the benefits of personalized medical nutrition therapy for preeclampsia and posteclampsia. Lastly, modern prognostic tools can diagnose disorders promptly and help with effective medicinal and nutritional management.",,,,© 2025 The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.,"10.3746/pnf.2025.30.1.1

Sickle cell disease is the comprehensive term for a group of hemoglobinopathies characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S. CF is an autosomal recessive multisystemic disease with pathophysiology involving deleterious mutations in the transmembrane regulatory gene that encodes a protein that regulates the activity of chloride and sodium channels in the cell surface epithelium. NS is crucial for early diagnosis and management, which ensures a better quality of life.
To report a case of the coexistence of sickle cell anemia (SCA) and CF and perform an integrative literature review.
This is an observational study and a review of the literature focusing on two rare genetic pathologies identified simultaneously in NS from the perspective of a clinical case. The authors identified only 5 cases of SCA associated with CF. No clinical trials or review articles were identified considering the rarity of the coexistence of these two pathologies.
Herein, the authors reported the case of a girl who after undergoing NS on day 8 of life was diagnosed with SCA with an alteration in the dosage of immunoreactive trypsin. The diagnosis of CF was confirmed by the Coulometry Sweat Test. The rarity of the co-occurrence of these two severe genetic pathologies (CF and SCA) is a challenge for medical science.

In a Phase 3 placebo-controlled trial, a novel treatment using the Vibrating Capsule was recently shown to be effective in treating patients with CIC. However, its safety and tolerability has not been described in detail.
We analyzed safety data from six trials encompassing the development of the Vibrating Capsule, including, dose-ranging and pivotal studies. The incidence of adverse events, treatment discontinuation, tolerability and satisfaction were assessed.
A total of 800 patients who took either an active Vibrating Capsule or a sham/placebo (non-vibrating) but similar capsule from 6 studies were included in this post hoc analysis. The most common adverse gastrointestinal events were bloating (2.9%), abdominal pain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%) and diarrhea (1.9%). A sensation of vibration was reported by 11.7% of patients. The adverse events rates were low, and investigators categorized most of them as unrelated to treatment. There were no serious adverse events such as retention of therapeutic capsules and no patient stopped therapy or withdrew due to adverse effects. The majority of patients (83%) found the system convenient, with an overall treatment satisfaction rate of 71%.
The Vibrating Capsule, a first in class treatment for CIC was found to be safe and well tolerated by patients in clinical trials.

The albumin uses in the perioperative period has been the subject of numerous studies with a still controversial efficacy and safety profile. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of perioperative albumin use during major non-cardiac surgery.
This study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022353278). We performed an electronic search of the relevant literature from 2000 until 2023. The primary endpoint was the incidence of moderate postoperative complications (defined by a Clavien-Dindo classification grade ≥2). Secondary endpoints were intraoperative fluid balance, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative wound infection and acute kidney injury (AKI).
We identified four relevant studies involving 426 patients (213 patients in the albumin group versus 213 patients in the control group). The meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference between both group regarding the incidence of postoperative moderate complications even after subgroup analyses based on intraoperative or postoperative albumin administration (OR=1.23, 95% CI 0.73, 2.08, P=0.44). No difference was found for intraoperative fluid balance (MD=-190.83, 95% CI -408.67, 27.02, P=0.09), intraoperative blood loss (MD=-27.54, 95% CI -225.55, 170.48, P=0.79) and postoperative wound infection (OR=1.91, 95% CI 0.98, 3.73, P=0.06). Moreover, albumin administration was not associated with a significant increase of AKI incidence (OR=2.02, 95% CI 0.90, 4.53, P=0.09).

The recently approved novel pharmacotherapy trilaciclib demonstrates potential to provide multilineage protection against CIM. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of trilaciclib among patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in China.
A short-term Markov model and long-term partitioned survival model were developed to simulate disease progression during and after chemotherapy over a lifetime horizon. Clinical, cost, and utility parameters were obtained from three pivotal clinical trials of trilaciclib, published literature, and expert opinion. Total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses assessed model robustness.
The lifetime incremental cost per patient for trilaciclib was CN¥22,828 (US$3,210), with an incremental QALY of 0.093, yielding an ICER of CN¥245,841 (US$34,565) per QALY gained. This ICER falls below China's willingness-to-pay threshold of three times per-capita GDP (CN¥268,074, US$37,691). Extensive sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the base-case findings.

However, as AI utility increases, it is imperative to ensure that these models do not systematize racial and ethnic bias and further perpetuate disparities in health. This scoping review evaluates the transparency of demographic data reporting and diversity of participants included in published clinical studies utilizing AI in oncology.
We utilized PubMed to search for peer-reviewed research articles published between 2016 and 2021 with the query type ""(""deep learning"" or ""machine learning"" or ""neural network"" or ""artificial intelligence"") and (""neoplas$"" or ""cancer$"" or ""tumor$"" or ""tumour$"")."" We included clinical trials and original research studies and excluded reviews and meta-analyses. Oncology-related studies that described data sets used in training or validation of the AI models were eligible. Data regarding public reporting of patient demographics were collected, including age, sex at birth, and race. We used descriptive statistics to analyze these data across studies.
Out of 220 total studies, 118 were eligible and 47 (40%) had at least one described training or validation data set publicly available. 69 studies (58%) reported age data for patients included in training or validation sets, 60 studies (51%) reported sex, and six studies (5%) reported race.

40059376,A Spline-Based Approach to Smoothly Constrain Hazard Ratios With a View to Apply Treatment Effect Waning.,"hazard ratios, health technology assessment, splines, survival analysis, treatment efficacy waning",Statistics in medicine,"To describe and assess, via simulation, a constraint-based spline approach to implement smooth hazard ratio (HR) waning in time-to-event analyses.
A common consideration when extrapolating survival functions to evaluate the long-term performance of a novel intervention is scenarios where the beneficial effect of an intervention eventually disappears (treatment effect waning). One approach to relaxing the proportional hazards assumption for a treatment effect is to model it as a function of the timescale, with a spline function offering a flexible approach. We consider the constraint of coefficients of spline variables to 0 during estimation, leading to log-treatment effects that are constrained to 0 (HR = 1) from a given time-point: enforcing treatment efficacy waning. An example is reported. Datasets were simulated under a variety of scenarios and analyzed with treatment effect waning assumptions under various modeling choices. Bias in mean survival time difference, given fully observed waning or fully censored waning, was assessed and constrained HR estimates were visualized.
Given full waning, biases were small unless constraints directly contradicted truths. When waning was extrapolated, akin to real-life practice, biases over observed periods were minimized through the inclusion of a knot at the 95th percentile. The rate at which the HR waned slowed as the upper boundary knot/constraint was placed later, inducing less conservative treatment effect waning assumptions.
An alternative approach to modeling smooth treatment efficacy waning is demonstrated, enabling HR conditioning and marginal RMST calculation in a single framework, along with applications of the method beyond this use.",,"Given full waning, biases were small unless constraints directly contradicted truths.

Despite the tremendous success of marketed prophylactic HPV vaccines for the past 18 years, cervical cancer remains a significant global challenge. A nearly 10% increase in new cervical cancer cases worldwide from 2020 to 2022 underscores the urgent need for enhanced vaccination efforts. Current HPV vaccines, including Cervarix®, Gardasil®, Gardasil®9, Cecolin®, and Walrinvax® utilize VLP (virus-like particle) structures and have demonstrated significant efficacy. However, challenges such as type-limited coverage, cold-chain requirements, and affordability emphasize the critical need for further research and development of novel HPV vaccines. Some investigational vaccines, for instance, those using VLPs to carry protective antigens with broader coverage across different viral types, show promise for the future of cervical cancer prevention. Realizing this hope and making further progress still depend on the dedication and innovation of the scientists and authorities involved.

All 41 institutions enrolled in this study were required to report outlining that included gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (PTV), and treatment planning for one benchmark case. First, deviations in outlining were evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean distance agreement (MDA), compared to reference targets delineated by the research secretariat. Second, the participating institutions were required to create treatment plans for arms A (40.05 Gy in 15 fractions) and B (25 Gy in 5 fractions) using IMRT techniques. The quality of the outlining and dose-volume criteria for each target and organs at risk were evaluated.
Six institutions failed to adhere to the protocol and required revision due to insufficient GTV outlining, not considering anatomical barriers for CTV, and modifying PTV against protocols. Compared to the reference outlining, the means and standard deviations of DSC and MDA were 0.37 ± 0.19 and 9.41 ± 3.99 mm for GTV; 0.80 ± 0.08 and 4.31 ± 1.85 mm for CTV; and 0.83 ± 0.05 and 4.23 ± 1.45 mm for PTV, respectively. Regarding dose-volume criteria, 40 of the 41 institutions met the per-protocol limits; only one was within the acceptable limits.

40059188,Landscape of small nucleic acid therapeutics: moving from the bench to the clinic as next-generation medicines.,,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,"The ability of small nucleic acids to modulate gene expression via a range of processes has been widely explored. Compared with conventional treatments, small nucleic acid therapeutics have the potential to achieve long-lasting or even curative effects via gene editing. As a result of recent technological advances, efficient small nucleic acid delivery for therapeutic and biomedical applications has been achieved, accelerating their clinical translation. Here, we review the increasing number of small nucleic acid therapeutic classes and the most common chemical modifications and delivery platforms. We also discuss the key advances in the design, development and therapeutic application of each delivery platform. Furthermore, this review presents comprehensive profiles of currently approved small nucleic acid drugs, including 11 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), 2 aptamers and 6 siRNA drugs, summarizing their modifications, disease-specific mechanisms of action and delivery strategies. Other candidates whose clinical trial status has been recorded and updated are also discussed. We also consider strategic issues such as important safety considerations, novel vectors and hurdles for translating academic breakthroughs to the clinic. Small nucleic acid therapeutics have produced favorable results in clinical trials and have the potential to address previously ""undruggable"" targets, suggesting that they could be useful for guiding the development of additional clinical candidates.",,,,© 2025.

40059186,Comparison of MyDispense with in-person simulation in drug information training of pharmacy curriculum - a randomized cross-over study.,"Drug information, MD, MyDispense, Student response, Student success",BMC medical education,"Drug information training is restricted to pharmacy students due to the lack of opportunities for training and the inadequate number of drug information centers. Drug information simulation requires manpower and is time-consuming to arrange. MyDispense (MD) is widely accepted by numerous pharmacy schools and plays a major role in training students for various courses in the pharmacy curriculum. However, the students' performances and perceptions of MD in drug information training involving nonjudgmental queries are yet to be established.
To compare the student's success and perceptions of virtual versus in-person simulation in providing drug information.
A cross-over study design was used to compare student performance and perception of virtual and in-person simulation. A total of one hundred and forty-nine students consented to participate in the study. They were randomly allocated, with 75 assigned to the MD group and 74 to the in-person simulation group for exercise (1) Then, the students crossed over to in-person simulations and MD for exercise (2) A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire consisting of ten items was developed and validated to assess their perception regarding the learning experience of drug information exercises. Simple logistic regression was used to compare the students' success rate, and the mean value of students' responses was compared using non-parametric tests.
In exercise 1, a significant association of student success with MD was observed with task 2 (Identify the patient's background; p = 0.001) and task 3 (Identify background information of the drug information query; p = 0.002). The students expressed a significantly higher confidence level (p = 0.000) when dealing with virtual patients, as reflected in their success rate regarding the identification of the background of the patient and the nature of the drug information question during exercise 1. However, students' responses to the item related to the confidence level had no significant difference in exercise 2 (p = 0.382). Further, in-person and MDs had no significant differences regarding student perception of the remaining tasks in both exercises. Also, the student performances were comparable between virtual and in-person simulation in exercise 2.

40059172,Research prioritisation in preparedness for and response to outbreaks of high-consequence pathogens: a scoping review.,"High-consequence pathogens, Outbreaks, Preparedness, Research prioritisation, Response",BMC medicine,"Priority setting for research on epidemic/pandemic-prone pathogens is essential for the allocation of limited resources to optimise impact. It involves the identification of gaps in knowledge crucial to effective preparedness and response to outbreaks. This review maps priority-setting exercises, reviews their approaches to research prioritisation and describes associated monitoring and evaluation processes for research priorities on high-consequence pathogens.
Using search terms associated with high-consequence pathogens, as defined by the WHO (2020), EMERGE (2019), European CDC (2022) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (2021), and research prioritisation, we searched WHO Global Index Medicus; Ovid Medline; Ovid Embase; Ovid Global Health; and Scopus. Grey literature sources were Google Scholar and the WHO websites, complemented by recommendations from stakeholder consultation. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full-texts including documents describing research prioritisation activities. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis.
We identified 125 publications presenting priority setting activities on 17 high-consequence pathogens published between 1975 and 2022. Most (62%) were related to SARS-CoV-2, 5.6% to Ebola virus and 5% to Zika virus. Three different broad approaches to setting priorities were identified, most (53%) involved external consultations with experts. Few (6%) indicated plans to monitor progress against set priorities.
Our results highlight the diversity in research prioritisation practice in the context of high-consequence pathogens and a limited application of the existing standards in health research prioritisation. An increased uptake of these standards and harmonisation of practice may improve quality and confidence and ultimately improve alignment of funded research with the resulting priorities.",,"We identified 125 publications presenting priority setting activities on 17 high-consequence pathogens published between 1975 and 2022.

However, no studies have assessed patients' compliance with and understanding of post-operative instructions provided in the form of a video after tooth extraction. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of two post-extraction instruction delivery methods (conventional versus video-based instructions) on patients' understanding of and compliance with post-operative care following dental extraction.
This randomized controlled trial assessed patients who had undergone dental extraction at the dental teaching hospital at Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the conventional group (n = 68) received written instructions, and the interventional video group (n = 58) was provided with instructions delivered in a video. Patient compliance and understanding of post-operative instructions after extraction were assessed via a questionnaire after two days. The questionnaire comprised three parts: the first part collected demographic data, the second part evaluated the patient's understanding of the post-operative instructions and the third part measured the patient's compliance with the post-operative instructions via close-ended questions. The collected data were analyzed via descriptive statistics and chi-square tests.
This study involved 126 patients randomly divided into two groups: the conventional group (n = 68) and the video group (n = 58). The analysis of the questionnaires revealed no significant difference between the groups in terms of patient adherence to the post-extraction instructions.
Post-operative instruction videos are as effective as the conventional method in helping patients understand post-operative instructions after extraction.

Nineteen semi-structured one-to-one telephone or online video interviews were conducted with dentists involved in SCRiPT, using an interview guide informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Data were initially analysed deductively using a framework informed by the TDF, and subsequently using reflexive thematic analysis.
Three themes and 25 sub-themes were generated. Themes were 'comfort using selective caries removal', 'potential value of SCRiPT' and 'challenges of subjectivity'. Sub-themes included six enablers and five barriers to the use of selective caries removal, as well as five contextual factors potentially impacting dentists' decision-making. The SCRiPT trial was found to have potential value in terms of 'overcoming uncertainty', although perceived limitations were noted. The potential value of SCRiPT may depend on other factors, including the willingness of dentists to follow evidence from the trial (reflecting personal attributes and comfort with selective caries removal). The interviews also highlighted how caries removal is perceived as subjective and involves the application of clinical judgement to individual cases. General dental practitioners who are less comfortable with selective caries removal may not start to use this approach as defined within SCRiPT, particularly if there is a lack of strong evidence from the trial.
Dentists' level of comfort with selective caries removal is multi-faceted and informed by contextual factors. SCRiPT has the potential to increase acceptance of selective caries removal, but the findings may not be interpreted in this way. Future work should further explore the concept of comfort with selective caries removal, using the thematic framework outlined here to inform the design of interview topic guides.

Potential therapies targeting specific cytokines or complement proteins to limit IRI have failed in clinical trials. Monoclonal antibody 107 (mAb107), a ""pure"" (nonactivating) inhibitor of the archetypal innate immune receptor integrin CD11b, has been shown to extend the survival of IRI nonhuman primate native kidneys in an in situ model.
Here, we administered mAb107 before allograft revascularization to determine its efficacy for extending the survival of ischemia-damaged donor kidneys transplanted into major histocompatibility complex-mismatched nonhuman primate recipients.
We observed a significant delay in the onset of rejection and prolongation of allograft survival in mAb107-treated versus control recipients. Early allograft biopsies suggest this is secondary to the selective suppression of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages.
These observations support the hypothesis that inactivating CD11b with mAb107 may provide an effective strategy for prolonging the survival of ischemia-damaged allografts and increasing the successful use of marginal donor organs.",,We observed a significant delay in the onset of rejection and prolongation of allograft survival in mAb107-treated versus control recipients.

Searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed, the articles of clinical trials for COPD treated with the integration of acupuncture and medication were collected, dated from January 1, 2003 to September 1, 2023. Literature was screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using frequency statistics, the clinical advantages of the integration of acupuncture and medication were explored. The database of acupoint prescriptions was established using Microsoft Excel 2019, the complex network model was constructed using SPSS18.0 and Gephi0.10, and the core acupoints and acupoint combinations were screened.
In the analysis of the clinical advantages of the combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine for the treatment of COPD, acupuncture alone contributed to the improvement of respiratory system indicators a total of 263 times, accounting for 51.77% of the total number of improved indicators, with the majority being improvements in resting lung function (184 times, 36.22%). In addition, acupuncture alone also showed certain improvement effects on clinical symptoms, cardiac function, and biochemical blood indicators in COPD patients. The combination of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) contributed to the improvement of respiratory system indicators 90 times, accounting for 42.45% of the total improvement frequency, with the primary focus being on improvements in resting lung function (66 times, 31.13%), followed by improvements in clinical symptoms and biochemical blood indicators. The combination therapy for COPD mainly selected acupoints from the Bladder Meridian of Foot-Taiyang, with the combination of ""Shenshu (BL23) + Feishu (BL13)"" being the most frequently used acupoint pair. By performing ""k-core"" analysis and community network partitioning on the complex network diagram, three core acupoint clusters were identified.
This article categorizes the clinical advantages of acupuncture and herbal medicine combination therapy for COPD into two types:the advantages of acupuncture alone and the advantages of acupuncture combined with TCM. Both can improve the function of target organs and enhance patients' lung function. Moreover, for other non-target organ indicators, both also have an improvement effect, demonstrating the comprehensive regulatory capacity of the combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine. In the clinical acupoint selection for the treatment of COPD with the combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine, emphasis was placed on the application of specific acupoints, especially the use of confluent points. The selection is closely related to the pathogenesis of COPD, which is characterized by ""fundamental deficiency and marked excess"". By combining ""predominantly draining"" acupoints with ""predominantly tonifying"" acupoints, the therapy aims to expel pathogenic factors while supporting the body's healthy functions.",,"In the analysis of the clinical advantages of the combination of acupuncture and herbal medicine for the treatment of COPD, acupuncture alone contributed to the improvement of respiratory system indicators a total of 263 times, accounting for 51.77% of the total number of improved indicators, with the majority being improvements in resting lung function (184 times, 36.22%).

In this review, we summarize the most relevant studies in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in 2024, including the approval of first-in-class drugs for the treatment of resistant hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension, label expansions for bempedoic acid and semaglutide, and the results of major randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that have met the prespecified primary endpoints, thereby filling some gaps in knowledge and opening new perspectives in the management of CVD, and those RCTs whose results did not confirm the proposed research hypotheses. We also include a section on drug safety, where we describe the newest data on adverse reactions and drug-drug interactions that may complicate treatment and/or reduce drug adherence with the consequent decrease in drug effectiveness.

40058767,Antidepressants for low back pain and spine-related leg pain.,,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Antidepressants are commonly used to treat low back pain and spine-related leg pain. However, their benefits and harms are uncertain. This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane review of antidepressants for non-specific low back pain.
To assess the benefits and harms of antidepressants for non-specific low back pain and spine-related leg pain.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and EU Clinical Trials Register from inception to 14 November 2024.
We included randomised controlled trials that compared antidepressants with placebo, usual care, or no treatment/waiting list. Participants were 18 years of age or older with non-specific low back pain or spine-related leg pain of any duration. We excluded participants with low back pain due to spinal fracture, inflammatory disease, aortic dissection, malignancy, or infection. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability, measured at short-term follow-up (> 4 to 14 weeks post-randomisation), and total adverse events. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life.
Two review authors independently screened records to determine study inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using RoB 1 tool. Where possible, we conducted meta-analyses. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.
We included 26 randomised controlled trials. Eighteen studies included 2535 participants with non-specific low back pain, seven studies included 329 participants with spine-related leg pain, and one study included 68 participants with either condition. Most participants had pain lasting more than three months, with a mean duration between 18 months and 20 years. Mean ages ranged from 27 to 59 years. Studies evaluated serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; eight studies), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; two studies), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; 14 studies), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs; two studies), or 'other antidepressants' (two studies). All studies were placebo-controlled. Outcomes were measured at short-term follow-up in 73% of studies. All included studies had at least one domain judged at high risk of bias, with 69% at high risk of attrition bias. Non-specific low back pain (benefits) Moderate-certainty evidence demonstrated that SNRIs probably have a small effect on pain intensity (mean difference (MD) (0 to 100 scale) -5.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.17 to -3.34; I
We found that in people with non-specific low back pain, SNRIs probably have small effects on pain intensity, trivial effects on disability, and are probably associated with adverse effects. TCAs probably do not reduce low back pain intensity, but may have a small effect on disability. The effects of antidepressants on spine-related leg pain are uncertain, though SNRIs and TCAs might be prioritised over other classes for future investigations. Evidence for the safety of SSRIs, TCAs, TeCAs, and other antidepressants in non-specific low back pain and spine-related leg pain remains unclear.",,,,"Copyright © 2025 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study aimed to investigate associations between different pharmacokinetic outcomes and change in depressive symptoms following oral esketamine administration in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Understanding such associations may inform dosing and administration strategies in clinical practice.
Oral esketamine was administered twice weekly for six weeks using a titration approach in 17 patients. Esketamine and noresketamine serum levels were measured 30 min and 60 min after esketamine administration. Change in depression severity was plotted against the serum levels of esketamine and noresketamine, their sum and their ratios.
We observed high inter-individual variability in oral esketamine pharmacokinetics, and we found no association between depressive symptom change and the pharmacokinetic outcomes. The small sample size and flexible-dose regimen complicate definitive conclusions.

Currently many clinical trials in stem cells-derived EVs and secretome are in progress for an extensive variety of diseases and sometimes the results are failing. The major challenge on this roadmap is the lack of a standard extraction method for exosome, secretome and lysate. The most optimal method for obtaining the secretome of MSCs for clinical utilization involves a comprehensive approach that includes non-destructive collection methods, time optimization, multiple collection rounds, optimization of culture conditions, and quality control measures. Further research and clinical studies are warranted to validate and refine these methods for safe and effective utilization of the MSC exosome, secretome, and lysate in various clinical applications. To address these challenges, it is imperative to establish a standardized and unified methodology to ensure reliable evaluation of these extractions in clinical trials.

40058705,Sour neuronal signalling attenuates macrophage mediated liver injury.,"CCR2, Fam19a2, Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury, Macrophages, Neuroimmunity, Sour stimulation, TAFA2",Journal of hepatology,"Liver injury, a common pathophysiological basis of various liver diseases, is associated with inflammation. Hepatic nerves regulate inflammation. However, the specific signals that trigger inflammation and methods to treat inflammation by targeting nerves remain unknown.
First, we constructed an animal model to detect the effect of sour stimuli on liver ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) in mice. Next, we analyzed the altered gene expression of neurons during liver IRI by single-cell sequencing. In additional, we explored the mechanism of sour stimuli on liver IRI in mice. Finally, we designed clinical trials to explore the effect of sour stimuli on liver IRI during hepatectomy.
In this study, single-cell sequencing data from the liver and celiac ganglion showed that TAFA2 was induced in neurones during liver IRI, whereas sour stimuli decreased TAFA2 production and liver injury. In vivo studies showed that TAFA2 ablation and specific knockdown in neurones reduce liver injury. Using FLAG-tagged TAFA2, we found that TAFA2 interacted with Chemokine C-C-Motif Receptor 2 (CCR2) and promoted macrophage activation, consistent with RNA sequencing data showing that TAFA2 induced the expression of inflammatory genes in wild-type macrophages, but not in CCR2 knockout macrophages. Moreover, patients exposed to sour stimuli exhibited less severe liver IRI during hepatectomy.
Our results reveal a neuroimmune interaction in which neurones derived TAFA2 recruit CCR2+ macrophages to the liver and trigger liver injury, which is at least partly reduced by sour stimuli nerve signalling, which is related to acid with low pH. Our findings provide new insights into the brain-liver axis and therapeutic perspectives for liver injury.
This clinical trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2400088096) IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: ● This study clarified that sour stimuli, which is related to acid (low pH value), is at least partly responsible for reducing human and mouse liver ischemia and reperfusion injury through nerves, and confirmed the important role of brain-liver axis in liver ischemia and reperfusion injury.● This study found that brain-liver axis to increase liver ischemia-reperfusion injury through the secretion of TAFA2 protein, and proved that TAFA2 protein mediated liver ischemia-reperfusion injury through the recruitment and activation of macrophages.● This study found that CCR2 is the receptor for TAFA2 protein, and TAFA2 and CCL2 produce a different transcriptional profile by RNA sequencing.",,"In this study, single-cell sequencing data from the liver and celiac ganglion showed that TAFA2 was induced in neurones during liver IRI, whereas sour stimuli decreased TAFA2 production and liver injury.

40058682,Spatiotemporal activation of lumbar sensorimotor networks.,"Cord dorsum potentials, Epidural spinal stimulation, Neuromodulation, Peripheral nerve stimulation, Porcine model, Spinal cord, Spinally evoked motor potentials",Experimental neurology,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) research is primarily conducted using rodent models, which has resulted in significant advances, including novel treatment strategies that promote recovery. Unfortunately, many of these treatments do not have the same efficacy once translated to human clinical trials. Large animal models, such as Yucatan miniature pigs (minipigs), may provide a superior alternative to translating findings to human clinical trials due to their anatomical similarities to humans. However, porcine models are not widely used, which may be due in part to our inadequate understanding of the functional architecture of neural networks in the minipig spinal cord. This study utilized a clinical-grade epidural paddle array implanted over the lumbosacral enlargement of four minipigs. We then mapped the topographical distribution of spinally evoked motor potentials recorded in hindlimb muscles and cord dorsum potentials evoked by sub-motor threshold tibial nerve stimulation. Spatial correlation analysis suggests the motor networks and sensory networks innervated by the tibial nerve are distinct and separate within the minipig lumbosacral spinal cord. Our findings provide foundational knowledge on sensorimotor networks that are functionally diffused among the lumbar enlargement and possess distinct spatiotemporal patterns of activation along the cord for control of motor output and the processing of sensory input. The results reveal critical insights about the variability of electrophysiological measures across animals, offering a foundation for more individualized approaches in future studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an epidural paddle array to map motor responses is a clinically feasible method, though our results highlight the subject-specific nature of these maps and their sensitivity to paddle location and orientation.",,,,Copyright © 2025.

In recent years there have been multiple advances and changes in the management of psoriatic patients that justify a review and update of the use of topical therapy. Experts from the Spanish Psoriasis Working Group (GPS) of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology Venereology (AEDV) have developed a set of recommendations for the treatment of psoriasis based on the best available evidence and experts' opinion. Methodology: We followed the methodology of nominal groups, with the help from a systematic review. A coordinator was designated, and a group of experts was selected based on their experience and knowledge on topical therapies for the management of psoriasis. Afterwards, the objectives and key points of the document were defined and agreed upon, and with help from a documentary specialist, a systematic review was conducted across Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, as well as observational studies were selected. Published clinical practice guidelines and related documents were also reviewed. With this information, the coordinator generated a series of recommendations that would be later evaluated and modified by the experts themselves. After several review processes and an external evaluation, the final document was drafted. Results: Practical recommendations on the use of topical therapies for the management of psoriasis are presented in line with other documents of the AEDV, including the use of topical treatment as the main therapy, their adjuvant role when using systemic therapies, treatment selection, treatment strategies, their use in special locations and severe psoriasis, and the patients adherence and preferences to the topical therapy.

However, adverse outcomes primarily due to histocompatibility differences between the donor and the patient are still of concern. Progress in genetic and molecular mechanisms, as well as new technology to insert DNA sequences in cell genomes has allowed the development of strategies to treat genetic diseases by correcting the gene defect in patients' cells. This technology is named gene therapy. Gene therapy approaches being developed for IEI are mediated by gene insertion, using a retroviral vector, or by gene editing, using a combination of a nuclease and a DNA template. After the unexpected occurrence of oncogenesis associated with the initial retroviral vector designs, significant advances have led to successful gene therapy clinical trials for three forms of SCID, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach.

Reviews on cancer,"The use of platinum-based drugs in cancer treatment is one of the most common methods in chemotherapy. Especially, cisplatin induces cell death by interrupting DNA synthesis by binding to the DNA bases, thereby leading to the apoptosis via multiple pathways. However, the major hurdle in chemotherapy is drug resistance. To overcome drug resistance, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target. The UPS is a pivotal signaling pathway that regulates the majority of cellular proteins by attaching ubiquitin to substrates, leading to proteasomal degradation. Conversely, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove tagged ubiquitin from the substrate and inhibit degradation, thereby maintaining proteostasis. Recently, studies have been conducted to identify the substrates of DUBs and investigated the cellular mechanisms, and now the development of therapeutics using DUB inhibitors is in clinical trials. However, the mechanism of the DUB response to cisplatin remains still unclear. In this review, we summarize the research reported on the function of DUBs responding to cisplatin.",,,,Copyright © 2024.

Reviews on cancer,"Gastric cancer, a globally prevalent malignant tumor, is characterized by low early diagnosis rate, high metastasis rate, and poor prognosis, particularly in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recognized as the primary risk factor for gastric cancer. However, the fact that fewer than 3 % of infected individuals develop cancer suggests that other bacteria may also influence gastric carcinogenesis. A diverse community of microorganisms may interact with H. pylori, thereby driving disease progression. Here, the role of the cytokine IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family, is scrutinized. Its production can be induced by H. pylori through the activation of specific signaling pathways, and it contributes to the inflammatory environment by promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This article reviews the conflicting evidence regarding IL-33's role in the progression from gastritis to gastric cancer and discusses the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the IL-33/ST2 axis, with various antibodies and inhibitors in development or undergoing clinical trials for inflammatory diseases. However, the role of IL-33 in gastric cancer treatment remains to be fully elucidated, with its effects potentially dependent on the cellular context and stage of cancer progression. In summary, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate relationship between gastric microbiota, IL-33, and gastritis - gastric cancer transition, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets and the development of novel treatment strategies.",,,,Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

Both the US FDA and ASCO advocate for consistent integration of Quality of Life (QoL) and Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO). This study evaluates the extent to which recent Phase III lung cancer trials incorporate QoL, highlighting implications for global cancer policy and research priorities.
This systematic review analyzed PubMed for Phase III lung cancer clinical trials involving anticancer drugs conducted between 2019 and 2023. The study assessed if QoL was included as an endpoint. Subgroup analyses categorized trials by cancer subtype (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], small cell lung cancer [SCLC]). Analyses were also stratified by publication year to explore potential temporal trends. Subanalyses included impact factor categories (≥10 and <10) and differentiation between superiority and noninferiority trials.
191 Phase III lung cancer clinical trials published between 2019 and 2023, meeting the criteria were included in this study. QoL was included in 31.93% of trials across all subtypes, 33.72% of NSCLC trials incorporated QoL vs 19.04% of SCLC trials included QoL. Our analysis reveals a significant shortfall in incorporating quality of life (QoL) as an endpoint, highlighting a crucial gap in evaluating the comprehensive impact of interventions.
The limited integration of QoL assessments in lung cancer trials underscores a missed opportunity to inform patient-centered care and highlights disparities across cancer subtypes.

In this study, the advanced aptasensing interface has been constructed using a novel nanocomposite as a biocompatible scaffold to anchor Apt strings specific to DIG on the surface under a green methodology. The high-performance nanocomposite consisting of the rice husk (RH)-derived nanosilica and pseudo-gold nanobones (pseudo-AuNBs@RH-derived nanosilica) has been utilized for aptasensor fabrication. Each modification step of the surface has been characterized by the signal change of the ferro/ferri cyanide as the electrochemical probe. The molecular dynamic (MD) computational method has been applied to simulate a visual interaction of Apt with DIG through a conformation-switching assay format from a molecular view to validate DIG binding to Apt. The resulting aptasensor is able to measure DIG quantitatively from 100 fM to 0.85 μM with a limit of detection (LOD) value of 33.33 fM. The satisfactory results with a minimum nonspecific adsorption effect of the aptasensor in analyzing some real samples of human blood serum, saliva and urine containing DIG not only promise DIG diagnosis in real clinical trials but also pave the way for its non-invasive measurement. The greenness of the applied strategy has been evaluated with a high score according to two international metrics, which is another achievement of this study. The synthesis of porous nanosilica from RH waste as value-added nanomaterials with outstanding features not only decreases the amount of unused RH waste piled up in nature but also, manages the synthesis costs that may be a path-breaker for more investigations.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

40058137,Use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with lung cancer and multiple sclerosis.,"Immunotherapy, Multiple sclerosis, Non-small cell lung cancer","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes 80-85% of lung cancer cases and is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Most patients are diagnosed at metastatic stages, where curative treatment is rarely an option and the primary goal is to prolong survival while maintaining quality of life. Since NSCLC is often diagnosed in elderly individuals, comorbidities must also be considered in the treatment planning. Immune evasion is a central hallmark of cancer. By interactions between immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), tumors downregulate immune responses, promoting self-tolerance and evading detection. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) enhance the autoimmune function against cancer cells by blocking these targets and have wide evidence of efficacy in NSCLC. Currently, ICIs combined with chemotherapy are the standard of care for metastatic NSCLC without actionable mutations. In tumors with high PD-L1 expression, ICI monotherapy is also an effective option. In some cases, treatment associated toxicities and co-existing morbidities remain a challenge. In the case of patients with autoimmune disorders, they may experience exacerbation of the underlying autoimmune disease following ICI initiation and also an increased risk of immune-related adverse effects (irAE). People with underlying multiple sclerosis (MS) have mostly been excluded from clinical trials of ICIs, so data on their safety in the setting of MS is limited.

40057939,Computational modelling of a multiepitope vaccine targeting glycoprotein-D for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2): an immunoinformatic analysis.,"Epitope-based vaccines, Glycoprotein-D, Herpes simplex virus, Molecular dynamics simulations, Reverse vaccinology",Molecular diversity,"Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) infection is a global concern, affecting around 500 million individuals worldwide and being the leading cause of genital ulcers. Although several HSV vaccine candidates have been tested in humans, as of right now, neither HSV type has a licenced vaccination available. This study utilized reverse vaccinology to conduct an extensive analysis of the entire genome of HSV-2 where glycoprotein-D was chosen for T-cell epitope predictions. Through an immunoinformatic approach, we identified 2 novel CD8 + and 8 CD4 + T-cell epitopes overlapped within conformational B-cell epitopes, which hold promise as potent vaccine candidates. These epitopes were highly immunogenic and non-toxic, and also showed significant population coverage all over the world. Notably, the predicted epitopes demonstrated cross-reactivity with HSV-1, with the majority exhibiting over 80% conservation within glycoprotein-D. In addition, the designed vaccines' physicochemical properties revealed that these vaccines are non-toxic and non-allergenic, exhibited highly antigenic properties and had the potential to interact with immune receptors effectively. Furthermore, molecular docking studies with human immune receptors, specifically TLR2, demonstrated robust interactions, supported by molecular dynamics simulations indicating stable binding and dynamics. Finally, via codon optimization and in silico cloning, the vaccine candidates were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, demonstrating feasibility for large-scale production. Computational immune response modelling following varied dosages suggested that the immunogenic constructs could elicit significant immune responses. In conclusion, this study presents promising vaccine candidates against HSV-2, utilizing a rational design approach. However, experimental validation is necessary before advancing to clinical trials.",,,,"© 2025. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","10.1007/s11030-025-11148-z

40057936,Retrospective analysis of treatment discontinuation in minimal residual disease negative multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma, Treatment-free interval",International journal of hematology,"The prognostic significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in multiple myeloma (MM) is well-established, and MRD negativity serves as a surrogate marker for treatment outcomes. However, in various clinical trials, achieving MRD negativity often leads to treatment continuation until disease progression. In real-world clinical practice, discontinuing treatment could lower healthcare costs and reduce adverse events.
We retrospectively analyzed patients who reached MRD negativity and discontinued treatment.
A total of 39 multiple MM cases were included (17 eligible and 22 ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation). The median time to next treatment was 42.4 months. Ten patients (25%) required additional treatment due to paraproteins or clinical relapse. Cumulative incidence of relapse at 12 and 48 months was 11.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-28.2%) and 26.4% (95% CI, 12.8-49.6%), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at first visit and t(4;14) were the only baseline factors significantly associated with worse outcomes. Eight patients (20%) with International Staging System (ISS) = I and with no risk factors (history of extramural disease, elevated LDH, high-risk cytogenetics) had no recurrence.
Although treatment discontinuation in high-risk cases is potentially unsafe, low-risk cases demonstrate potential for treatment-free remission.",,"A total of 39 multiple MM cases were included (17 eligible and 22 ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation).

40057874,Population-Based Incidence of Infectious Mononucleosis and Related Hospitalizations: 2010 Through 2021.,,Mayo Clinic proceedings,"To determine whether the risks of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and serious IM outcomes are changing over time.
Individuals with a diagnosis of IM and hospitalizations due to IM were identified among persons residing in an Upper Midwest region between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2021, using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Infectious mononucleosis rates were calculated assuming the entire population between 2010 and 2021 was at risk, and IM-associated hospitalization rates were calculated among everyone with a diagnosis of IM. Poisson regression was used to test trends and estimate incidence and hospitalization rate ratios.
We identified 5334 individuals with IM; the overall IM rate was 60.60 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 58.98 to 62.25). Rates were highest in females, individuals of White race, those with non-Hispanic ethnicity, and individuals 15 to 19 years old (all P<.05). Infectious mononucleosis rates decreased significantly over time among all age groups (all tests for trend, P<.05). Overall, 234 individuals (4.3%) were hospitalized with IM (43.87 per 1000 persons with IM; 95% CI, 38.43 to 49.87), and hospitalization rates among those with IM increased over time (test for trend, P<.05). Individuals younger than 10 years, those 20 years or older, and individuals of Hispanic ethnicity had increased risk for IM-associated hospitalization (all adjusted P<.05).

Current oral antiviral agents effectively suppress viral replication but fail to eliminate the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Recent advances in immunomodulatory therapies offer new hope for improving functional cure rates.
This special report discusses the latest therapeutic strategies targeting immune responses in CHB. We list the mechanisms of immune evasion in HBV infection and highlight emerging immunomodulatory agents. Key findings from recent clinical trials and critical considerations are summarized to provide an overview of ongoing efforts and future direction to achieve functional cure.
While combination therapies hold promise, their real-world feasibility depends on patient selection, combination regimens, costs, and global accessibility. A successful HBV cure strategy must integrate scientific innovation with public health policies to ensure equitable access to effective treatments.

40057834,"Clinical characterisation, treatment outcomes, and case fatality risk of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh.",,Journal of global health,"Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves.
We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves.
Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99).
Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",,"Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants.

40057833,Improved Graft Function and Decreased Post-transplantation Urinary Tract Infection after Azithromycin Dosing to Donors: A Pilot Study.,,Urology journal,"The rising trend of End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients requiring dialysis or transplantation needs a more therapeutic plan. As the best strategy for ESRD patients, kidney transplantation still needs outcome improvement. Macrolide drugs display antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in chronic disease and intraoperatively and can concentrate in tissues for extended periods. Hence, theoretically, the drug prescription to the donor and accumulation in the kidney can cause graft immunomodulation and improve kidney transplantation outcomes.
This double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on 62 eligible kidney donors randomly allocated to the azithromycin or placebo group and treated with a single dose (one gram) one day before surgery. The primary outcome was kidney graft function, and secondary outcomes included rejection rate, urinary tract infections in graft recipients, pain and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in live donors, and complications in donors and recipients. Outcomes were measured at baseline and every day in the first week after transplantation in both live donors and recipients and 30 and 90 days after transplantation. The adverse events were recorded as well.
The mean age was 39 (SD, 13) years; 40% were women, and 11.6% were diabetic. Mean creatinine was 6.11 mL/min/1.73m2. Most patients in both arms were male (61.3%) and in early middle age. Hypertension was the most common cause of ESRD. Azithromycin could reduce the rejection rate in the first few days after kidney transplantation. Inflammatory mediators were lower in the azithromycin group, and fewer cases of urinary tract infection were found in the azithromycin group (p < 0.05).

However, recent randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses involving patients with normal anatomy and large renal stones have shown that laparoscopic pyelolithotomy (LPL) has a higher success rate and lower complication rates compared to the gold standard, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Furthermore, stone recurrence appears to be lower following LPL compared to PCNL.

Focus has shifted towards using immunotherapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, to selectively target tumor antigens and mediate cytotoxic activity within an otherwise immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Between 2015-2024, the results of eight completed and two ongoing phase I clinical trials have been published. The majority of studies have treated recurrent GBM patients, although the inter- and intra-patient tumor heterogeneity has been historically challenging to overcome. Molecular targets have included EGFR, HER2, and IL13Rα2 and there has been continued development in improving receptor constructs, identifying novel targets, and adding adjuvant enhancers to increase efficacy. CAR T cells have been safely administered through both peripheral and locoregional routes but with variable clinical and radiographic efficacy. Most trials utilized autologous T cell products to avoid immune rejection yet were unable to consistently show robust engraftment and persistence within patients.

In China, tens of millions of patients experience diarrhea every year after cholecystectomy, which results in long-term pain in patients. Traditional Chinese medicine is a national treasure and has made great contributions to human health throughout the long history of the Chinese nation. However, as a classic ready-for-use traditional Chinese medicine, the exact clinical efficacy of the Xianglian preparation needs further observation. This article presents the protocol of a single-center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Xianglian capsules in patients with diarrhea after cholecystectomy.
This study was conducted in the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, following the recommendations of the current SPIRIT and CONSORT statements. We will recruit 90 patients who have developed diarrhea after cholecystectomy and randomize them 1:1 into the observation and control groups. The control group was given starch placebo capsules, and the observation group was given Xianglian capsules. Patient diarrhea-related indicators were collected at baseline and 5 days postdose. We will also collect patients' intestinal inflammation-related indicators and fecal microbial samples to analyze the possible mechanism of action of drugs.
This study will clarify the clinical effects of the Xianglian preparation on patients with diarrhea after cholecystectomy, provide evidence-based evidence, and promote the development and application of this classic prescription.

40057748,The effectiveness of web-based grief intervention for adults who lost a loved one: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Grief, Meta-analysis, Online intervention, Systematic review, Web-based",BMC palliative care,"Many bereaved individuals suffer from intense grief, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. To prevent these conditions from worsening, web-based grief interventions have emerged as a promising solution for providing accessible, flexible, and anonymous support to bereaved individuals. However, two previous meta-analyses focused only on the post-intervention effects of web-based grief interventions on grief, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression in bereavement individuals, relying on a small number of studies published before 2021. Therefore, after including new research, the present study evaluated the effects of web-based grief interventions on grief, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder in bereaved adults, both post-intervention and after three months of follow-up.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES, Embase, CINAHL, Medline, and Clinical Trials, with a search time range from database establishment to February 1, 2024, without language limitations. The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool, and evaluation was conducted using Review Manager 5.3. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42024506293.
A total of 726 and 771 participants were in the intervention and control groups, respectively. After the implementation of the web-based grief intervention, significant improvements were observed in anxiety (standard mean difference [SMD] = -0.37, 95% CI [-0.54, -0.20] p < 0.0001), posttraumatic stress disorder (SMD = -0.64, 95% CI [-0.78, -0.50], p < 0.00001), depression (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI [-0.47, -0.27], p < 0.00001), and grief (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.40, -0.19], p < 0.00001) among the bereaved individuals. In the intervention group, after three months of follow-up, significant improvements continued in grief (SMD = -0.19, 95% CI [-0.31, -0.08], p = 0.001), depression (SMD = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.04], p = 0.009) and posttraumatic stress disorder (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.01], p = 0.04), whereas no significant improvement was observed in anxiety (SMD = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.22, 0.19], p = 0.86).
Web-based grief interventions have a positive and promising effect on anxiety, depression, grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder in bereaved individuals following the intervention.

For our 20-week intervention study, 65 participants with moderate elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; ≥ 3 mmol/l) and without lipid-lowering therapy were recruited. The intervention to improve nutritional behavior was based on individualized menu plans which were characterized by defined energy and nutrient intake. To improve compliance, individual nutritional counselling sessions were held every two weeks. In addition to motivation, cooking skills were strengthened and nutritional knowledge was imparted. Follow-up visits were carried out after 10 and 20 weeks.
The MoKaRi diet lowered the concentrations of total cholesterol (menu plan group (MP): -15%; menu plan plus fish oil group (MP-FO): -11%), LDL-C (MP: -14%; MP-FO: -16%) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MP: -16%; MP-FO: -13%) (p < 0.001).

We aimed to identify the alterations in echocardiographic variables and circulating biomarkers associated with DM, CAD, or both and to assess the effect of spironolactone on them.
The ""Heart OMics in AGEing"" (HOMAGE) trial evaluated the effect of spironolactone on circulating markers of fibrosis over 9 months of follow-up in people at risk for HF. From the initial population (N = 527) of the HOMAGE trial, a total of 495 participants (mean age 74 years, 25% women) were categorized according to clinical phenotype (DM-/CAD + vs. DM+/CAD- vs. DM+/CAD+), while the DM-/CAD- group was excluded due to the low sample size (N = 32). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relations between variables and DM/CAD status.
At baseline, participants with DM, whether or not they had CAD, showed lower markers of type I collagen synthesis (procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide; β [95% CI]: DM+/CAD-: -6.973 [-13.778; -0.167]; DM+/CAD+: -9.039 [-15.174; -2.903]), reduced left ventricular volumes (β [95% CI]: end-diastolic, DM+/CAD-: -6.323 [-9.696; -2.951]; DM+/CAD+: -2.503 [-5.531; 0.526]; end-systolic, DM+/CAD-: -2.905 [-4.817; -0.992]; DM+/CAD+: -1.400 [-3.120; 0.320]) and higher levels of galectin-3 (Exponential β [95% CI]: DM+/CAD-: 1.127 [1.050; 1.209]; DM+/CAD+: 1.118 [1.048; 1.192]), and growth differentiation factor-15 (Exponential β [95% CI]: DM+/CAD-: 1.542 [1.360; 1.747]; DM+/CAD+: 1.535 [1.370; 1.720]), along with an elevated E/e' ratio (β [95% CI]: DM+/CAD-: 1.355 [0.462; 2.248]; DM+/CAD+: 0.879 [0.067; 1.690]), compared with DM-/CAD + individuals (all p < 0.05). At follow-up, the effect of spironolactone on echocardiographic variables and circulating biomarkers was not significantly different across DM/CAD phenotypes (all p-interaction > 0.05), except for a more pronounced reduction in GDF-15 in the DM+/CAD + group at the 1-month visit (p-interaction = 0.03).

Physical activity during pregnancy can lower the odds ratio of developing GDM and offer numerous health benefits for mothers and infants. However, the prevalence of physical inactivity among pregnant women worldwide is high. The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) can be used to develop interventions to enhance physical activity. However, no research has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity interventions among Chinese pregnant women using the BCW framework.
We will conduct a single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial at a maternal-child health care center. A total of 244 pregnant women at high risk for GDM will be randomly allocated to either a study group receiving a physical activity counseling intervention or a control group receiving standard care. The intervention will comprise one face-to-face individual counseling session combined with three weekly online group counseling sessions based on Motivational Interviewing, supplemented by four biweekly counseling before 24 gestation weeks, and WeChat group support (Tencent, Shenzhen, China). Educational materials will also be available on the WeChat Official Account. The program will begin before 12

In recent years, it has become clear that ultrasonography is more accurate than palpation for identifying the cricothyroid membrane. However, it is unclear how ultrasound should be administered. We investigated whether real-time or static ultrasound techniques were more useful for needle cricothyrotomy in patients with simulated anatomical abnormalities of the neck. Three cervical simulators with anatomical abnormalities were created. After education and hands-on training in needle cricothyroidotomy, 48 participants (27 junior residents, 12 anesthesia residents, and nine anesthesiologists) performed needle cricothyroidotomy using either a real-time or static ultrasound technique (crossover study). Fisher's exact test was used to assess the success rate and accuracy of the puncture (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). The success rate of cricothyrotomy puncture was significantly higher with the real-time ultrasound technique than with the static ultrasound technique. The real-time ultrasound technique led to significantly higher puncture accuracy and shorter procedure time than the static ultrasound technique. Needle cricothyroidotomy using real-time ultrasonography may be more useful than that using static ultrasonography.",,,,© 2025.

Specifically, it evaluates changes measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) after six months compared to a control group receiving standard care. A longitudinal, controlled experiment was conducted with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The experimental group underwent three weekly interventions of 45-50 min over eight months in 2021. Cognitive functions were periodically assessed using ACE-R. Power analysis determined a sample size of 128 participants for adequate statistical power; the study included 60 participants (30 per group). Data were analyzed using non-parametric methods due to non-normal data distribution. The experimental group showed significant improvement in ACE-R scores compared to the control group. The mean difference in scores was 10.27 points (SD = 2.83) for the experimental group, indicating improved cognitive function, while the control group showed a mean decrease of 5.67 points (SD = 2.06). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between groups at both interim and final assessments (p < 0.001). The combined special education and occupational therapy intervention led to significant cognitive improvements in Alzheimer's patients compared to standard care. The study supports the efficacy of such interventions in enhancing cognitive functions, as evidenced by the substantial score increases in the experimental group.",,,,© 2025.

Sixty-four adults (30 male, 34 female) with a previously endodontically treated tooth and a large periapical lesion were randomized into four groups (n = 16): retrograde obturation (RG), orthograde obturation (OG), RG + L-PRF, and OG + L-PRF. All participants underwent root canal retreatment in two sessions. The RG group underwent root-end resection and retrograde MTA obturation, the RG + L-PRF group underwent L-PRF application to the bone defect following the RG protocol, the OG group underwent orthograde MTA obturation and periapical curettage without root-end resection, and the OG + L-PRF group underwent L-PRF application following the OG protocol. Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed preoperatively, and at 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. At follow-up visits, pain scores, swelling, tooth mobility, tenderness to percussion (T-PER), tenderness to palpation (T-PAL), and the presence of fistula were clinically assessed. Periapical radiography determined the periapical index (PAI) score and measured the periapical lesion area (PALA). The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to test the effect of a single independent variable (factor) on a dependent variable. No statistically significant differences were identified between the groups for preoperative PAI scores, pain scores, swelling, tooth mobility, fistula, T-PER, or T-PAL (p > 0.05). At postoperative week 1, the RG + L-PRF group showed a significantly lower T-PER. The RG + L-PRF group showed significantly lower PALA values and significantly higher PALA healing rates at postoperative 1, 6, and 9 months. Both L-PRF groups achieved PALA healing rates of over 90% at 9 months. It was concluded that a combination of apicoectomy and L-PRF effectively treats periapical lesions and promotes both short- and long-term healing and that a combination of periapical curettage and L-PRF offers a less invasive alternative, especially when the crown-to-root ratio is a concern.Trial registration: The protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05847647).",,,,© 2025.

40057574,Chimeric Ad5/35 oncolytic adenovirus overcome preexisting neutralizing antibodies and enhance tumor targeting efficiency.,,Cancer gene therapy,"KD01, a third-generation conditionally replicating adenovirus serotype 5 developed by our team, has approved by the China Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) for Phase I clinical trials (NCT06552598). However, 60% seroprevalence of anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies is a major hurdle for Ad5-based oncolytic viruses. To address this issue, we developed oAd5/35-HF, a fourth-generation oncolytic adenovirus vector designed to enhance infection efficiency and evade pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NABs). To achieve this, we introduced targeted capsid modifications, replacing hexon hypervariable regions (HVRs) 1 and 5 with those from adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35), along with alterations to the fiber region. These combined modifications significantly improved infection efficiency, maintained high viral titers, and enabled the virus to resist NABs. This is the first report of replacing both the Ad5 hexon HVRs and fiber regions with those from Ad35 in an oncolytic adenovirus, resulting in potent antitumor activity across multiple cancer types, even in the presence of high NAB levels. The oAd5/35-HF backbone provides a versatile platform for developing new chimera oncolytic adenovirus and adenovirus vector-based vaccine.",,,,"© 2025.

40057571,"A randomised, double-blind clinical study into the effect of zinc citrate trihydrate toothpaste on oral plaque microbiome ecology and function.",,Scientific reports,"The oral microbiome is a diverse community of microbes residing on all oral surfaces. A balanced oral microbiome is associated with good oral health, and disruption can result in imbalance associated with diseases including gingivitis and dental caries. It is important, therefore, to understand how daily use of oral hygiene products impacts the microbiome. Composition and activity of dental plaque microbiome from 115 participants was analysed after brushing with one of two toothpastes, one containing zinc citrate trihydrate and the other a control toothpaste, in a parallel design. Each participant brushed twice daily for 6-weeks, with samples collected at baseline, 2 and 6-weeks. Metataxonomic analysis demonstrated changes in bacterial communities with use of the zinc toothpaste compared to the control product at community and species level. Increases at the species level were observed for taxa from the genus Veillonella with decrease in a taxon from the genus Fusobacterium for the zinc toothpaste. Analysis of microbiome function based on predicted metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis show that use of the zinc toothpaste is associated with an in-vivo reduction in glycolysis, consistent with the mode of action of zinc and, increases in processes linked to gum-health (lysine biosynthesis), and to whole-body health (nitrate reduction). Our findings provide the first understanding of the beneficial modulation of microbiome composition and function by zinc-containing toothpaste in-vivo for oral care benefits.",,,,© 2025.

40057479,Power-free knee rehabilitation robot for home-based isokinetic training.,,Nature communications,"Robot-assisted isokinetic training has been widely adopted for knee rehabilitation. However, existing rehabilitation facilities are often heavy, bulky, and extremely energy-consuming, which limits the rehabilitation opportunities only at designated hospitals. In this study, we introduce a highly integrated and lightweight (52 kg) knee rehabilitation robot that can provide home-based isokinetic training without external power. By integrating a motor, torque/angle sensors, control circuit, and energy regeneration circuit into a single driver module, our robot can provide power-free isokinetic training by recycling mechanical work from the trainee. Ten postsurgical subjects were involved in an interventional randomized trial (ChiCTR2300076715, Part I) and the cross-sectional area of trained legs (experimental group) was significantly higher than that of untrained legs (control group). The primary outcomes, muscle growth (quadriceps: 5.93%, hamstrings: 10.27%) and strength improvements (quadriceps: 70%, hamstrings: 84%), achieved with our robots surpass those of existing commercial rehabilitation devices. These findings indicate that our robot presents a viable option for home-based knee rehabilitation, significantly enhancing the accessibility of effective treatment.",,,,© 2025.

The appeal of CDS has always seemed intuitive and is based, in part, on preclinical investigations implicating pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation as causing motor fluctuations and dyskinesia from levodopa (LD) treatment. However, four large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials testing infused drug delivery have demonstrated only partial effectiveness of CDS at reducing daily OFF time. Other clinical trial data has offered evidence that a reduction in OFF time also can be accomplished from targeting sites in motor pathways downstream from the basal ganglia. Neural plasticity and a CNS calcium receptor signaling compound, ophthalmate, may also hold answers to the regulation of OFF time. Finally, insights derived from neural computational modeling of PD motor pathway pharmacology and the involved electrophysiological connections may guide future understanding of motor fluctuations in PD and their management.",,,,Copyright © 2025.

Treatments targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), key pain mediators, often fail in clinical trials for unknown reasons. Here, we discuss the recent evidence that GPCRs and RTKs generate sustained signals from multiprotein signaling complexes or signalosomes in intracellular compartments to control chronic pain. We evaluate the evidence that selective antagonism of these intracellular signals provides more efficacious and long-lasting pain relief than antagonism of receptors at the surface of cells. We highlight how the identification of coreceptors and molecular scaffolds that underpin pain signaling by multiple receptors has identified new therapeutic targets for chronic pain, surmounting the redundancy of the pain signaling pathway.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review we focus on NENs of the gynecological system emphasizing the classification, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NENs across the gynecological tract (cervix, endometrium, ovary, vagina, and vulva), risk/prognostic factors, pathology and molecular biology (including actionable genomic mutations), imaging, staging and the most effective treatment modalities in the ""standard of care"" approach as well as the pipeline products. We also focused on metastatic spreading patterns of gynecological NENs. We searched for all available literature reviews, interventional studies, short series, case reports and meta-analyses published from 1990 to 2024. Deteriorated survival rate is essentially impacted by early development of lymph node, distant organ metastases and vascular propagation toward rapid extra-pelvic metastasis to the brain, liver, lung, bone marrow, lymph nodes and bones. Management of NENs needs to be customized on a case-based manner and comprises a multidisciplinary approach that involves gynecologists, surgeons, medical oncologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine specialists, pathologists, molecular biologists, qualified nurses etc. The treatment of extrapulmonary NENs arising in the female genital tract is basically extrapolated from that for small cell lung cancer. This includes, but is not limited to: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, somatostatin analogs, and immunotherapy as well as investigational drugs in rare prospective clinical trials.

40057343,"Ivonescimab versus pembrolizumab for PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (HARMONi-2): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study in China.",,"Lancet (London, England)","Ivonescimab is a bispecific antibody against programmed cell death protein 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, yielding promising clinical outcomes for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in early-phase studies. We compared the efficacy and safety of ivonescimab with pembrolizumab in patients with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
HARMONi-2 is a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial across 55 hospitals in China. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer without sensitising epidermal growth factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocations and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 20 mg/kg ivonescimab or 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by histology, clinical stage, and PD-L1 expression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a masked independent radiographic review committee per RECIST v1.1 in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05499390; recruitment is complete, with the trial ongoing and final analysis to be reported later.
Between Nov 9, 2022, and Aug 26, 2023, 398 (45%) of 879 screened patients were randomly assigned to receive ivonescimab (n=198) or pembrolizumab (n=200). At the preplanned interim analysis, median PFS was significantly longer with ivonescimab than with pembrolizumab (11·1 vs 5·8 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·51 [95% CI 0·38-0·69]; one-sided p<0·0001). The PFS benefit of ivonescimab over pembrolizumab was broadly consistent within prespecified subgroups, including patients with PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) 1-49% (HR 0·54 [95% CI 0·37-0·78]) and PD-L1 TPS of 50% of higher (HR 0·48 [0·29-0·79]). Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58 (29%) patients with ivonescimab and 31 (16%) patients with pembrolizumab. Immune-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed in 14 (7%) of 197 patients on ivonescimab and 16 (8%) of 199 patients on pembrolizumab. Ivonescimab demonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with both squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were comparable between the two groups.
Ivonescimab significantly improved PFS compared with pembrolizumab in previously untreated patients with advanced PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, ivonescimab might represent another treatment option in the first-line setting for PD-L1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Outcome data were set to missing and multiple imputation was used to replace values affected by COVID-19.
The trial randomised 253 participants, 187 participants had an SFS score at 12 months, 75 of those were collected during COVID-19 restrictions. In the original complete case regression analysis, targeting a treatment policy estimand, the treatment effect was estimated to be 0.51 (95%CI -1.33, 2.35) points higher in the reduction group.

This review examines the contribution of nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems to solving the problems associated with bacterial resistance and provides a thorough overview of their mechanisms of action, efficiency, and perspectives for the future. Owing to their unique physicochemical properties, nanomaterials reveal new ways of passing through the traditional mechanisms of bacterial defence connected to the permeability barrier of membranes, efflux pumps, and biofilm formation. This review addresses the different types of nanomaterials, including metallic nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles, in terms of their antimicrobial properties and modes of action. More emphasis has been placed on the critical discussion of recent studies on such active systems. Both in vitro and in vivo models are discussed, with particular attention paid to multidrug-resistant bacteria. This review begins by reviewing the urgency for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by citing recent statistics, which indicate that the number of deaths and reasons for financial losses continue to increase. A background is then provided on the limitations of existing antibiotic therapies and the pressing need to develop innovative approaches. Nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems have been proposed as promising solutions because of their potential to improve drug solubility, stability, and targeted delivery, although side effects can also be mitigated. In addition to established knowledge, this review also covers ongoing debates on the continuous risks associated with the use of nanomaterials, such as toxicity and environmental impact. This discussion emphasizes the optimization of nanomaterial design to target specific bacteria, and rigorous clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy in humans. It concludes with reflections on the future directions of nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems in fighting AMR, underlining the need for an interdisciplinary approach, along with continuous research efforts to translate these promising technologies into clinical practice. As the fight against bacterial resistance reaches its peak, nanomaterials may be the key to developing next-generation antimicrobial therapies.",,,,Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

40056928,"Epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in Latin America: an international, retrospective, cohort study.",,The Lancet. Haematology,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas represent a rare and heterogeneous group of mature T-cell neoplasms characterised by aggressive behavior. Previous studies evaluating peripheral T-cell lymphoma epidemiology across Latin America have been restricted in their representation of most countries in the region. In this study, we aimed to describe peripheral T-cell lymphoma epidemiology across Latin America.
We did an international, retrospective, cohort study of patients (aged ≥18 years) with newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma across 11 countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela). We used the hospital-based registries of the Grupo de Estudio Latinoamericano de Linfoproliferativos (retrospective registry; Jan 1, 2000, to June 30, 2023), the Brazilian T-cell Project (retrospective from Jan 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017 and prospective from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2023), and the International T-cell Lymphoma Project (prospective registry). The main outcomes were prevalence of peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes, overall survival, estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and objective response rate. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Overall response rate was calculated by summing complete and partial responses, with 95% CIs estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method.
1979 patients diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma by pathology, between 2000 and 2023, met our inclusion criteria for the distribution analysis and 1349 were included in the treatment patterns and outcome analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 54 years (IQR 41-67), 733 (41%) of 1794 patients were female, and 1061 (59%) patients were male. The most common subtype was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (688 [35%] of 1979 patients); the second and third most frequent subtypes were adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma (333 [17%] of 1979 patients) and extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma (291 [15%] of 1979 patients). The next most common subtypes were ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (186 [9%] of 1979 patients), mature T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (163 [8%] of 1979), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (123 [6%] of 1979 patients), and ALK-positive anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (73 [4%] of 1979 patients). The observed proportion of people with adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma was higher in Peru (158 [39%] of 414 patients; p<0·0001) and Colombia (17 [29%] of 58 patients; p=0·011), whereas the percentage for extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma was higher in Central America and the Caribbean (105 [41%] of 255 patients; p<0·0001) and Mexico (22 [31%] of 70 patients; p<0·0001). With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 12-60) in the analytical cohort, we observed 674 deaths, and 3-year overall survival was 40% (95% CI 38-44). ALK-positive anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma had the highest survival outcomes, with 11 deaths and a 3-year overall survival of 77% (95% CI 66-90), followed by ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (52 deaths and 3-year overall survival of 55%, 95% CI 46-65) and extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma (108 deaths and 3-year overall survival of 48%, 95% CI 42-56). The use of CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, and prednisone) or EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) was associated with superior 3-year overall survival compared with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) among patients with ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (20 deaths; 67%, 95% CI 56-81 vs 16 deaths; 41%, 26-65; p=0·018) and adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma (45 deaths; 20%, 11-38 vs 100 deaths; 18%, 12-27; p=0·0087), but not for all other subtypes.
Our study underscores the unique epidemiological profile of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in Latin America, with a high prevalence of adult T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma and extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma. These findings present a crucial opportunity to prioritise clinical trials on these rare subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma by integrating Latin American countries into global research. However, our findings require further validation in robust epidemiological studies.

40056927,GLP-1 receptor agonists in kidney transplant recipients with pre-existing diabetes: a retrospective cohort study.,,The lancet. Diabetes & endocrinology,"Given the cardiovascular, renal, and survival benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetes, these agents could be effective among kidney transplant recipients. However, kidney transplant recipients are distinct from GLP-1 receptor agonist trial participants, with longer diabetes duration and severity, greater end-organ damage, increased cardiovascular risk, and multimorbidity. We examined GLP-1 receptor agonist real-world effectiveness and safety in kidney transplant recipients with diabetes.
This USA-based retrospective cohort study included kidney transplant recipients with type 2 diabetes at transplantation and Medicare as their primary insurance from a national registry linked with Medicare claims. Post-transplantation GLP-1 receptor agonist use was identified through Medicare claims. Death-censored graft loss was estimated using the Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard model and extended Cox models were used for mortality and safety endpoints. Models incorporated inverse probability of treatment weights. To further test whether bias could affect the main results, a cohort was created in which each GLP-1 receptor agonist user was matched with a kidney transplant recipient who had not started a GLP-1 receptor agonist, was alive with a functioning graft, and had accrued the same amount of post-transplant survival time.
Between Jan 1, 2013 and Dec 31, 2020, we identified 44 536 first time kidney transplant recipients with Medicare as primary payer in the 6 months before and at transplantation. 24 192 patients were excluded as they did not have type 2 diabetes. 2328 patients were ineligible (1916 had missing values and 412 used GLP-1 receptor agonists before transplantation). The primary cohort thus consisted of 18 016 kidney transplant recipients with diabetes. Of these patients, 1969 (10·9%) had at least one GLP-1 receptor agonist prescription filled post-transplant. Compared with patients who had not received a GLP-1 receptor agonist, GLP-1 receptor agonist users were younger (median age at transplant 57 years [IQR 49-64] vs 60 years [51-66], p<0·0001) and more likely to be female (786 [39·9%] vs 5645 [35·2%], p<0·0001). Among GLP-1 receptor agonist users, 552 [28·0%] were non-Hispanic White, 703 [35·7%] were non-Hispanic Black, and 568 [28·8%] were Hispanic. The 5-year unadjusted cumulative incidence of death-censored graft loss from a cohort matched on survival time before GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation was 6·0% for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 10·7% for non-users (Gray's test p=0·004). The 5-year unadjusted cumulative incidence for mortality from a cohort matched on survival time before GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation was 17·0% for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 25·8% for non-users (log-rank p=0·0006). The 5-year unadjusted cumulative incidence for mortality was 13·5% for GLP-1 receptor agonist users and 19·9% for non-users (log-rank p<0·0001). GLP-1 receptor agonist use was associated with a 49% lower incidence of death-censored graft loss (adjusted subhazard ratio [aSHR] 0·51, 95% CI 0·36-0·71; p=0·0001) and 31% lower mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·55-0·86; p=0·001). Inferences were robust when matched on survival time (death-censored graft loss aSHR 0·53, 95% CI 0·37-0·75; p=0·0005; mortality aHR 0·70, 95% CI 0·55-0·88; p=0·003). Safety endpoints were rare and not associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, with the exception of diabetic retinopathy (aHR 1·49, 1·11-2·00; p=0·008).
GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with better graft and patient survival. Clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

40056922,"Immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of the vaccine H56:IC31 in reducing the rate of tuberculosis disease recurrence in HIV-negative adults successfully treated for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial.",,The Lancet. Infectious diseases,"People with tuberculosis who complete treatment remain at risk of recurrent disease. The vaccine H56:IC31 has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in phase 1 and 2 studies, but whether it can reduce the risk of tuberculosis recurrence is unknown.
In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial in South Africa (five clinical trial sites) and Tanzania (one clinical trial site), we enrolled participants aged 18-60 years, without HIV, who had completed more than 5 months (22 weeks) of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. During trial screening (≤7 days after starting treatment), two sputum samples were obtained and frozen for later comparison to recurrent isolates by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1; block size of four) to receive two intramuscular doses in the deltoid, 56 days apart, of H56:IC31 or placebo. After the first dose of H56:IC31 or placebo, participants were followed up until study day 421 (1 year after the second dose) and checked at each visit for tuberculosis signs and symptoms. If tuberculosis was suspected, two sputum samples were obtained: one sample was tested by automated molecular test (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) and sent for liquid culture; and the other sample was stored frozen for later analysis by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). At the last visit (day 421), two sputum samples were obtained from all sputum-productive participants, regardless of symptoms, to detect cases of asymptomatic tuberculosis. The primary endpoint was culture-confirmed recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis (due to relapse with the same strain, reinfection by a different strain, or indeterminate) occuring during the period starting at day 70 (14 days after the second dose) and ending on day 421 (1 year after the second dose). Vaccine efficacy against recurrent tuberculosis was derived from Cox proportional hazards models. Secondary endpoints included vaccine efficacy to prevent tuberculosis relapse or reinfection independently, as differentiated by WGS, and safety and immunogenicity outcomes (H56-specific CD4 T-cell responses and humoral anti-H56 IgG responses). Primary analysis of vaccine efficacy was based on modified intention-to-treat (mITT), in all randomly assigned participants except those with tuberculosis disease recurrence or who withdrew before day 70 (or 14 days after the second dose for those who received both doses). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03512249, and is complete.
831 participants (mean age 34·7 years [SD 11·1]; 229 [28%] female and 602 [72%] male; 549 [66%] Black) were enrolled from Jan 31, 2019, to Jan 20, 2022; 415 participants were randomly assigned to receive H56:IC31 and 416 to receive placebo. Follow-up was completed by March 20, 2023 (mean follow-up duration 410·1 days [SD 82·8]). In the primary mITT analysis, recurrent tuberculosis occurred in 23 of 400 participants in the H56:IC31 group (12 relapses, eight reinfections, and three indeterminate); and in 14 of 406 in the placebo group (six relapses, seven reinfections, and one indeterminate). Vaccine efficacy for prevention of recurrence was -73·8% (95% CI -246·9 to 9·8; p=0·10). Vaccine efficacy for prevention of relapse was -116·1% (-522·2 to 16·3; p=0·11) and for prevention of reinfection was -21·1% (-245·3 to 56·5; p=0·71). 2 weeks after the planned second dose, H56:IC31 had significantly increased the frequencies of H56-specific CD4 T cells expressing interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-2, or IL-17 in vaccinees (median percentage of CD4 T cells, 0·35% [IQR 0·19 to 0·57]) compared with placebo (0·11% [0·09 to 0·23]; p<0·0001). H56-specific IgG responses were significantly higher in H56:IC31 recipients (median arbitrary units per mL, 6·84 [IQR 1·64 to 32·8]) than in placebo recipients (1·94 [1·05 to 3·86]; p<0·0001). A greater proportion of H56:IC31 recipients had mild-to-moderate injection site reactions than placebo recipients (165 [40%] of 415 vs 78 [19%] of 416). No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Two participants who received H56:IC31 and six who received placebo died.
Vaccination with H56:IC31 at treatment completion for pulmonary tuberculosis did not reduce the risk of recurrent disease. H56:IC31 was well tolerated and immunogenic but might have increased the risk of relapses by endogenous strains.

40056806,Accurate evaluation of live-virus microneutralisation for SARS-CoV-2 variant JN.1 in the assessment of vaccination and therapeutics.,"Antibody neutralisation, Monoclonal therapeutics, SARS-CoV-2, Vaccine regulatory science, Vaccine strain selection",Vaccine,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants require rapid assessments of pathogenicity and evasion of existing immunity to inform policy. A crucial component of these assessments is accurate estimation of serum neutralising antibody titres using cultured live virus isolates. Here, we report a comparison of culture methods for Omicron sub-variant JN.1 and the subsequent evaluation of neutralising antibody titres (nAbTs) in recipients of BNT162b2-XBB.1.5 monovalent and the ancestral/BA.4/5 containing bivalent vaccines. We compared culture of JN.1 in either Vero V1 cells or Caco-2 cells, finding culture in Vero V1 either resulted in low-titre stocks or induced crucial mutations at the Spike furin cleavage site (FCS). Using sequence-clean culture stocks generated in Caco-2 cells, we assessed serum samples from 71 healthy adults eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination given as a 5th dose booster in the UK: all participants had detectable nAbs against JN.1 prior to vaccination, with baseline/pre-existing nAbTs between both vaccine groups comparable (p = 0.240). However, nAbTs against JN.1 post-vaccination were 2.6-fold higher for recipients of the monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine than the BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine (p < 0.001). Further, at clinically relevant concentrations the therapeutic monoclonal antibody Sotrovimab marginally maintains neutralisation of JN.1. Regular re-appraisal of methods and policy outcomes as new variants arise is required to ensure robust data are used to underpin future severity assessments and vaccine strain selection decisions.",,,,Copyright © 2024.

40056793,Safety in treatment: Classical pharmacotherapeutics and new avenues for addressing maternal depression and anxiety during pregnancy.,,Pharmacological reviews,"We aimed to review clinical research on the safety profiles of antidepressant drugs and associations with maternal depression and neonatal outcomes. We focused on neuroendocrine changes during pregnancy and their effects on antidepressant pharmacokinetics. Pregnancy-induced alterations in drug disposition and metabolism impacting mothers and their fetuses are discussed. We considered evidence for the risks of antidepressant use during pregnancy. Teratogenicity associated with ongoing treatment, new prescriptions during pregnancy, or pausing medication while pregnant was examined. The Food and Drug Administration advises caution regarding prenatal exposure to most drugs, including antidepressants, largely owing to a dearth of safety studies caused by the common exclusion of pregnant individuals in clinical trials. We contrasted findings on antidepressant use with the lack of treatment where detrimental effects to mothers and children are well researched. Overall, drug classes such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors appear to have limited adverse effects on fetal health and child development. In the face of an increasing prevalence of major mood and anxiety disorders, we assert that individuals should be counseled before and during pregnancy about the risks and benefits of antidepressant treatment given that withholding treatment has possible negative outcomes. Moreover, newer therapeutics, such as ketamine and κ-opioid receptor antagonists, warrant further investigation for use during pregnancy. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The safety of antidepressant use during pregnancy remains controversial owing to an incomplete understanding of how drug exposure affects fetal development, brain maturation, and behavior in offspring. This leaves pregnant people especially vulnerable, as pregnancy can be a highly stressful experience for many individuals, with stress being the biggest known risk factor for developing a mood or anxiety disorder. This review focuses on perinatal pharmacotherapy for treating mood and anxiety disorders, highlighting the current knowledge and gaps in our understanding of consequences of treatment.",,,,Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

These malignancies are distinguished by a high likelihood of metastasis and multisite recurrence, making them biologically different from other endometrial cancer sub-types. This review aims to analyze the existing evidence regarding molecular classification, new biomarkers, and innovative treatment approaches for these high-risk tumors. Herein, we explored the role of biomarkers, including HER2, TP53, and mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability hypermutated and their influence on treatment strategies, surveillance approaches, the potential role of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid, novel precision-based treatment options, and disparate survival outcomes for non-Hispanic Black and other underserved minority patients, along with strategies to improve outcomes for these patients. Substantial progress has been made in the last 5 years, prompting the following question: What lies ahead in the next 5 years? Our current understanding of uterine serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma underscores the necessity of continuing to prioritize biomarker-driven therapies and the development of novel treatments through clinical trials while integrating these new strategies with traditional approaches, such as surgical resection and cytotoxic chemotherapy.",,,,Copyright © 2025.

40056660,Effect of high-intensity interval training exercise on sleep quality in women with probable post-traumatic stress disorder: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Anxiety and hyperarousal, Exercise training, Heart rate variability, Psychological trauma",Sleep medicine,"Poor sleep quality is a major problem for women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Potential causes of poor sleep quality include elevated symptoms of anxiety, hyperarousal, and decreased high frequency-heart rate variability (HF-HRV). Exercise training both decreases anxiety symptoms and increases HF-HRV among samples without PTSD. The effect of exercise training on sleep quality, HF-HRV and PTSD-related symptoms has not been tested in a sample of women exposed to trauma. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) on sleep quality in a sample of women with probable PTSD and test if reductions in anxiety or hyperarousal symptoms and/or increased HF-HRV mediate improved sleep quality. Thirty women with poor sleep quality and a Post-Traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS-5) score indicative of PTSD (≥ 28) were randomly assigned to either six-weeks of HIIT or a waitlist control (WL). Sleep quality, PTSD and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline (BL), weeks 2, 4, 6, and post-intervention (POST). HF-HRV was measured at BL and POST. A mixed model ANOVA 2 group × 5 time interaction for sleep quality was significant (p < 0.001; HIIT BL: 11.27 ± 2.55; POST: 5.60 ± 2.03 versus WL BL: 9.47 ± 2.83; POST: 8.23 ± 2.39; Hedges' d = -1.57). Anxiety and hyperarousal symptom reductions significantly mediated sleep quality changes. HF-HRV mediation models were non-significant. HIIT-based cycle exercise training in a sample of women with probable PTSD improves sleep quality, and reductions in trait anxiety and hyperarousal symptoms mediated these improvements.

This was a comprehensive scoping literature review of SLE clinical trials and systematic reviews published since 2010. Studies were identified from 5 databases and were screened for eligibility. Candidate domains were extracted from the included studies. Candidate domains were winnowed and binned by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) SLE Advisory Group.
Of the 4063 studies identified, 507 met inclusion criteria and proceeded to data extraction. Multiple domains and items were extracted, which winnowing and binning reduced to 25 candidate domains.
The 25 candidate domains cover the important aspects of SLE and the 4 core areas of disease impact according to OMERACT framework. The 25 candidate domains constitute a feasible and manageable number of domains to proceed with to the core domain consensus stage that covers the wide range of impact of SLE.

40056469,Data Interoperability in COVID-19 Vaccine Trials: Methodological Approach in the VACCELERATE Project.,"adult, clinical trials, data management, harmonization, interoperability, metadata, pediatric, protocol, standards, systems",JMIR medical informatics,"Data standards are not only key to making data processing efficient but also fundamental to ensuring data interoperability. When clinical trial data are structured according to international standards, they become significantly easier to analyze, reducing the efforts required for data cleaning, preprocessing, and secondary use. A common language and a shared set of expectations facilitate interoperability between systems and devices.
The main objectives of this study were to identify commonalities and differences in clinical trial metadata, protocols, and data collection systems/items within the VACCELERATE project.
To assess the degree of interoperability achieved in the project and suggest methodological improvements, interoperable points were identified based on the core outcome areas-immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy (clinical/physiological). These points were emphasized in the development of the master protocol template and were manually compared in the following ways: (1) summaries, objectives, and end points in the protocols of 3 VACCELERATE clinical trials (EU-COVAT-1_AGED, EU-COVAT-2_BOOSTAVAC, and EU-COVPT-1_CoVacc) against the master protocol template; (2) metadata of all 3 clinical trials; and (3) evaluations from a questionnaire survey regarding differences in data management systems and structures that enabled data exchange within the VACCELERATE network.
The noncommonalities identified in the protocols and metadata were attributed to differences in populations, variations in protocol design, and vaccination patterns. The detailed metadata released for all 3 vaccine trials were clearly structured using internal standards, terminology, and the general approach of Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonisation (CDASH) for data collection (eg, on electronic case report forms). VACCELERATE benefited significantly from the selection of the Clinical Trials Centre Cologne as the sole data management provider. With system database development coordinated by a single individual and no need for coordination among different trial units, a high degree of uniformity was achieved automatically. The harmonized transfer of data to all sites, using well-established methods, enabled quick exchanges and provided a relatively secure means of data transfer.
This study demonstrated that using master protocols can significantly enhance trial operational efficiency and data interoperability, provided that similar infrastructure and data management procedures are adopted across multiple trials. To further improve data interoperability and facilitate interpretation and analysis, shared data should be structured, described, formatted, and stored using widely recognized data and metadata standards.

40056446,"Effect of the Combination of Hemodialysis and Hemoperfusion on Clearing Interleukin-31: A Prospective, Randomized Crossover Trial in Patients under Maintenance Hemodialysis.",,Iranian journal of kidney diseases,"Uremic pruritus (UP) is a disturbing symptom in a quite large proportion of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent studies have indicated a potential role of interleukin-31 (IL-31) in the pathophysiology of pruritus, and it is becoming a promising therapeutic target for UP. Hemoperfusion (HP) is an extracorporeal technique that has been shown to be effective in absorbing molecules which may be responsible for inducing pruritus. In this study, we conducted this study to explore whether additional HP could enhance the removal of IL-31 in UP patients.  Methods. The study was conducted in two parts. In Part A, the prevalence and intensity of UP were recorded and the basal serum IL-31 level was determined three times a week in HD patients. Patients with detectable serum IL-31 levels in part A were included in Part B. Each patient had two 4-h test sessions: conventional HD or HD plus HP (HDHP). The reduction ratio (RR) of IL-31 from HD and HDHP was compared.  Results. Forty patients completed part A and 40% of them were suffering from UP. Serum IL-31 was detected at significantly higher percentages in UP patients than in non-UP patients (50% vs 4.2%). Serum levels of IL-31 in UP patients were significantly higher than that in non-UP patients (median: 8.35pg/ml vs 7.8pg/ml). Serum IL-31 levels were significantly correlated with pruritus intensity in patients with UP(r = 0.55, P < .05). Eight patients were enrolled and completed part B. The use of combined HD and HP treatment produced a better RR for IL-31 than HD alone (34.26 ± 1.43% vs 15.28 ± 2.11%, P < .01).
IL-31 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of uremic pruritus.

40056428,From Theory to Therapy: Unlocking the Potential of Muscarinic Receptor Activation in Schizophrenia With the Dual M1/M4 Muscarinic Receptor Agonist Xanomeline and Trospium Chloride and Insights From Clinical Trials.,"KarXT, muscarinic receptors, psychosis, schizophrenia, xanomeline",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Since the 1950s, understanding of antipsychotic activity in schizophrenia has been largely grounded in the dopamine hypothesis. Most antipsychotics approved for schizophrenia interact with D2 dopamine receptors as an important part of their mechanism of action. While antipsychotics blocking D2 dopamine receptors can be effective for positive symptoms of schizophrenia, none are approved by regulatory authorities for predominant negative or cognitive symptoms. Moreover, many of these agents induce a range of problematic side effects related to D2 dopamine receptor blockade (e.g., drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia and related sexual side effects, sedation). This has prompted the search for novel mechanisms with improved efficacy and tolerability based on evidence supporting involvement of other neurotransmitter systems in schizophrenia pathophysiology, including acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate. Among these options, targeting muscarinic receptors emerged as a promising treatment strategy. In September 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved xanomeline and trospium chloride for treatment of adults with schizophrenia based on results from three 5-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and two 52 week open-label trials. In the placebo-controlled trials, xanomeline/trospium reduced symptoms of schizophrenia, was generally well tolerated, and was not associated with clinically meaningful motor symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, sexual side effects, or weight gain compared with placebo. The long-term safety of xanomeline/trospium was also confirmed in two 52-week, open-label trials. This paper reviews the preclinical and clinical rationale for muscarinic receptor activation as a treatment for schizophrenia and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of xanomeline/trospium.",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.

40056372,Safety of iGlarLixi in Japanese People with Type 2 Diabetes: A Post-marketing Database Study.,"Database analysis, Hyperglycaemia, Hypoglycaemia, IGlarLixi, Japan, Post-marketing surveillance, Type 2 diabetes",Advances in therapy,"In this post-marketing study in Japan, the occurrence of hospital-treated hypoglycaemia and severe hyperglycaemia requiring inpatient treatment was evaluated in various cohorts of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) newly switched to iGlarLixi, a titratable, once-daily, fixed-ratio combination of long-acting insulin glargine 100 U/mL (iGlar-100) and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA, lixisenatide).
In this retrospective, observational study, acute-care hospital data from adults with T2D were analysed from the Medical Data Vision database. In Cohort 1, the incidence rate of hospital-treated hypoglycaemia following newly prescribed iGlarLixi versus iGlar-100 was assessed. Cohort 2 was subdivided to evaluate the incidence rate of hospital-treated hypoglycaemia and severe hyperglycaemia requiring inpatient treatment in people switched to iGlarLixi from either a GLP-1 RA ± oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) or OADs alone (Cohort 2A) or from a GLP-1 RA and long-acting insulin ± OADs or long-acting insulin ± OADs (Cohort 2B).
Of the 438 people in the iGlarLixi group and 9295 people in the iGlar-100 group in Cohort 1, who had a median follow-up duration of 52 and 44 days, respectively, there were zero and 0.011 (95% CI 0.006-0.018) events per person-year of hospital-treated hypoglycaemia, respectively. Cohort 2A included 201 people each in the GLP-1 RA ± OADs and OADs alone groups, with a median follow-up duration of 76 and 101 days, respectively, and Cohort 2B included 255 people in the GLP-1 RA and long-acting insulin ± OADs group and 623 people in the long-acting insulin ± OADs group, with a median follow-up duration of 73 and 62 days, respectively; no cases of hospital-treated hypoglycaemia or severe hyperglycaemia requiring inpatient treatment were observed.
Consistent with clinical trials, this post-marketing database study observed that newly prescribed iGlarLixi has a low risk of serious hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia in Japanese people with T2D, irrespective of prior antidiabetic drug treatment.
The goal of type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment is to manage blood glucose levels and to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), T2D can be effectively managed using combination therapy with an insulin and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), such as insulin glargine 100 U/mL plus lixisenatide (also known as iGlarLixi); however, these injectable drugs carry risks of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia. In this study, these risks were evaluated in people who were newly prescribed iGlarLixi in Japan and enrolled in a large hospital database. Individuals were divided into various groups; in Cohort 1, hospital-treated hypoglycaemia following newly prescribed iGlarLixi versus insulin glargine 100 U/mL (iGlar-100), with or without OADs, was assessed; in Cohort 2, we evaluated hospital-treated hypoglycaemia and severe hyperglycaemia in people who switched to iGlarLixi from a GLP-1 RA with/without OADs or OADs alone (Cohort 2A), or from a GLP-1 RA and long-acting insulin with/without OADs or long-acting insulin with/without OADs (Cohort 2B). In Cohort 1, hospital-treated hypoglycaemia occurred in none of the 438 people in the iGlarLixi group and 14 of the 9295 people in the iGlar-100 group after a median follow-up of 52 and 44 days, respectively. In Cohort 2A (402 people) and Cohort 2B (878 people), there were no occurrences of hospital-treated hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia after a median follow-up of 101 and 73 days, respectively.

While TTR stabilizers such as tafamidis and acoramidis are the only FDA-approved treatments, novel gene-modulating therapies are emerging as transformative approaches. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies effectively reduce TTR production and have demonstrated promising clinical outcomes, though their use in cardiac amyloidosis remains investigational. CRISPR-Cas9 therapies represent a paradigm shift, offering a potential one-time treatment by permanently silencing the TTR gene. Recent clinical trials have shown significant TTR reduction and stabilization of disease biomarkers, although long-term safety and efficacy require further evaluation. Despite the lack of direct comparisons among these modalities, their emergence highlights a promising future for ATTR-CM management. This review discusses the pathogenesis of ATTR-CM, mechanisms of novel gene-modulating therapies, clinical evidence, challenges, and the future outlook for advancing treatment options.",,,,© 2025.

40056370,An Evaluation of Time Spent Completing Electronically Collected Patient-Reported Outcomes in Clinical Trials.,"Clinical trial, Clinical trial participation, Digital health technology, Electronic data collection, Patient reported outcome measures, eCOA",Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science,"Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important measures of efficacy in the context of clinical trials but are sometimes identified as time and resource intensive to study participants and site personnel. The objective of this research was to evaluate the amount of time that participants spend completing PROs via an electronic device in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials across several disease areas.
The electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA) data were obtained from Johnson & Johnson clinical trials across various disease areas from 2016 to 2023. Data were acquired from internal and external sources including clinical trial sites and eCOA partners. In total, 82 trials were analyzed, containing data from 33,633 unique participants, and 1,083,994 measurements of completed electronic PRO instruments. After data cleaning, descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed. Electronic PRO completion time was examined in two ways: by time-per-item and time-per-instrument for each PRO.
On average, participants spend about 16 s per item and an average of 2 min to complete a PRO instrument electronically. The average time to complete PRO instruments varied significantly by disease area and most eCOA were completed on study site tablets (68%) or personal handheld devices (31%).
Overall, patients spend an average of 16 s per item and 2 min per PRO instrument in clinical trial studies. PROs are a crucial component of clinical trial outcomes data and can be efficiently completed electronically by participants in clinical trials in a short amount of time.",,"On average, participants spend about 16 s per item and an average of 2 min to complete a PRO instrument electronically.

40056322,The effects of aromatherapy massage with mint and sweet almond oils on the sleep quality of patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to intensive care unit: a randomized clinical trial.,"Aromatherapy massage, Intensive care units, Mint, Sleep quality, Sweet almond, Traumatic brain injury",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,"Sleep disorder is common among hospitalized patients and also has a high prevalence after traumatic brain injury. Sleep disorder can have serious detrimental effects on disease recovery. One of the simple and non-invasive methods to improve the sleep quality of these patients is use of complementary medicine interventions and aromatherapy massage is one of these methods that may help to improve their sleep quality. Therefore, this study explored the effect of aromatherapy massage with mint and sweet almond oils on the sleep quality of patients with traumatic brain injury in intensive care units.
This study was a randomized clinical trial. In this study, 60 patients admitted to the intensive care unit were assigned to the intervention and sham therapy groups. The hands and feet of patients in the intervention group were massaged for 20 min with a combination of mint and sweet almond oils for three consecutive days. In the sham therapy group, hands and feet of patients were massaged with Vaseline. Both groups completed demographic questionnaire and Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 22 via central tendency and dispersion indices (frequency, percentage, average, and standard deviation), the chi-square test, independent t-test, and paired t-test with a significance level of 0.05.
Aromatherapy massage significantly increased the sleep quality of traumatic brain injury patients in intensive care units, meaning that the mean score of sleep quality in the intervention group compared to the sham therapy group after the intervention showed a significant increase. (P < 0.05).
According to the results of this study, the use of aromatherapy with a combination of mint oil and sweet almonds increases the sleep quality of traumatized patients admitted to intensive care units. Using a combination of mint oil and sweet almond oil to increase the sleep quality of patients similar to the research community can be helpful.

40056309,Selinexor in the treatment of liposarcoma: from preclinical evidence to clinical practice.,"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma, Liposarcoma, Sarcoma, Selinexor, XPO1","Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","Selinexor is a new compound studied for the treatment of liposarcoma, particularly dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS), where treatment options remain limited. As a first-in-class oral exportin-1 (XPO1) inhibitor, selinexor has shown anti-tumour activity in preclinical models, particularly in MDM2- and CDK4-amplified DDLPS, where it induces apoptosis, inhibits tumour growth and promotes nuclear retention of p53. Preclinical studies have also suggested potential synergy with doxorubicin and eribulin, although these findings have yet to be validated in randomised clinical trials. The phase II/III SEAL trial (NCT02606461) evaluated selinexor versus placebo in patients with advanced, previously treated DDLPS. While the study demonstrated a statistically significant, albeit modest, improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) from 2.1 to 2.8 months, no overall survival benefit was observed. In addition, selinexor was associated with significant toxicity, including fatigue, nausea and weight loss. Similarly, a phase Ib/II study (NCT03042819) evaluating selinexor in combination with doxorubicin reported a 21% response rate and a median PFS of 5.5 months, although this regimen was also associated with high rates of neutropenia and fatigue. Despite these results, selinexor is not currently approved for the treatment of liposarcoma and its clinical utility remains under investigation. Ongoing studies, such as the SeliSarc trial (NCT04595994) evaluating selinexor in combination with gemcitabine and the NRSTS2021 trial (NCT06239272) evaluating selinexor in paediatric soft tissue sarcoma, aim to further define its role. The results of these studies will be critical in determining whether selinexor can be incorporated into standard sarcoma treatment.",,,,"© 2025.

To identify articles suitable for this review, a search of the PubMed database was conducted in January 2025 using the keywords ""Carbidopa,"" ""MK-486,"" and ""L-alpha-methyldopa hydrazine.""
The pharmacotherapeutic role of carbidopa extends beyond the management of Parkinson's disease. Our literature search revealed the use of carbidopa in three primary autonomic diseases to treat either nausea or symptoms of sympathetic hyperactivity: (1) familial dysautonomia, (2) hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and (3) afferent baroreflex failure (familial or acquired). Even at a dose as high as 600 mg/day, carbidopa was not associated with bothersome side effects in some of the clinical trials on familial dysautonomia. Pre-clinical evidence also suggests in vitro and in vivo inhibition of T-cell activation by carbidopa and a potential therapeutic use in cytokine release syndrome.
Current evidence, although limited, suggests that carbidopa has a favorable safety profile. While large, well-designed studies are warranted, observations from case series and small studies suggest that carbidopa could have utility in treating nausea in familial dysautonomia and symptoms of sympathetic hyperactivity in hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and afferent baroreflex failure.",,"The pharmacotherapeutic role of carbidopa extends beyond the management of Parkinson's disease.

Single-agent ICI therapy, such as cemiplimab (ORR 27.8%), has shown responses primarily in UV- and radiation-associated angiosarcomas, likely due to their higher tumor mutation burden (TMB), while dual ICI therapy (SWOG S1609, ORR 25%) suggests potential benefit but remains limited in cutaneous disease. ICI-TKI combinations, such as cabozantinib plus nivolumab (Alliance A091902, second-line, ORR 59%), demonstrated significant efficacy in both cutaneous and non-cutaneous angiosarcomas, suggesting anti-angiogenic therapy may enhance ICI responses in tumors historically resistant to checkpoint blockade. ICI-chemotherapy combinations have been less consistent. The Alliance A091902 first-line trial (paclitaxel ± nivolumab) found no overall PFS benefit, though scalp/face angiosarcoma patients appeared to fare better, raising the question of whether ICI alone might be equally effective in this subset. The South Korean paclitaxel + avelumab trial (ORR 50%) showed promising response rates, but the lack of detailed subgroup analysis limits interpretation. Other chemotherapy-ICI combinations, such as doxorubicin plus pembrolizumab, have shown isolated responses but require further study in larger cohorts. Moving forward, better biomarkers are critical for identifying which patients benefit most from ICIs, and while TKI-ICI combinations appear to hold the most promise, chemotherapy-ICI strategies need further refinement to optimize sequencing and patient selection in angiosarcoma treatment.",,,,"© 2025.

40056278,Effects of intra-articular tranexamic acid injection with different acting times after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a cohort study with historical controls.,"Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, International Knee Documentation Committee functional score, Postoperative drainage output, Tranexamic acid, Visual analog scale",Journal of orthopaedics and traumatology : official journal of the Italian Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology,"Intra-articular tranexamic acid (TXA) has been proven effective in reducing postoperative bleeding in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). We aimed to evaluate the effect of intra-articular injection of TXA with different acting times after an ACLR procedure.
Patients receiving ACLR and intra-articular injection of TXA between September 2023 and January 2024 were randomly divided into two groups, with drainage clamped for 4 h (TXA 4 h group) or 8 h (TXA 8 h group). Postoperative drainage output was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale (VAS), grade of hemarthrosis, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) functional score. The data of another two groups of patients (TXA 2 h group and placebo group) were retrieved from a previous study as historical control groups for subsequent analysis.
121 patients were included. There were no significant differences in drainage output between TXA 4 h and TXA 8 h groups. On postoperative day 3, significantly decreased grades of hemarthrosis were noted in the TXA 8 h group (P = 0.030). There were no significant differences in the VAS at different postoperative time points or in the IKDC scores. Comparison with the placebo and TXA 2 h groups revealed significant reduction in postoperative drainage among the TXA 4 h and 8 h groups. The IKDC scores were significantly worse in the TXA 8 h group compared with the TXA 2 h (P < 0.001) and placebo (P = 0.009) groups.
A 4 h clamping time for intra-articular TXA administration after ACLR may be considered in current practice, as it effectively reduces drainage and pain without negatively impacting functional outcomes.

Immunotherapy with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has been tried with promising outcomes. Acyclovir is an antiviral with established efficacy against DNA viruses, could become a possible revolutionary therapeutic option for warts. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of intralesional acyclovir versus quadrivalent human papilloma virus vaccine in treatment of recalcitrant cutaneous warts. A total of 60 patients with recalcitrant warts were assigned into 3 groups: group I, 20 patients received Intralesional injection of acyclovir, group II, 20 patient received intralesional quadrivalent HPV vaccine, and group III, 20 patients received intralesional injection of normal saline. The patients were followed up monthly for 3 months after the last injection to detect any recurrence. Complete clearance was observed in 8 patients (40%) in group I, 16 patients (80%) in group II and no response in group III. The most common side effects were pain (100%) among all groups, hemorrhagic eschars in group I(100%), edema in group II(30%) while the least was flu like symptoms (5%) in group II. both intralesional quadrivalent HPV vaccine and intralesional acyclovir seem to be promising, well-tolerated therapeutic options for the treatment of warts, with statistically significant superiority of the quadrivalent vaccine over acyclovir.",,,,"© 2025.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42024594487) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CMNT versus minoxidil alone for AGA, following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search across six databases was performed up to September 8, 2024. We identified 12 RCTs involving 631 AGA patients, with a total of 11 RCTs included in the meta-analyses. CMNT significantly improved hair count compared to minoxidil monotherapy (SMD 1.32, 95% CI 0.73-1.92, p < 0.01), with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 88%, p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated no significant effect of microneedling (MN) depth (≤ 1 mm vs. >1 mm), duration (≤ 12 weeks vs. >12 weeks), or technique(device) (electrodynamic vs. rolling) on hair count outcomes. Additionally, A meta-analysis of six RCTs demonstrated a significant improvement in hair diameter with CMNT (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.11-0.58; p < 0.01), with no observed heterogeneity (I² = 0%). Investigators and patient's self-assessment scores were also improved. Adverse events were more frequent with CMNT (74 vs. 59 events), however they were generally considered mild or self-limiting. CMNT significantly enhances hair count and diameter in AGA patients with mild adverse events. MN parameters including depth, duration, and technique variations did not significantly affect hair count outcome, suggesting microneedling as a promising adjunctive AGA treatment.",,,,© 2025.
