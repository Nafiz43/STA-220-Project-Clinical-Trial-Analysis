40087766,Beyond expectations: investigating nilotinib's potential in attenuating neurodegeneration in alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer disease, Autophagy, Memory, Neurodegeneration, Protein aggregates, Repurposed",Alzheimer's research & therapy,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose a formidable global challenge. While therapeutic options are available, their limitations are significant, necessitating the development of innovative treatment approaches. Here, we highlight the importance of repurposing drugs and discuss the future of drug treatments for AD. We review the potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for mitigating AD pathology and symptoms, as well as neurodegenerative processes more broadly. We focus on nilotinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has unique mechanisms of action involving the modulation of cell responses and removal of toxic proteins associated with AD pathogenesis. Encouraging studies have demonstrated its efficacy, calling for further investigation through clinical trials to assess its potential in various neurodegenerative conditions. However, despite these promising preclinical findings, no clinical studies have yet conclusively demonstrated its efficacy in treating AD. Considering the future directions in AD research, personalized medicine approaches hold promise by incorporating patient-specific factors, including sex and gender differences, to tailor nilotinib treatment for improved efficacy and safety profiles.",,,,© 2025.

40086910,Correlation between changes in apathy and cognition in Alzheimer's disease associated apathy: Analysis of the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2).,"Alzheimer’s disease, Apathy, Cognition, Methylphenidate",International psychogeriatrics,"Previous trials have shown improvements in both apathy and cognition with methylphenidate (MPH).
To assess whether changes in apathy correlated with changes in cognition in the Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial 2 (ADMET 2).
Mild to moderate AD patients with clinically significant apathy randomized to MPH (20 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months.
Apathy was measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-apathy (NPI-A) domain. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Hopkins Verbal Learning (immediate [HVLT-I], delayed [HVLT-D] recall), Digit Span (Forward [DF], Backward [DB]), Trail Making (TMT-A, TMT-B), Action Verbal Fluency (AV), Category Fluency (CF), and the Short Boston Naming Test (BNT).
Linear mixed models included cognitive change scores as dependent variables and time, treatment, change in NPI-A and the interaction between treatment and change in NPI-A as independent variables, which were additionally adjusted for baseline NPI-A and cognitive scores, age, sex, level of education and presence of diabetes.
199 participants (66 % male) were included (98-MPH, 101-placebo). Among all participants, worsening CF was associated with worsening apathy (-0.15 (0.05), p = .003). In addition, change in HVLT-I was associated with the interaction between changes in apathy and treatment (-0.31 (0.07), p = 0.0000158).
Changes in apathy are mostly independent of cognitive changes and apathy response to MPH may be independent from cognition.

40083386,The effect of tanshinones on cognitive impairments in animal models of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Alzheimer’s disease, animal models, cognitive impairment, meta-analysis, tanshinones",Frontiers in pharmacology,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurological illness that poses a significant hazard to human health. A fat-soluble compound called tanshinones was isolated from Danshen, a traditional Chinese herb. Recent years have seen reports of clinical trials examining the effects of tanshinones on cognitive impairment among individuals with AD, as well as the publication of pertinent basic research. Tanshinones are not yet commonly utilized in the therapeutic treatment of AD, and the effectiveness of tanshinones as a treatment program for AD is not yet adequately supported by evidence. To assess the impact of tanshinones on cognitive impairment in experimental rodent models of AD, we carried out a systematic review in this work.
All relevant studies on the usage of tanshinones in AD model animals published in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedicine Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure before 8 September 2024, were systematically retrieved. To assess the methodological quality, the CAMARADES checklist was used. Meta-analysis was calculated and graphed in the Stata 14.0 software. For each outcome in every study, the standard mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of each effect size were calculated.
Fourteen studies were included in this study. Compared with the AD model group without tanshinones intervention, tanshinones significantly reduced the number of escape latency [SMD = -2.082, 95% CI = (-2.481, -1.683), p < 0.001]. Tanshinones also increased the times of platform crossing [SMD = 1.464, 95% CI = (1.183, 1.744), p < 0.001] and time in target quadrants [SMD = 2.703, 95% CI = (2.132, 3.275), p < 0.001].
Tanshinones are thought to have positive effects on cognitive impairment in rodent models of AD, according to the findings of this study. However, the level of quality of the included research may have an impact on the accuracy of positive outcomes. Thus, more high-quality randomized controlled animal studies are required to guide future scientific and clinical research.

It can release metabolites that could affect the nervous system. The bidirectional communication between the intestine and the central nervous system is known as the gut-brain axis. This communication can be impacted by the microbiota in various direct and indirect ways. There has been a suggested connection between the microbiome and many neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. This has been explored in human and animal studies. While no microbial biomarkers have been identified yet, alterations in several taxa have been suggested to be associated with disease states.

However, in recent years, innovative therapeutic strategies have tried to bypass the restriction of traditional drug delivery methods. In vivo gene therapy refers to emerging biopharma vectors that carry the specific genes and target and infect specific tissues; these infected cells and tissues then undergo fundamental changes at the genetic level and produce therapeutic proteins or substances, thus providing therapeutic benefits. Clinical and preclinical trials mainly utilize adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), lentiviruses (LVs), and other viruses as gene vectors for disease investigation. Although LVs have a higher gene-carrying capacity, the vector of choice for many neurological diseases is the AAV vector due to its safety and long-term transgene expression in neurons. Here, we review the basic biology of AAVs and summarize some key issues in recombinant AAV (rAAV) engineering in gene therapy research; then, we summarize recent clinical trials using rAAV treatment for neurological diseases and provide translational perspectives and future challenges on target selection.",,,,,10.3390/ijms26052213,2025-03-13,"Shuming Wang, Lin Xiao"

This study explores the efficacy of a sub-immunosuppressive TAC dosing regimen to ameliorate AD-related pathologies. TAC was administered daily for 14 days, with drug concentrations measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in whole blood and hippocampal tissue from C57BL6J mice, while immunofluorescence analyses and Western blotting (performed on hippocampal extracts) were conducted in 10-12 month old 3xTg-AD mice to evaluate levels of tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins. The results from LC-MS/MS revealed that lower TAC doses resulted in sub-immunosuppressive blood levels, while still penetrating the hippocampi. Immunofluorescence showed reductions in tau and Aβ proteins in 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, Western blot analyses revealed reductions in tau and Aβ, along with increases in synaptic and autophagy-related proteins. These findings highlight the potential of sub-immunosuppressive TAC doses in effectively targeting AD pathology while minimizing the risk of chronic systemic immunosuppression. Further research and clinical trials are warranted to establish the optimal TAC dosing regimen for AD treatment.",,,,,10.3390/ijms26051797,2025-03-13,"Jacqueline Silva, Batbayar Tumurbaatar, Jutatip Guptarak, Wen-Ru Zhang, Anna Fracassi, Giulio Taglialatela"

Blood glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has garnered attention as a FTD biomarker. However, investigations of GFAP in FTD have been hampered by symptomatic and histopathologic heterogeneity and small cohort sizes contributing to inconsistent findings. Therefore, we evaluated plasma GFAP as a FTD biomarker and compared its performance to that of neurofilament light (NfL) protein, a leading FTD biomarker.
We availed ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) study resources to conduct a comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of the susceptibility/risk, prognostic, and predictive performance of GFAP and NfL in the largest series of well-characterized presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and participants with sporadic or familial FTD syndromes. Utilizing single molecule array technology, we measured GFAP and NfL in plasma from 161 controls, 127 presymptomatic mutation carriers, 702 participants with a FTD syndrome, and 67 participants with mild behavioral and/or cognitive changes. We used multivariable linear regression and Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for co-variates to examine the biomarker utility of baseline GFAP and NfL concentrations or their rates of change.
Compared to controls, GFAP and NfL were elevated in each FTD syndrome but GFAP, unlike NfL, poorly discriminated controls from participants with mild symptoms. Similarly, both baseline GFAP and NfL were higher in presymptomatic mutation carriers who later phenoconverted, but NfL better distinguished non-converters from phenoconverters. We additionally observed that GFAP and NfL were associated with disease severity indicators and survival, but NfL far outperformed GFAP. Nevertheless, we validated findings that the GFAP/NfL ratio may discriminate frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau versus TDP-43 pathology.
Our head-to-head comparison of plasma GFAP and NfL as biomarkers for FTD indicate that NfL consistently outmatched GFAP as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for participants with a FTD syndrome, and as a susceptibility/risk biomarker for people at genetic risk of FTD. Our findings underscore the need to include leading biomarkers in investigations evaluating new biomarkers if the field is to fully ascertain their performance and clinical value.",,"Compared to controls, GFAP and NfL were elevated in each FTD syndrome but GFAP, unlike NfL, poorly discriminated controls from participants with mild symptoms.

40074078,Distinct neuronal vulnerability and metabolic dysfunctions are characteristic features of fast-progressing Alzheimer's patients with Lewy bodies.,,The Journal of biological chemistry,"Tau protein accumulation is linked to dementia progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with potential co-pathologies contributing to it. The progression of dementia in AD patients varies between individuals, and the association between co-pathology and heterogeneity in dementia progression rate remains unclear. We used longitudinal cohort data, postmortem brain tissues, and biochemical methods such as immunoassays and proteomic profiling to investigate the molecular components associated with progression rate. We report that AD with comorbidities, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and TDP-43 pathology, progress faster than AD alone. AD-DLB patients had higher levels of soluble oligomeric tau proteins and lower levels of insoluble tau proteins compared to those with AD alone. Our data suggest that α-synuclein fibrils may enhance tau aggregation through cross-seeding. The prefrontal cortex is more vulnerable to Lewy body pathology than the temporal cortex, and Tau and α-synuclein aggregate in distinct neuronal populations, indicating selective neuronal and regional vulnerability to their respective pathologies. Dysfunctional metabolic pathways were more strongly associated with fast-progressing AD-DLB patients.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBBM) could play a critical role in the identification and referral of patients suspected of AD to specialty care. A multidisciplinary AD Biomarker Task Force was convened to evaluate current biomarker use cases, define an optimal biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway, and understand factors impacting adoption. The Task Force identified opportunities to support biomarker-enabled AD diagnostic care pathway adoption, including streamlining risk assessment and screening by leveraging digital tools, activating primary care providers through education, generating data to expand applicability to diverse populations, and advocating for aligned policies and quality measures. Adoption of BBBMs in the primary care setting will be critical to improve early AD detection. However, challenges to pathway adoption persist and will require action from clinicians, payers, policy makers, and patients to address.

40070441,Distinct spatiotemporal atrophy patterns in corticobasal syndrome are associated with different underlying pathologies.,"biomarkers, corticobasal syndrome, disease progression, machine learning, subtype and stage inference",Brain communications,"Although the corticobasal syndrome was originally most closely linked with the pathology of corticobasal degeneration, the 2013 Armstrong clinical diagnostic criteria, without the addition of aetiology-specific biomarkers, have limited positive predictive value for identifying corticobasal degeneration pathology in life. Autopsy studies demonstrate considerable pathological heterogeneity in corticobasal syndrome, with corticobasal degeneration pathology accounting for only ∼50% of clinically diagnosed individuals. Individualized disease stage and progression modelling of brain changes in corticobasal syndrome may have utility in predicting this underlying pathological heterogeneity, and in turn improve the design of clinical trials for emerging disease-modifying therapies. The aim of this study was to jointly model the phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity of corticobasal syndrome, to identify unique imaging subtypes based solely on a data-driven assessment of MRI atrophy patterns and then investigate whether these subtypes provide information on the underlying pathology. We applied Subtype and Stage Inference, a machine learning algorithm that identifies groups of individuals with distinct biomarker progression patterns, to a large cohort of 135 individuals with corticobasal syndrome (52 had a pathological or biomarker defined diagnosis) and 252 controls. The model was fit using volumetric features extracted from baseline T1-weighted MRI scans and then used to subtype and stage follow-up scans. The subtypes and stages at follow-up were used to validate the longitudinal consistency of the baseline subtype and stage assignments. We then investigated whether there were differences in associated pathology and clinical phenotype between the subtypes. Subtype and Stage Inference identified at least two distinct and longitudinally stable spatiotemporal subtypes of atrophy progression in corticobasal syndrome; four-repeat-tauopathy confirmed cases were most commonly assigned to the ",,,,© The Author(s) 2025.

In these post hoc, blinded analyses of plasma and CSF samples from the completed two-site placebo controlled randomized trial testing of 1500 mg PO BID oral nicotinamide, we used mass spectroscopy to measure nicotinamide and its inactive metabolite 1-methyl-nicotinamide in plasma at baseline, 6, and 12 months and in CSF at baseline and 12 months from 23 participants on drug and 24 on placebo.
Pharmacokinetic analysis found mean 12 month plasma nicotinamide increased > 130-fold to 52 μM while mean methyl-nicotinamide increased > 600-fold to 91 μM in individuals receiving nicotinamide compared to those receiving placebo, whose levels were unchanged from baseline. However, CSF nicotinamide was only measurable in 6 of the 19 available participants (32%) (mean increase of at least 147-fold to 18 μM). These CSF nicotinamide concentrations were 66% of their plasma levels, indicating good CNS bioavailability in only some participants. In contrast to CSF nicotinamide, more treated participants had higher CSF methyl-nicotinamide (n = 9, 43 μM), suggesting high-dosage nicotinamide was sufficient to pass the blood-brain barrier, but 13 of 19 were metabolically inactivated.

Our findings suggest that oral administration markedly increased mean plasma nicotinamide levels, however CSF levels were below quantitation in a majority of participants and there was extensive metabolic inactivation to methyl-nicotinamide. Both the bioavailability and rapid metabolic methylation need to be addressed if nicotinamide is further developed as a potential intervention for AD.

40067821,CNM-Au8 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial.,,JAMA,"Bioenergetic failure has been proposed as a driver of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). CNM-Au8 is a suspension of gold nanocrystals that catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride into NAD+, resulting in an increase of cellular adenosine triphosphate production.
To determine the effects of CNM-Au8 on ALS disease progression.
CNM-Au8 was tested as a regimen of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind platform trial. The study was conducted at 54 sites in the US from July 2020 to March 2022 (final follow-up, March 17, 2022). A total of 161 participants with ALS were randomized to receive CNM-Au8 (n = 120) or regimen-specific placebo (n = 41). Data from 123 concurrently randomized placebo participants in other regimens were combined for analyses.
Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to receive CNM-Au8 60 mg daily (n = 61), CNM-Au8 30 mg daily (n = 59), or matching placebo (n = 41) for 24 weeks.
The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline through week 24 in ALS disease severity measured by a bayesian shared parameter model of function (based on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale) and survival, which provided an estimate of the rate of disease progression measured by the disease rate ratio (DRR), with a DRR of less than 1 indicating treatment benefit. Secondary end points included a Combined Assessment of Function and Survival using a joint-rank test, rate of decline in slow vital capacity (percent predicted), and survival free of permanent assisted ventilation.
Among 161 participants who were randomized within the CNM-Au8 regimen (mean age, 58.4 years; 61 [37.9%] female), 145 (90%) completed the trial. In the primary analysis comparing the combined CNM-Au8 dosage groups vs the combined placebo groups, the primary end point (DRR, 0.97 [95% credible interval, 0.783-1.175]; posterior probability of DRR <1, 0.65) and the 3 secondary end points suggested no benefit or harm of CNM-Au8. In the active (n = 120) vs placebo (n = 163) groups, the most common adverse events were diarrhea (23 [19%] vs 12 [7%]), nausea (17 [14.2%] vs 14 [8.6%]), fatigue (12 [10.8%] vs 30 [18.4%]), and muscular weakness (24 [20%] vs 45 [27.6%]).

40065918,Perspective: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.,"Alzheimer's disease, MCID, anchor, clinical trials, meaningfulness, outcome measures","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)","The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is a measure of the minimal clinically relevant change. The MCID represents the smallest difference in score on the measure or domain of interest which patients or clinicians perceive as beneficial or as meaningful decline. The MCID is not an alternative clinical trial outcome; it does not apply to group measures and is used as a means of determining whether an individual patient has reached a threshold of change. MCIDs have been derived for symptomatic treatments and for disease targeted therapies. MCIDs have been derived for nearly all clinical trial instruments used in AD therapeutic research. Application of the MCID to patients on disease-targeted therapies requires awareness of the expected increasing treatment-no treatment difference exhibited by these agents. The MCID complements other strategies for assessing the meaningfulness of interventions including effect size, number needed to treat, responder analyses, time saved, quality of life, and quality-adjusted life years. MCID is not a required measure for regulatory approval of a therapeutic since it is applicable to individual patients and not to group outcomes or mean differences used to determine treatment benefit in clinical trials.
MCID is a key measure of within-person change in cognition, function, or behavior when it is applied to metrics of Alzheimer's disease progression.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID or minimum within person change (MWPC) can function as useful means of determining if a patient has progressed to thresholds of detectable change.In Alzheimer's disease, MCID/MWPC can be used to determine the number or percent of individuals who have progressed to detectable levels of within-person change, with differences anticipated in active treatment and placebo groups.MCID/MWPC are not measures that are appropriately applied to group outcomes of clinical trials.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2a clinical trial that tested the safety and efficacy of laromestrocel, a bone-marrow-derived, allogeneic mesenchymal stem-cell therapy, in slowing AD clinical progression, atrophy and neuroinflammation. Participants across ten centers in the United States were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four infusion groups: group 1 (placebo; four monthly infusions, n = 12); group 2 (25 million cells, one infusion followed by three monthly infusions of placebo, n = 13); group 3 (25 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 13); and group 4 (100 million cells; four monthly doses, n = 11). The study met its primary end point of safety; the rate of treatment-emergent serious adverse events within 4 weeks of any infusion was similar in all four groups: group 1, 0% (95% CI 0-26.5%); group 2, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%); group 3, 7.7% (95% CI 0.2-36%) and group 4, 9.1% (95% CI 0.2-41.3%). Additionally, there were no reported infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivities or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Laromestrocel improved clinical assessments at 39 weeks compared to placebo, as measured by a composite AD score (secondary end point was met: group 2 versus placebo change: 0.38; 95% CI -0.06-0.82), Montreal cognitive assessment and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living. At 39 weeks, Laromestrocel slowed the decline of whole brain volume compared to placebo (n = 10) by 48.4% for all treatment groups combined (groups 2-4: P = 0.005; n = 32) and left hippocampal volume by 61.9% (groups 2-4, P = 0.021; n = 32), and reduced neuroinflammation as measured by diffusion tensor imaging. The change in bilateral hippocampal atrophy correlated with the change in mini-mental state exam scores (R = 0.41, P = 0.0075) in all study patients (N = 42). Collectively these results support safety of single and multiple doses of laromestrocel treatment for mild AD and provide indications of efficacy in combating decline of brain volume and potentially cognitive function. Larger-scale clinical trials of laromestrocel in AD are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05233774 .",,,,© 2025.

Conventional drug discovery approaches have been unsuccessful in providing efficient interventions due to their 'one-size-fits-all' nature. As an alternative, personalised drug development holds promise to pre-select responders and identifying suitable indicators of drug efficacy. In this exploratory study, we have established a pipeline with the potential to guide patient stratification studies before clinical trials. This pipeline uses 2D and 3D in vitro models of monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi) from AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and matched healthy control (HC) individuals. By profiling cytokine responses in these models using multidimensional analyses, we have observed that the 3D model offers a more defined separation of profiles between individuals based on disease status. While this pilot study focuses on AD and MCI, future investigations incorporating other neurodegenerative disorders will be necessary to validate the pipeline's findings and demonstrate its broader applicability.",,,,© 2025.

Identifying clinical features and individual risk factors for ARIA could facilitate effective prediction and prevention strategies.
To characterize ARIA in participants treated with donanemab.
These prespecified and post hoc exploratory analyses use data from the placebo-controlled portions of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 randomized clinical trials, conducted from December 2017 to December 2020 and from June 2020 to April 2023, respectively. Additional analyses are included from a stand-alone open-label addendum conducted from August 2021 through August 2023. Participants in the placebo-controlled trials and the open-label addendum aged 60 to 85 years with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease and elevated amyloid levels were included. The placebo-controlled trials, but not the addendum, had tau inclusion criteria.
Placebo-controlled trial participants were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or donanemab, and all open-label participants received donanemab. Donanemab was administered every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks.
The primary outcomes were the frequency, radiographic severity, seriousness, symptoms, timing relative to donanemab treatment, and risk factors for ARIA.
Across 3030 total participants (placebo-controlled trials: 999 placebo participants, 984 donanemab participants; open-label addendum: 1047 donanemab participants), mean (SD) age was approximately 73.7 (6.0) years and 1684 participants (55.6%) were female. Frequencies of ARIA-edema/effusions (ARIA-E) and ARIA-microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) were higher with donanemab (24.4% and 31.3% in placebo-controlled trials, respectively; 19.8% and 27.2% in open-label addendum, respectively) than with placebo (1.9% and 13.0%, respectively). ARIA-E was mostly mild or moderate in severity. Serious ARIA-E was reported in 1.5% and symptomatic ARIA-E in 5.8% of donanemab-treated participants in the placebo-controlled trials. Symptoms most frequently reported with ARIA-E were headache and confusional state. In 58.3% of donanemab-treated participants with ARIA-E, the first event occurred by the third infusion (approximately month 3). Risk analysis demonstrated independent associations between ARIA-E and 6 baseline variables, including increased risk with APOE ε4 allele number, greater number of microhemorrhages, presence of cortical superficial siderosis, higher amyloid plaque, and elevated mean arterial pressure, and decreased risk with antihypertensive use.

A longitudinal, controlled experiment was conducted with random assignment to experimental and control groups. The experimental group underwent three weekly interventions of 45-50 min over eight months in 2021. Cognitive functions were periodically assessed using ACE-R. Power analysis determined a sample size of 128 participants for adequate statistical power; the study included 60 participants (30 per group). Data were analyzed using non-parametric methods due to non-normal data distribution. The experimental group showed significant improvement in ACE-R scores compared to the control group. The mean difference in scores was 10.27 points (SD = 2.83) for the experimental group, indicating improved cognitive function, while the control group showed a mean decrease of 5.67 points (SD = 2.06). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences between groups at both interim and final assessments (p < 0.001).

Biomarkers associated with the pathways of these mutations, such as glucocerebrosidase enzyme (GCase) activity and amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) levels, may hold potential as predictive indicators, providing valuable insights into the likelihood of cognitive decline within these diagnoses. Our objective was to determine their association with cognitive decline in DLB and PD.
A total of 121 DLB patients from the European-DLB Consortium and 117 PD patients from the Norwegian ParkWest Study were included in this study. The four most commonly associated variants of GBA1 mutations (E326K, T369M, N370S, L444P), APOEε4 status, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 levels and GCase activity were assessed, as well as global cognition using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to evaluate the association of CSF biomarkers with cognitive decline in each diagnostic group, adjusted for age, sex, education, and genetic mutation profile.
Low CSF Aβ42 levels were associated with accelerated cognitive decline in DLB, whereas reduced CSF GCase activity predicted faster cognitive decline in PD. These associations were independent of GBA1 gene mutations or APOEε4 status.

40050704,Microglial mechanisms drive amyloid-β clearance in immunized patients with Alzheimer's disease.,,Nature medicine,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies utilizing amyloid-β (Aβ) immunization have shown potential in clinical trials. Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance Aβ-targeted immunotherapies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.",,,,© 2025.

A multidomain lifestyle intervention has shown favourable effects on cognition. We aimed to investigate if frailty status modifies this intervention effect.
The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) recruited 1259 participants aged 60-77 years who were at risk of dementia. They were randomised to receive a multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training and vascular risk monitoring) or regular health advice for two years. The outcome was a change in cognition (neuropsychological test battery composite score). Frailty and prefrailty were defined according to the Fried phenotype. Mixed models were used to investigate if frailty status at baseline modified the intervention effect on cognition.
Frailty status (prefrail/frail n = 520, robust n = 625) at baseline did not modify the effect of intervention on global cognition during the 2-year follow-up (P-value for frailty × intervention × time interaction > .05). Concerning cognitive subdomains, similar results were found. Among prefrail/frail persons, within-group analyses suggested a beneficial intervention effect on executive function and processing speed and also on global cognition when frail participants (n = 15) were excluded from the analyses. Being prefrail/frail was related to less improvement in global cognition, memory and executive function domains compared with being robust when intervention was not taken into consideration.

To explore this further, our study aimed to assess the increased statistical power achieved by incorporating all or multiple post-baseline visits to estimate treatment effect, compared to relying solely on the last visit.
We developed explicit formulas for the base functions of the natural cubic spline model, ensuring compatibility with standard SAS procedures. Through simulations using disease progression trajectories from ClarityAD and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 trials, we comprehensively evaluated various models in terms of power and type I error. Additionally, we offer SAS codes that to facilitate seamless implementation of different modeling approaches.
Simulations based on ClarityAD and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 disease trajectories demonstrated that models incorporating multiple or all post-baseline visits yield greater power than those using only the last visit, while maintaining Type I error control.

Pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions are limited. Memesto is a wearable audio device designed to provide messages and music that can be scheduled or played on demand. The objective of this proof-of-principle study was to quantify whether Memesto can reduce agitation in persons with AD/ADRD.
Persons living with AD/ADRD with a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) average score of 4 or greater, one informal caregiver, and one formal caregiver (triad) were recruited from residential care facilities in the Midwest region of the United States. After consent and a two-week training period, the triad was monitored every two weeks from Baseline to Week 10 with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) agitation domain subscale (primary endpoint) and the CGI-S scale (secondary endpoint) with the last observation carried forward. The average score on the NPI agitation domain subscale and the CGI-S scale at Baseline and Week 10 as rated by the two caregivers were compared. A 30% drop in the NPI agitation domain subscale in 50% of the persons living with AD/ADRD was considered a clinically meaningful finding.
Over thirteen months of recruitment, 9 triads were identified in 6 residential care facilities in three Midwestern states. For the NPI agitation domain, 6 of 9 (67%) persons with AD/ADRD had a 30% reduction in the average caregiver ratings at Week 10.

40019895,Innovations in noninvasive sensory stimulation treatments to combat Alzheimer's disease.,,PLoS biology,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. There is no known cure for AD, highlighting an urgent need for new, innovative treatments. Recent studies have shed light on a promising, noninvasive approach using sensory stimulation as a potential therapy for AD. Exposing patients to light and sound pulses at a frequency of 40 hertz induces brain rhythms in the gamma frequency range that are important for healthy brain activity. Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions. Concurrent advancements in neurotechnology that can also noninvasively stimulate healthy brain rhythms are illuminating new possibilities for alternative therapies. Altogether, these noninvasive approaches could herald a new era in treating AD, making them a beacon of hope for patients, families, and caregivers facing the challenges of this debilitating condition.",,,,"Copyright: © 2025 Park, Tsai.

Y.)","In Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials, including trials enrolling patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), participants must enroll with a study partner (SP). SPs ensure compliance and are a source of study data, including assessments of the participant's cognition and function. Consistency in SP reporting is essential to trial data integrity.
We quantified SP replacement and its impact on bias and variance of SP-reported AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living for MCI (ADCS-ADL-MCI) in the ADCS Vitamin E/Donepezil MCI Trial. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between SP type (spouse or non-spouse) and the odds of experiencing SP change. We used generalized estimating equations to longitudinally model the differences in consecutively recorded ADCS-ADL-MCI scores as a function of whether SP change occurred. We used a similar model to quantify end-of-study change from baseline in ADCS-ADL-MCI scores.
Among 768 participants, 40 (5%) experienced at least one SP change. We estimated that the odds of experiencing a SP change were 65% lower for spousal dyads when compared to non-spousal dyads (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.18-0.67]). Compared to those with a consistent SP, participants who experienced a SP change had, on average, a consecutive visit absolute score difference that was 1.60 points greater in magnitude (95% CI: [0.62-2.57]), suggesting greater volatility. ADCS-ADL-MCI scores were neither systematically higher nor lower when SP change occurred, on average (-0.23; 95% CI: [-1.60, 1.14]), suggesting minimal bias. The estimated difference in variance for end-of-study change from baseline ADCS-ADL-MCI was observed to be higher for those with SP change compared to those without, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.29; 95% CI: [0.47-1.17]).

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a single nonpharmacological intervention on cognitive functioning in older adults with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in the first week of January 2024, searching eight electronic databases for articles that reflect on non-pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's disease published between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 2023. All included articles had to be randomized controlled trials. The primary measure was the change in cognitive function before and after the intervention. Data were extracted by two authors and quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook. With the exception of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale [MD=2.99, 95% CI (-0.66,6.63)], the differences between the intervention group and the control group were significant for all the remaining scales, namely, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [SMD=0.65, 95% CI (0.15,1.15)], Activity of Daily Living Scale (ADL) [MD=-2.30, 95% CI (-3.63,0.97)], Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD) [MD=5.03, 95% CI (2.27,7.78)], Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [MD=-2.16, 95% CI (-3.86,0.46)], and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive score (ADAS-cog) [MD=-5.21, 95% CI (-7.89,2.54)]. Subgroup analysis revealed that the most effective intervention was exercise therapy, followed by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. On the other hand, music therapy was not found to be effective.

40015754,Protocol for an intergenerational randomized controlled trial to enhance physical activity in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease, behavioral intervention, clinical trial, intergenerational, physical activity",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,"Physical inactivity is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease in North America. Despite this, most older adults are physically inactive. It is currently unknown how to successfully motivate physical activity behavior in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease, and this knowledge is crucial for early and effective disease prevention. Prior research has shown that intergenerational social engagement and prosocial behaviours can enhance the health and well-being of older adults.
This manuscript describes the design of a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to enhance physical activity in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.
This is a single-blinded, two-arm stratified randomized controlled trial that incorporates a hybrid efficacy and implementation design. Participants are randomized to an intervention or control condition in a 1:1 ratio and are stratified by a multimodal Alzheimer's disease risk score. All study visits are conducted remotely through videoconferencing.
The study aims to recruit 60 older adults with a first-degree family history of Alzheimer's disease from the PREVENT-AD cohort and 30 younger adults who are paired with older adults in the intervention condition.
Older participants in the intervention group will be paired with younger study partners and receive positive, daily messages over four weeks using a novel technology platform. The daily messages combine intergenerational social engagement (growing a virtual garden with a younger study partner) and prosocial goals (donations to charity after reaching step count goals).
The primary outcome is change in step count compared to baseline measured using a wrist-worn triaxial accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include time spent physically active, mood, generativity, loneliness, and cognition. Target mechanisms (social support and generativity) of physical activity engagement will be examined. Ease of use, acceptability, and feasibility of the technology as well as barriers and facilitators of participation will be assessed.
This research will advance our understanding of mechanisms and individual differences underlying successful physical activity engagement in older adults who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge will contribute to strategies for promoting health behaviours that can prevent the risk of Alzheimer's disease.",,,,Copyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

40015298,"Associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, p-tau181, and cognition in healthy older adults with memory complaints: a secondary analysis from the MAPT.",,The lancet. Healthy longevity,"Physical activity provides benefits against cognitive decline but its associations with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology are not fully understood. We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and phosphorylated (p)-tau181 blood concentrations, and the role of p-tau181 in the associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition.
In this post-hoc secondary analysis, we used data from a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial (the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial [MAPT]), in which adults aged 70 years and older were recruited from the community in 13 memory centres in France and Monaco. Individuals were eligible if they met at least one of the following criteria: spontaneous memory complaints, low gait speed (≤0·77 m/s), or limitation in at least one instrumental activity of daily living. Exclusion criteria included a dementia diagnosis, a Mini Mental State Examination score below 24, and having limitations in basic activities of daily living. For this secondary analysis, participants from MAPT were included if they had blood p-tau181 concentrations measured at baseline or at 3 years, or both timepoints. Self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (in metabolic equivalent of task min per week) and a cognitive composite score (calculated by averaging the Z scores of four cognitive tests) were assessed at baseline and at 6 months and at 1, 2, and 3 years. Mixed-effect models were used to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and p-tau181 concentrations and to explore the mediating and moderating role of p-tau181 concentration on the association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition.
Between May 30, 2008, and Feb 24, 2011, 1679 individuals were enrolled in the MAPT, of whom 558 adults had measurements of p-tau181 concentrations at baseline, 3 years, or both timepoints. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were associated with slower changes in p-tau181 concentrations over time. Compared with inactive individuals, those with low levels of activity (low moderate-to-vigorous physical activity × time: B = -0·109 [95% CI -0·206 to -0·012; p=0·028]) or high levels of activity (high moderate-to-vigorous physical activity × time: B=-0·114 [95% CI -0·208 to -0·020; p=0·018) had a slower increase in p-tau181 concentrations. We did not identify any association between baseline p-tau181 concentrations and baseline moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels. The cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition were attenuated with increasing baseline p-tau181 concentrations. Specifically, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was no longer favourably associated with the cognitive composite score when baseline p-tau181 concentration exceeded 9·36 pg/mL and 3·5 pg/mL for the cross-sectional association and longitudinal association, respectively.
Our findings suggest that engaging in more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity might help to slow the age-related neurodegenerative process, although p-tau pathophysiology seems to mitigate the beneficial associations between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognition in older adults. Verification of these findings in larger population samples will be needed.

40011173,Lecanemab for early Alzheimer's disease: Appropriate use recommendations from the French federation of memory clinics.,"Alzheimer, Biomarker, Clinical practice, Guidelines, Lecanemab",The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease,"Lecanemab, a monoclonal antibody targeting β-amyloid protofibrils, has shown promising results in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been approved by the European Medicines Agency. An Early Market Authorization could be submitted to the French regulatory agencies, potentially allowing for the drug's use in clinical practice in France in 2025. To guide French clinicians in administering lecanemab in a standardized way, the French Federation of Memory Clinics has developed appropriate use recommendations for lecanemab that highlight relevant questions established to ensure an optimal risk-benefit ratio. The recommendations emphasize that lecanemab treatment requires a comprehensive individualized evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio, which should occur in multidisciplinary meetings. When approved, the guidelines support the use of blood biomarkers, proposing specific cutoffs for patients eligible for lecanemab under restricted conditions. In addition to the European Medicines Agency restrictions in patients on anticoagulants, and APOE4 homozygotes, the guidelines recommend against lecanemab treatment for patients with high amyloid-related hemorrhagic risk such as probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Boston criteria v1.5) until further data become available. Additionally, we recommend that MRI monitoring be started before the third infusion to account for early Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA) occurring on lecanemab. It is recommended to establish a specific clinical care pathway with protocols for patients with ARIA, with trained physicians and radiologists with expertise in neurological emergency and intensive care. Finally, a discontinuation protocol based on dementia severity assessment after 18 months of lecanemab treatment is suggested. Access to lecanemab requires a personalized biological and genetic diagnosis of AD, which is currently not necessary in most cases. Therefore, the healthcare system must rapidly adjust to new diagnostic procedures and treatment delivery to ensure equal access for all individuals.",,,,Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

40010154,A pilot study of senolytics to improve cognition and mobility in older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,"Ageing, Cognitive impairment, Flavonoids, Gait, Geroscience, Senolytics",EBioMedicine,"This single-arm study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of two senolytic agents, Dasatinib and Quercetin (DQ), in older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Participants took 100 mg of Dasatinib and 1250 mg of Quercetin for two days every two weeks over 12 weeks. Recruitment rate, adverse events, absolute changes in functional outcomes, and percent changes in biomarkers were calculated. Spearman correlations between functional and biomarker outcomes were performed.
Approximately 10% of telephone-screened individuals completed the intervention (n = 12). There were no serious adverse events related to the intervention. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores non-significantly increased following DQ by 1.0 point (95% CI: -0.7, 2.7), but increased significantly by 2.0 points (95% CI: 0.1, 4.0) in those with lowest baseline MoCA scores. Mean percent change in tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a key product of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), non-significantly decreased following DQ by -3.0% (95% CI: -13.0, 7.1). Changes in TNF-α were significantly and inversely correlated with changes in MoCA scores (r = -0.65, p = 0.02), such that reductions in TNF- α were correlated with increases in MoCA scores.
This study suggests that intermittent DQ treatment is feasible and safe; data hint at potential functional benefits in older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease. The observed reduction in TNF-α and its correlation with increases in MoCA scores suggests that DQ may improve cognition by modulating the SASP. However, there was not an appropriate control group. Data are preliminary and must be interpreted cautiously.

40009384,Ultrasound Neuromodulation With Transcranial Pulse Stimulation in Alzheimer Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,,JAMA network open,"Given the increasing prevalence of dementia and the limited treatment options available, ultrasound neuromodulation could serve as a novel add-on therapy to standard treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD). As ultrasound neuromodulation is still in its early stages, further research is essential to fully explore its potential in treating brain disorders.
To evaluate clinical and functional imaging effects of transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) in patients with AD.
A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted at the Medical University of Vienna between January 1, 2017, and July 27, 2022. Sixty patients with clinically diagnosed AD receiving state-of-the-art treatment were randomly allocated to treatment sequence groups verum-sham (first cycle verum, second cycle sham, n = 30) and sham-verum (n = 30). Data analysis was performed from July 28, 2022, to September 5, 2024.
Each participant received 6 verum and 6 sham TPS sessions (6000 pulses, 0.20 mJ/mm2, 5 Hz) to frontoparietal brain areas.
Neuropsychological tests, including the primary outcome Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) corrected total score (CTS), were performed at baseline and 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months following the stimulations in each cycle. Primary and secondary outcomes, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and Beck Depression Inventory-II, were analyzed by intention-to-treat analysis and, for sensitivity, by per protocol analysis.
For the intention-to-treat analysis, 60 patients between ages 51 and 82 years (mean [SD], 70.65 [8.16] years; 30 females; 30 males) were included. The CERAD CTS increased by a mean (SD) of 2.22 (6.87) points in the verum condition from 70.93 (14.27) points at baseline to 73.15 (14.90) 3 months after stimulation, while the mean (SD) score in the sham condition increased by 1.00 (6.82) point vs baseline from 71.68 (13.62] at baseline to 72.68 (14.48) 3 months after stimulation. Primary data analysis of the condition × session interaction was not significant (P = .68; partial η2 [ηp2] = 0.01), but its interaction with age was P = .003; ηp2 = 0.08, followed by post hoc analyses of age subsamples. Although several patients older than 70 years benefited from verum TPS, only the younger subgroup (≤70 years) showed significantly higher CTS increases for verum in all poststimulation sessions (condition × session: P = .005; ηp2 = 0.16). At 3 months after stimulation, for example, a mean (SD) 3.91 (7.86)-point increase was found for verum TPS in the younger patients, but a mean (SD) CTS decrease of 1.83 (5.80) was observed for sham. Memory-associated brain activation was significantly higher after verum TPS in the precuneus, visual, and frontal areas, while resting state functional connectivity was significantly upregulated in the dorsal attention network. In the per protocol sample, a significant reduction of the Beck Depression Inventory-II scores 3 months following verum TPS was found (verum baseline: 7.27 [5.87]; verum 3 months after stimulation: 5.27 [5.27]; sham baseline: 6.70 [5.65]; sham 3 months after stimulation: 6.22 [4.40]; P = .008; ηp2 = 0.23). During both verum and sham conditions, the most common observed adverse symptom was depression; no major neuropathologic change was detected in the patients by detailed neuroradiologic assessments.
In this randomized clinical trial of TPS in patients with AD, a 2-week verum treatment improved cognitive scores in the younger subgroup, ameliorated depressive symptoms, and induced upregulation of functional brain activation and connectivity. These findings suggest TPS may be a safe and promising add-on therapy for patients with AD receiving state-of-the-art treatment.

They also pass without difficulty through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study focused on natural substances and their effects on AD by using academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2024. According to the literature review, 66 phytoconstituents that were isolated from 21 distinct plants have shown efficacy, which could be encouraging for future research on AD therapies. Since most clinical trials produce contradictory results, the study suggests that larger-scale studies with longer treatment durations are necessary to validate or refute the therapeutic efficacy of herbal AD treatments.",,,,,10.3390/molecules30040922,2025-02-26,"Amin Mahmood Thawabteh, Aseel Wasel Ghanem, Sara AbuMadi, Dania Thaher, Weam Jaghama, Donia Karaman, Rafik Karaman"
40000152,A Federated Data Analysis Approach for the Evaluation of Surrogate Endpoints.,"federated data, meta‐analytic framework, surrogacy",Pharmaceutical statistics,"In clinical trials, surrogate endpoints, that are more cost-effective, occur earlier, or are more frequently measured, are sometimes used to replace costly, late, or rare true endpoints. Regulatory authorities typically require thorough evaluation and validation to accept these surrogate endpoints as reliable substitutes. To this end, the meta-analytic framework is considered a very viable approach to validate surrogates at both trial and individual levels. However, this framework requires data from multiple trials or centers, posing challenges when data sharing is not feasible. In this article, we propose a federated data analysis approach that allows organizations to maintain control over their datasets while still enabling surrogate validation through meta-analytic techniques. In this approach, there is no longer a need for raw data sharing. Instead, independent analyses are conducted at each organization. Thereafter, the results of these independent analyses are aggregated at a central analysis hub and the metrics for surrogate evaluation are extracted. We apply this approach to simulated and real clinical data, demonstrating how this federated approach can overcome data-sharing constraints and validate surrogate endpoints in decentralized settings.",,,,© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1002/pst.70003,2025-02-26,"Dries De Witte, Ariel Alonso Abad, Diane Stephenson, Yashmin Karten, Antoine Leuzy, Gregory Klein, Geert Molenberghs"

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was conducted using relevant keywords such as ""donanemab"", ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Kisunla"", ""TRAILBLAZER clinical trials"", and ""amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)"". Additional data were extracted from clinical trial records (clinicaltrials.gov), conference abstracts, and product monographs.
Only English-language studies conducted in human populations were included. Clinical trials and peer-reviewed studies detailing the efficacy, safety, and mechanistic insights of donanemab-azbt were prioritized.
Key findings from the TRAILBLAZER series of clinical trials highlighted the potential of donanemab-azbt in slowing cognitive and functional decline in early-stage AD: (1) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ (Phase 2): This trial focused on participants with intermediate levels of tau protein. Results demonstrated a statistically significant slowing of cognitive and functional decline. (2) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 (Phase 3): A large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study confirmed the efficacy of donanemab-azbt in reducing amyloid plaque accumulation and cognitive decline. Key results included a 35% slowing of decline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and a 36% slowing on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Additional secondary outcomes showed improvements in activities of daily living and reduced risk of disease progression. (3) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3: This ongoing trial is evaluating donanemab's potential in delaying or preventing Alois Alzheimer in cognitively normal individuals with amyloid plaques, broadening the scope of early intervention strategies. (4) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4: A head-to-head comparison with aducanumab revealed superior amyloid plaque clearance with donanemab. (5) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 5: Currently recruiting, this trial aims to evaluate safety and efficacy across diverse populations with varying tau levels and comorbidities. (6) TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 (Phase 3b): This trial investigates modified dosing regimens to reduce ARIA while maintaining efficacy, particularly in populations with genetic risk factors like ApoE ε4 homozygotes.
Donanemab-azbt represents a promising treatment option for patients with early-stage AD. It specifically targets and reduces amyloid beta plaques, a hallmark of the disease, potentially slowing progression and preserving cognitive function. However, its administration requires careful patient selection, including genetic testing for ApoE ε4 status, to mitigate risks of ARIA. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the importance of close monitoring during treatment.
Donanemab-azbt offers a new avenue for managing early-stage AD, showing promise in reducing amyloid burden and slowing cognitive decline. While its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical trials, further research is essential to validate long-term outcomes, assess effectiveness across diverse populations, and refine dosing strategies to minimize side effects. With continued investigation, donanemab-azbt could significantly impact the clinical landscape of AD treatment.",,,,,10.3390/pharmacy13010023,2025-02-25,"Nadia Khartabil, Ayda Awaness"

They remain a significant focus of scientific and clinical interest due to their increasing medical and social importance. Most neurodegenerative diseases present intracellular protein aggregation or their extracellular deposition (plaques), such as α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and amyloid beta (Aβ)/tau aggregates in Alzheimer's. Conventional treatments for neurodegenerative conditions incur high costs and are related to the development of several adverse effects. In addition, many patients are irresponsive to them. For these reasons, there is a growing tendency to find new therapeutic approaches to help patients. This review intends to investigate some phytocompounds' effects on neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions are generally related to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, so phytocompounds can help prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve our aim to provide a critical assessment of the current literature about phytochemicals targeting neurodegeneration, we reviewed reputable databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and COCHRANE, seeking clinical trials that utilized phytochemicals against neurodegenerative conditions. A few clinical trials investigated the effects of phytocompounds in humans, and after screening, 13 clinical trials were ultimately included following PRISMA guidelines. These compounds include polyphenols (flavonoids such as luteolin and quercetin, phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, and caffeic acid, and other polyphenols like resveratrol), alkaloids (such as berberine, huperzine A, and caffeine), and terpenoids (such as ginkgolides and limonene). The gathered evidence underscores that quercetin, caffeine, ginkgolides, and other phytochemicals are primarily anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective, counteracting neuroinflammation, neuronal oxidation, and synaptic dysfunctions, which are crucial aspects of neurodegenerative disease intervention in various included conditions, such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, depression, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, they show that the use of these compounds is related to significant improvements in cognition, memory, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant behavior, hallucinations, and mood disorders.",,,,,10.3390/metabo15020124,2025-02-25,"Enzo Pereira de Lima, Lucas Fornari Laurindo, Vitor Cavallari Strozze Catharin, Rosa Direito, Masaru Tanaka, Iris Jasmin Santos German, Caroline Barbalho Lamas, Elen Landgraf Guiguer, Adriano Cressoni Araújo, Adriana Maria Ragassi Fiorini, Sandra Maria Barbalho"

As studies continue to search for ways to combat the development and progression of AD, it is imperative to ensure that confident diagnoses can be made before the onset of severe clinical symptoms and new therapies can be evaluated effectively. Tau positron emission tomography (PET) has emerged as one method that may be capable of both, given its ability to recognize the presence of tau, a primary pathologic hallmark of AD; its usefulness in determining the spatial distribution of tau, which is necessary for differentiating AD from other tauopathies; and its association with measures of cognition. This review aims to evaluate the scope of tau PET's utility in clinical trials and practice. Firstly, the potential of using tau PET for differential diagnoses, distinguishing AD from other dementias, is considered. Next, the value of tau PET as a tool for staging disease progression is investigated. Finally, tau PET as a prognostic method for identifying the individuals most at risk of cognitive decline and, therefore, most in need of, and likely to benefit from, intervention, is discussed.",,,,,10.3390/geriatrics10010027,2025-02-25,"Alexandra Gogola, Brian J Lopresti, Davneet S Minhas, Oscar Lopez, Ann Cohen, Victor L Villemagne"

Emerging evidence suggests that RhoA, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), and their downstream effector molecule glycogen synthase 3β (GSK3β) interact within a complex signaling pathway (RhoA/ROCK/GSK3β) that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. RhoA, a small GTPase, along with its downstream effector, ROCK, regulates various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity. GSK3β, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a key role in neuronal function and AD pathology, including the regulation of tau phosphorylation and amyloid-beta cleavage. Overactive GSK3β has been closely linked to tau hyperphosphorylation, neurodegeneration, and the progression of AD. Thus, GSK3β has been considered as a promising therapeutic target for treating AD and mitigating cognitive impairment. However, clinical trials of GSK3β in AD have faced considerable challenges due to the complexity of the specific neuronal inhibition of GSK3β. In this review, we summarize the literature regarding the relationship of RhoA/ROCK and GSK3β signaling pathways in AD pathogenesis. We further discuss recent findings of the sTREM2-transgelin-2 (TG2) axis as a potential mediator of this complex pathway and provide our review on a novel targeting strategy for AD.",,,,,10.3390/cimb47020124,2025-02-25,"Milan M Medd, Jayden E Yon, Hongxin Dong"

Understanding the intricate interplay between biological aging and the AD pathophysiology may help to discover innovative treatments. The relationship between aging and core pathways of AD pathogenesis (amyloidopathy and tauopathy) have been extensively studied in preclinical models. However, the potential discordance between preclinical models and human pathology could represent a limitation in the identification of new therapeutic targets. This narrative review aims to gather the evidence currently available on the associations of β-Amyloid and Tau pathology with the hallmarks of aging in human studies. Briefly, our review suggests that while several hallmarks exhibit a robust association with AD pathogenesis (e.g., epigenetic alterations, chronic inflammation, dysbiosis), others (e.g., telomere attrition, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion) demonstrate either no relationship or weak associations. This is often due to limitations such as small sample sizes and study designs, being either cross-sectional or with short follow-up intervals, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Distinct hallmarks play varying roles in different stages of AD pathology, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies with longer follow-up periods.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), is approved for use in type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity.
evoke (NCT04777396) and evoke+ (NCT04777409) are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Eligible individuals were 55-85 years, amyloid-positive, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥22. Participants were randomized 1:1 to once-daily oral semaglutide 14 mg (titrated from 3 mg for the initial 4 weeks and 7 mg for the following 4 weeks) or placebo plus standard of care for 156 weeks (104 weeks + 52-week extension). The primary endpoint is change in the CDR - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Baseline characteristics of enrolled patients were compiled after completion of enrollment on September 8, 2023. Trials are ongoing, data may be subject to minor changes until database lock.

ARIA is an important safety concern associated with the class of ATTs. Identifying patient characteristics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and modifiable factors potentially contributing to ARIA risk is paramount to inform use of ATTs in clinical practice.
This post-hoc exploratory analysis evaluated data from 2031 donanemab-exposed participants in the phase 2 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study (NCT03367403), the phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 study (NCT04437511), and the open-label TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 addendum. TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 participants had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease with amyloid and tau pathology (via PET). Addendum enrollment required PET evidence of amyloid, but participants without tau pathology were eligible. Participants received donanemab every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks and stopped treatment if amyloid PET-based completion criteria were met. Hypothesis-generating penalized regression and decision tree-based models were employed to identify variables associated with ARIA-edema and effusions (ARIA-E).

Minimal clinically important differences and the priorities of individuals living with dementia for everyday function.,"dementia, detection, disease continuum, everyday function, minimally clinically important difference","Alzheimer's & dementia (New York, N. Y.)","Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a significant impact on an individual's functional cognitive abilities, highlighting the need to prioritize measures of function in evaluating minimally clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds in AD/ADRD research. Input directly from individuals living with AD/ADRD on measures of function are lacking in MCID discussions, including what it means to live with AD/ADRD and what type and degree of improvements are most meaningful across the disease continuum. Most measures for assessing function in AD/ADRD trials are largely focused on basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADL, IADL), which lack aspects of everyday function that matter most to individuals living with AD/ADRD. Expanding outcome evaluation to other dimensions of everyday function and diversifying measurement approaches is essential for optimizing inclusion of personally meaningful aspects of everyday function prioritized by individuals living with AD/ADRD and improving detection of potentially more sensitive changes in functioning. This perspective outlines four directions to expand and integrate what matters most to individuals living with AD/ADRD into trial outcome evaluation, including (1) consideration of how what matters most to individuals living with AD/ADRD may change across the disease continuum from mild to advanced dementia, (2) identification and evaluation of goals around strengths-based domains such as social participation rather than solely emphasizing deficits and losses, (3) utilization of goal-attainment scaling to more specifically match individually-specific functional goals, and (4) strengthening the inclusion and use of self-report and performance-based measures of function and triangulating these measures with informant-report measures.
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) have a significant impact on an individual' functional cognitive abilities, of which changes in these abilities are measured through detection of minimally clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds to determine the effectiveness of AD/ADRD clinical trials.Widely used measures for assessing MCID thresholds in AD/ADRD trials focus on basic and instrumental activities of daily living, presenting opportunities to expand measurement of MCID to account for other dimensions of everyday function that are prioritized by individuals living with AD/ADRD.To expand outcome evaluation and improve integration of aspects of functioning that matter most to people living with AD/ADRD, we identify opportunities to incorporate more diverse strategies via goal-attainment scaling, self-report, and performance-based measures as appropriate. We also highlight the importance of incorporating strengths-based domains such as social participation, moving beyond deficit-focused assessment of functioning.",,,,© 2025 The Author(s).

The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD) caused by mutations. On the basis of findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab arm of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab.
The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before to 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of gantenerumab up to 1500 mg subcutaneous every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a pre-specified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-SB. The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure PiB-PET SUVR at 3 years, assessed in the modified intention to treat population (defined as participants who received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET SUVR assessment prior to gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE (NCT06424236) are registered with clinicaltrials.gov.
Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020 and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons. The mITT population for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0.79 (n=53, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.32) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0.53 (n=22, 0.27 to 1.03) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0.71 SUVR (95% CI -0.88 to -0.53, p<0.0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39/73) of participants: 47% (34/73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22/73) with oedema, and 6% (5/73) were associated with symptoms. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred.
Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long term trials.

39973500,A possible pathway to freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease, amyloid, freezing of gait, inflammation, norepinephrine",Journal of Parkinson's disease,"Freezing of gait (FOG), a common, perplexing gait disorder observed in Parkinson's disease (PD), is a leading cause of injurious falls and contributes significantly to social isolation. Unlike other PD cardinal features, FOG appears to develop independently, and its heterogeneity presents challenges for both definition and measurement. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FOG remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective treatments. Although the roles of specific, targetable biomarkers in FOG development remain unidentified, evidence suggests that it is likely multimodal, potentially involving extranigral transmitter circuits. The diversity of FOG phenotypes may also reflect underlying differences in pathophysiology. In this paper, we first present evidence that FOG may occur independently of dopaminergic influence. We then review an expanding body of research supporting the hypothesis that FOG arises from a dysfunctional pathophysiological feedback loop, involving norepinephrine (NE) depletion, neuroinflammation, and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. This biological disruption occurs concurrently with, but distinct from, the primary dopaminergic pathology of PD. When they occur on the background of dopamine loss, the interactions between NE, Aβ, and inflammation, as observed in Alzheimer's disease models, may similarly play a critical role in the development of FOG in PD and could serve as pathobiological markers. The proposed changes in the pathophysiological loop might even precede its onset, highlighting the need for further investigation. A deeper understanding of the involvement of Aβ, NE, and inflammatory markers in FOG could pave the way for rapid clinical trials to test existing amyloid-clearing therapies and noradrenergic drugs in appropriate patient populations.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease associated with the loss of dopamine in the brain. Freezing of gait (FOG) is a complex abnormality of walking seen in people with PD where they feel like their feet are glued to the floor. It is common (affecting up to 60% of patients), a leading cause of injurious falls and contributes significantly to social isolation. It appears to develop and progress separately from other clinical symptoms of PD. Cognitive impairment is frequently associated with FOG. The cause is unknown, and treatment is limited. It is well known that there are several types of FOG suggesting that there might be more than one cause. There is also information suggesting that FOG, in some cases, may occur independent of the loss of dopamine that typically occurs in PD. In this paper we review information supporting that notion. Then, we develop our hypothesis of a different chemical pathway as a possible cause of FOG. This pathway involves the protein amyloid (too much in the brain) and the chemical norepinephrine (too little in the brain), both have been previously related to the development of Alzheimer's disease. We review the literature (including some of our work) that supports the possible role of this chemical pathway in the development of FOG. A deeper understanding of this chemical pathway in FOG could pave the way for the development of new effective drugs in appropriate patient populations.",,,,,10.1177/1877718X241308487,2025-02-20,"Stewart A Factor, David Weinshenker, J Lucas McKay"

In this viewpoint, we discuss the primary drivers behind these efforts, the future directions, and the challenges that must be addressed. While finding biomarkers is a mandatory step for better precision medicine and optimal patient stratification in therapeutic trials, we argue that a biological definition of Parkinson's disease based on a single biomarker will struggle to account for the complexity of the mechanisms involved in developing the disease. Additionally, a biological definition of asymptomatic patients should rely on a thorough understanding of patients' clinical trajectories, which is currently not the case in synucleinopathies.
Two recent articles proposed a biological definition of Parkinson's disease, highlighting the importance of detecting aggregated alpha-synuclein in biofluids or tissues. This viewpoint explores the motivations behind these proposals, their potential implications, and the challenges they face.

The emergence of innovative therapeutic approaches, such as whole-body hyperthermia (WBH), offers promising potential to modulate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in NDs and related conditions like Long COVID. WBH, particularly in fever-range, enhances mitochondrial function, induces heat shock proteins (HSPs), and modulates neuroinflammation-benefits that pharmacological treatments often struggle to replicate. HSPs such as HSP70 and HSP90 play pivotal roles in protein folding, aggregation prevention, and cellular protection, directly targeting pathological processes seen in NDs like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. Preliminary findings also suggest WBH's potential to alleviate neurological symptoms in Long COVID, where persistent neuroinflammation and serotonin dysregulation are prominent. Despite the absence of robust clinical trials, the therapeutic implications of WBH extend to immune modulation and the restoration of disrupted physiological pathways. However, the dual nature of hyperthermia's effects-balancing pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses-emphasizes the need for dose-controlled applications and stringent patient monitoring to minimize risks in vulnerable populations. While WBH shows potential interest, significant challenges remain. These include individual variability in response, limited accessibility to advanced hyperthermia technologies, and the need for standardized clinical protocols. Future research must focus on targeted clinical trials, biomarker identification, and personalized treatment strategies to optimize WBH's efficacy in NDs and Long COVID.

Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) enzyme is implicated in neurodegeneration, and developing inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic strategy. This review explores MAO-B activity molecular pathways, evaluates MAO-B inhibitors in neurodegenerative therapy, identifies challenges, and suggests future research directions. This review synthesizes findings from a range of scientific literature, including experimental studies, clinical trials, and biochemical analyses that focus on the role of MAO-B in neurodegeneration. Information was gathered from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, ensuring a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in MAO-B inhibition strategies. The review reveals several promising MAO-B inhibitors that have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models, as well as some that have progressed to clinical trials. Compounds such as rasagiline and selegiline have shown neuroprotective effects and benefits in symptom management in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the review discusses novel inhibitors that target specific molecular pathways, enhancing the potential for improved therapeutic outcomes. However, several inhibitors also present challenges regarding their selectivity, side effects, and long-term efficacy.

However, neuroinflammation and complement activation may play a role in disease progression.
To determine the effects of zilucoplan, an inhibitor of complement C5, in individuals with ALS.
Zilucoplan was tested as regimen A of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a phase 2 to 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled perpetual platform clinical trial with sharing of trial infrastructure and placebo data across multiple regimens. Regimen A was conducted from August 17, 2020, to May 4, 2022. A total of 162 participants were randomized to receive zilucoplan (122 [75.3%]) or regimen-specific placebo (40 [24.7%]). An additional 124 concurrently randomized participants were randomized to receive placebo in other regimens.
Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive zilucoplan or matching placebo within strata of edaravone and/or riluzole use for a planned duration of 24 weeks. Active drug (zilucoplan, 0.3 mg/kg) and placebo were provided for daily subcutaneous dosing.
The primary end point was change in disease severity from baseline through 24 weeks as measured by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) total score and survival, analyzed using a bayesian shared-parameter model and reported as disease rate ratio (DRR; <1 indicating treatment benefit). The study included prespecified rules for early stopping for futility. Outcome analyses were performed in the full analysis set comparing the zilucoplan group with the total shared placebo group (n = 164).
Among the 162 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 59.6 [11.3]; 99 [61.1%] male), 115 (71.0%) completed the trial. The estimated DRR common to ALSFRS-R and survival was 1.08 (95% credible interval, 0.87-1.31; posterior probability of superiority, 0.24). The trial was stopped early for futility. No unexpected treatment-related risks were identified.
In this randomized clinical trial of zilucoplan in ALS, treatment did not alter disease progression. The adaptive platform design of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial made it possible to test a new investigational product with efficient use of time and resources.

However, little is known about the prognostic value of this classification in order to better stratify patients for the clinical trials.
To assess the impact of the different clinical phenotypes according to the MDS-PSP classification on prognosis using the clinical milestones of death, severe dysphagia, institutionalization, and need for walking aid.
A prospective cohort of 205 PSP patients from Lille University Hospital was analyzed retrospectively. Patients were classified into different MSD-PSP phenotypes according to their clinical presentation after 3 years of follow-up. The milestones of death, severe dysphagia, institutionalization, and need for walking aid were recorded, and a survival analysis was performed to describe the prognosis of each disease presentation.
Median survival time was 6.4 (interquartile range (IQR): 4.8-8.6) years and mean diagnostic delay from symptom onset was 38.1 ± 22.5 months. PSP Richardson Syndrome (PSP-RS) had a poorer survival rate and a higher occurrence of severe dysphagia and need for walking aid compared to PSP variants such as PSP Parkinsonism (PSP-P), PSP postural instability without ocular motor dysfunction (PSP-PI), and other rare phenotypes.
PSP-RS has a less favorable prognosis compared to PSP variants stratified according to the MDS-PSP classification. This classification could assist in selecting patients for clinical trials and help design outcomes that account for the disease heterogeneity.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and debilitating neurodegenerative disease marked by diverse combination of motor and cognitive symptoms. No treatment is currently available to slow down disease progression. The multiple clinical presentations of PSP compromise clinical trials. Thus, we aimed to study the differential prognosis of the different forms of the disease. We showed that PSP-Richardson Syndrome (PSP-RS), which is the most frequent presentation, seems to have a poorer prognosis than other variants on survival and other disability criteria such as severe dysphagia occurrence.

Accurately measuring reliable cognitive change in individual patients with EOAD will have great value for these trials.
The current study sought to characterize and validate 12-month reliable change from the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Study (LEADS) neuropsychological battery.
Standardized regression-based (SRB) prediction equations were developed from age-matched cognitively intact participants within LEADS, and applied to clinically impaired participants from LEADS.
Participants were recruited from outpatient academic medical centers.
Participants were enrolled in LEADS and diagnosed with amyloid-positive EOAD (n = 189) and amyloid-negative early-onset cognitive impairment not related to AD (EOnonAD; n = 43).
12-month reliable change (Z-scores) was compared between groups across cognitive domain composites, and distributions of individual participant trajectories were examined. Prediction of Z-scores by common AD biomarkers was also considered.
Both EOAD and EOnonAD displayed significantly lower 12-month follow-up scores than were predicted based on SRB equations, with declines more pronounced for EOAD across several domains. AD biomarkers of cerebral β-amyloid, tau, and EOAD-specific atrophy were predictive of 12-month change scores.
The current results support including EOAD patients in longitudinal clinical trials, and generate evidence of validation for using 12-month reliable cognitive change as a clinical outcome metric in clinical trials in EOAD cohorts like LEADS. Doing so will enhance the success of EOAD trials and permit a better understanding of individual responses to treatment.",,"Both EOAD and EOnonAD displayed significantly lower 12-month follow-up scores than were predicted based on SRB equations, with declines more pronounced for EOAD across several domains.

To effectively assess the relationship between TJA and brain metal concentrations, subjects with and without TJA were matched for baseline clinical characteristics and showed no difference in postmortem Alzheimer's disease neuropathic change. TJA subjects had increased concentrations of cobalt and titanium and both metals were associated with increased amyloid plaques. In both the TJA and non-TJA subjects, increased concentrations of cobalt, titanium, manganese, and molybdenum were associated with increased odds of neuritic and diffuse plaques. Lastly, the brain's inter-metal correlations were altered in the presence of increased neuritic plaques and/or implantable artificial joints.

However, current evidence is limited to observational and pre-clinical studies. We conducted a drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the on-target effects of pharmacological PDE5 inhibition on dementia subtypes and related phenotypes. We selected variants from around the PDE5A locus associated with diastolic and systolic blood pressure, as well as circulating PDE5A levels, to create three instruments for genetically proxied PDE5A inhibition. Using two-sample MR, we validated the instruments against erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension before assessing their associations with dementia subtypes, dementia-related proteins, and neuroimaging traits. After correcting for multiple comparisons, genetically proxied PDE5 inhibition, per one SD lower in diastolic blood pressure, was associated with higher odds of Alzheimer's disease (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and Lewy body dementia (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23-1.41), but a trend towards lower odds of vascular dementia across all instruments. Genetically proxied PDE5 inhibition was associated with both beneficial and adverse effects on brain MRI traits. This included lower volumes of white matter hyperintensities (SD change - 0.035, 95% CI - 0.025, - 0.045), indicating potential benefits, but also reduced volumes of other structures, including the thalamus, suggesting potential adverse effects. PDE5 inhibition was associated with the concentrations of several proteins implicated in dementia pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that while PDE5 inhibition may be associated with a lower risk of vascular dementia, possibly by preventing white matter hyperintensities, it may increase risk of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia, warranting further investigation before clinical trials.",,,,© 2025.

There are currently no drugs or devices that have been clinically shown in humans to enhance brain toxin removal, either during sleep or wakefulness. This perspective article focuses on a recently (re)discovered major route of toxin drainage from the human brain through meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) and the primary enhancer of their flow-the cytokine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The purpose of this perspective article is to present pre-clinical and clinical evidence relevant to a new bioengineered technology (Transcranial Radiofrequency Treatment; TRFT) that appears to enhance mLV flow to increase brain toxin cleansing in humans during wakefulness. In being both safe and non-invasive, TRFT is administered in-home, presently through a device called ""MemorEM"". Two months of daily TRFT during wakefulness increased the typically low plasma/brain levels of VEGF in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) subjects, which was associated with increased Aβ and tau toxin removal from their brains during wakefulness-ostensibly through VEGF-increased mLV flow. Even irrespective of baseline VEGF levels, brain toxin cleansing was increased by TRFT in AD subjects, who also experienced a notable reversal of their cognitive impairment after TRFT. Additional clinical studies are nonetheless required to firmly establish TRFT's brain cleansing abilities during wakefulness. In performing a major duty of sleep, TRFT during wakefulness is proposed as a viable intervention to counter the decline in nighttime brain toxin cleansing that occurs with aging and in multiple brain diseases, most notably Alzheimer's Disease. The implications of TRFT for insomnia and for sleep deprivation are also discussed, as is the potential for TRFT to extend healthy human longevity.",,,,,10.3390/jcm14030926,2025-02-13,Gary W Arendash

This review explores the current understanding of 11β-HSD1 in AD, examining genetic, preclinical, and clinical research. Genetic studies have identified 11β-HSD1 polymorphisms that may influence AD risk, although findings remain inconsistent. Mechanistically, 11β-HSD1 promotes neurodegeneration through the dysregulation of glucocorticoid activity, contributing to hippocampal atrophy, amyloid plaque formation, and tau pathology. Preclinical studies have shown that 11β-HSD1 inhibitors offer neuroprotective effects, including enhanced cognitive function, reduced inflammation, and improved mitochondrial activity. However, clinical trials, including those involving ABT-384 and Xanamem, have produced mixed results, with no substantial cognitive improvements despite effective enzyme inhibition. These inconsistencies highlight the complexity of AD and the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical outcomes. Moreover, while 11β-HSD1 inhibition holds therapeutic potential, other strategies targeting neuroinflammation, autophagy, and glucocorticoid signaling are also being explored. Ongoing research is focusing on optimizing 11β-HSD1 inhibitors, identifying biomarkers for patient selection, and investigating combination therapies to enhance treatment efficacy. Ultimately, 11β-HSD1's role in AD presents a promising therapeutic target, but further studies are required to fully understand its potential in managing the disease.",,,,,10.3390/ijms26031357,2025-02-13,"Mariangela Di Vincenzo, Pamela Pellegrino, Genny Schiappa, Anna Campanati, Valerio Del Vescovo, Silvia Piccirillo, Patrizia Ambrogini, Giorgio Arnaldi, Monia Orciani"
